4372176,103480,2020-09-02T15:57:46-04:00,"Shares of Zillow have zoomed up ~2x since the start of the year and are trading near all-time highs.
        The company has proven that, despite a sharp and short hit to revenue in Q2, that the long-term tailwinds for Zillow are very much intact.
        Historic low rates and a surprise rebound in home-buying activity are driving traffic to Zillow's sites.
        Zillow's guidance calls for a sharp rebound in Q3.","Zillow (Z) has long been a stock that required plenty of patience. Like many other tech stocks, Zillow was commonly bashed by many investors for A) losing too much money, especially in its new home-buying segment, and B) being in a competitive space. So far this year, however, Zillow has demonstrated tremendous pandemic execution while also showcasing the fact that its platform - the premier collection of websites for consumer real estate research in the U.S. - is both durable and an unquestionable market leader.After a strong Q2 print (well, a more accurate phrase would be ""far stronger than feared""), shares of Zillow have rocketed up near new all-time highs:Prior to the release of Zillow's Q2 results, we were in the dark as to when (and whether) Zillow's fundamentals would recover within the year. Now, we know through Zillow's guidance that the company is expecting a rebound as quickly as in Q3. There's a lot to like about Zillow exiting Q2, and we think the bullish thesis for this company is very much still intact. The key points of the bullish thesis are below:The bottom line here: don't underestimate Zillow. Investors have flocked to many social media/e-commerce stocks for their large and growing user bases and as beneficiaries of the coronavirus, but when you look beyond the immediate term, more and more people are also ditching traditional real estate and moving their home-buying activities online. Zillow is leading the charge in that trend. Stay long here. Let's now discuss Zillow's second-quarter results in greater detail, starting with the company's core IMT (internet, media, and technology) segment - which is Zillow's core segment generating revenue from real estate agents.To frame some context around these results, we were already expecting Q2 to be bad. Zillow had noted that a sharp slowdown in real estate activity in the March-April timeframe had really impacted the Premier Agent business in April. In addition to the macro slowdown, Zillow also kicked off a program called #BetterTogether that provided billings discounts to its Premier Agent partners (effectively sharing in the pain caused by the slowdown in real estate activity, but with the hope of retaining those agents post-pandemic), and this program also had a negative impact on revenue. We were hoping, however, that the interest rate cuts that began in May would help to drive a rebound in real estate activity.Figure 1. Zillow IMT segment resultsSource: Zillow Q2 shareholder letterZillow's total IMT revenue declined -13% y/y to $280 million; as seen in the chart above, while Premier Agent revenues (the bulk of the IMT segment) declined -17% y/y to $192 million. This was far better than Zillow's initial guidance for a -27% y/y decline - indicating that the May/June recovery period was stronger than anticipated. We find it meaningful to highlight as well the fact that moderated headcount growth and disciplined spend has led to a ~6 point increase in Adjusted EBITDA margins.Zillow is also pointing to a much better Q3, including a return to growth. The company is forecasting $369-$384 million in revenue, representing 10-15% y/y growth, while Premier Agent is expected to be $272-$282 million, representing 13-17% y/y growth. Figure 2. Zillow guidance updateSource: Zillow Q2 shareholder letterNote that pre-coronavirus, Zillow's Q4 Premier Agent revenue growth was only 6% y/y. This seems to suggest that Zillow is emerging from the pandemic in a stronger position than it entered. Here's some context on the outlook from CFO Allen Parker during the Q2 earnings call:And although this quarter's results are less meaningful due to Zillow Offers only restarting partially midway through the quarter, it's useful as well to touch on the performance of the Homes segment in Q2.Zillow restarted purchasing homes only in May, though the company did sell homes throughout the quarter - and the 1,437 homes sold and $453.8 million in revenue came in above the company's expectations. Also important to note is that Zillow sold through 80% of the inventory that it had on hand at the beginning of Q2, proving the company's ability to move houses off the balance sheet relatively quickly.Figure 3. Zillow Homes segment resultsSource: Zillow Q2 shareholder letterThe main metrics to watch for here are on the profitability side. The company's per-home profitability suffered slightly this quarter, with a loss of $2,800 per home (89bps) below last quarter's slight 4bps profit per home. The primary driver behind this, however, is the fact that Zillow paused home-buying for parts of Q1 and Q2 - meaning that Zillow's home sales mostly worked off older inventory, which carries lower returns per home. This is a headwind that should fade in Q3, with restarted purchases of new homes leading to higher margins.Real estate is one of the last industries that is ripe for transformation by technology. Zillow already has a strong pull on consumers, and the pandemic has driven more traffic to its site and gotten more people used to both researching and executing real estate transactions online. I'm particularly encouraged by Zillow's guidance of getting Premier Agent revenues to grow above pre-pandemic rates. Stay long here."
4372106,104716,2020-09-02T10:24:53-04:00,"I value Zillow's three business segments for a combined $20/per share.Homes, its house-flipping business is worth $0 per share at best.I believe the Mortgage segment is also worth $0.Zillow Media, its real estate web site, is a real business that I believe is worth $20 per share.I have a strong sell rating on Zillow.","Zillow is truly a magical stock. It has doubled this year, and tripled off its bottom. And why not? Zillow lost money the last five years, but Wall Street analysts (Yahoo Finance) expect…another loss this year (-$0.40) and another loss next year (-$0.13). Yes, Zillow could beat these estimates and break even or eke out a small profit. But even Zillow’s most ardent supporters can’t argue that this year’s rally is due to near-term earnings.Yes, Zillow is a magical stock in a magical investment environment. A time when a strong internet presence – and yes, Zillow has that – is enough to let investors dream big dreams.But the fact is that those ultimately dreams have to be about earnings, however far in the future. Owning a stock is owning a piece of a company, and the reason you and I like owning pieces of a company are that we share in its earnings stream. So this, my second report on Zillow (the first was Zillow: The Stock Is A Zell) returns to the question of whether Zillow’s three businesses can generate sufficient profits over the long run to justify its current price of $87, no less a higher price. My conclusion is again is that the prospect is quite slim indeed. I therefore reiterate my zell – sorry, sell – call on Zillow. And not just a ""somewhat overpriced"" sell. My target price is a dazzling 77% below its current price. Magical times create some fantastical creatures.For newbies to the stock, a quick review of those three businesses:· Homes, which buys and flips homes.· Mortgages, which originates home mortgage loans.· Zillow Media (my name), which refers prospective homebuyers and renters who visit its web site to realtors for a fee.Let’s check out their potential stock market value.Here are Homes’ financial statements since it got going in earnest in 2019:Source: Zillow financial reportsThree data points stand out like sore thumbs:1. $490 million of losses in just six quarters! Big losses today must mean big profits down the road, right?2. The gross margin is awfully narrow. The gross margin represents, to the best of my understanding, the sale price Zillow achieves, less (A) the purchase price, (B) needed repairs/renovations and (C) the interest carry on the home while in inventory.3. Overhead costs seem very high. Why does it take roughly $400 million a year to buy and flip?It looks to me that Zillow Homes will certainly lose money for the next few years. Can it ever break even, no less make the massive amounts of money the stock price implies? Unlikely, because of gross margin challenges.Somehow Zillow needs to buy cheaper or sell dearer. But the more likely outcome is narrower margins. More competition brings lower profits. There are already over 80,000 realtor organizations whose job it is to increase the pool of buyers. The rise of “iBuyers” adds to the competition. iBuyers include bigger names like Zillow, Redfin, Opendoor and Offerpad. But the ads on a Google search also popped up Prestige Home Buyers, WeBuyHouse, Fast Cash for Your Home, Upnest, Clark and Homelight. There are even services to help you choose the right iBuyer! All of these new competitors threatens profit margins.Could the one-click appeal of iBuying be so compelling that a large number of home sellers will accept thousands of dollars less in sale proceeds and give that money to the iBuyer? I will defend the millennials to say that only a few will be so careless with their finances.Net/net, I cannot see how Homes adds to Zillow’s stock value. Give it a $0. It should surely generate losses for the foreseeable future, in my opinion. And the likelihood of compressing gross margins suggests that even if Zillow can bring this business to profitability, it will be modest. As likely is the possibility that Zillow will shut Homes down at some point.This table compares Zillow Mortgage’s profits since inception with national loan origination volume:Sources: Zillow, Fannie MaeAnother money losing business to date, although a piker at $58 million of cumulative losses compared to Homes’ $490 million. Mortgage lending is fiercely competitive, and subject to severe cyclical risks. Look at the national loan origination numbers in the table and you can see the volatility. Home sales are seasonal, peaking during Q2 and Q3. And refinancings are wildly cyclical based on interest rate changes.The drastic decline in interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve this year obviously set off a refinancing boom. Fannie Mae believes the boom peaked during the June quarter. Within 6-9 months after a mortgage rate drop, the great bulk of homeowners seeking to refinance at that rate will have done so. Fannie Mae’s therefore expects refinance volume to decline this quarter and next quarter. The next refinancing wave may be a long way off. The 10-year Treasury rate is down to 0.7%. Yes, it can go lower, but not by much.This scenario is nasty for the mortgage origination business. Following the last four refinance booms, origination volume declined on average by about 40%. This one should be no different. The sudden excess loan processing capacity in each prior case caused significant losses and widespread bankruptcies. Again this time will likely be no different.Circling back to Zillow, its mortgage businesses managed to only break even during possibly the last big refi boom in a generation. This Q3 it may even turn a small profit. But after that? Duck.Finally, an interesting data point. When smart businesspeople are selling, smart investors are selling too, not buying. In the mortgage business, nobody has done better than Rocket Mortgage (also called Quicken Loans). I will put their management team up against any in the US. Rocket successfully navigated through the Great Recession and four refinance cycles, all along taking share from the country’s biggest banks, all as a private company. Yet a few weeks ago Rocket went public. Management is selling. Do you want to buy as a Zillow shareholder?I don’t. I value Zillow Mortgage at $0. After a tough decade, Zillow Media is now a real business earning real money. But the business has its limits. Zillow Media earns it money as an advertising outlet for real estate brokers, primarily for home sales. As such, Zillow Media is ultimately limited by realtors’ ad spend, which in turn is limited by realtors’ commissions, which in turn is limited by home sales. A present value model for Zillow makes assumptions for those three items, as well as Zillow’s market share of the ad spend, its profit margin and a discount rate to present value future income. This table shows those numbers for 2019, my estimates for 2025 and then any assumed changes beyond 2025:The home sales growth rate assumes a 1% annual increase in the housing stock, 3% home price appreciation per year and a steady rate of turnover of homes.The average realtor’s commission of 4.5% is about the current rate, but competition created by the internet is likely to reduce that level over time. So I’m being friendly here.The average realtor marketing spend of 6% is about what industry leader Realogy spends.Zillow’s market share is Zillow Media’s revenues from home sales (excludes apartment rentals) as a percent of the estimated realtor marketing spend. By this measure Zillow Media’s share increased from 14% in 2015 to 25% this year.The profit margin is Zillow Media’s after-tax profits as a percent of total revenues. Note that Facebook’s most recent profit margin was 28%, so I give Zillow Media full credit for success.The discount rate of 10% is relatively low, suggesting strong confidence that Zillow will deliver on the above assumptions.Popping these assumptions into Excel’s net present value generates a $20 per share value. That’s it. Could I get $30 with more optimistic assumptions. It’s nearly impossible.So far I've got $0 + $0 + $20 = $20. Excel also tells me that Zillow’s current stock price of $87 is more than $20. Zell. Or sell. This is a seriously overpriced stock.But how did Zillow get to $87? Is there a non-magical forecast of net present value per share (NPV) that makes any sense? If Zillow Media grows its market share by 7% a year rather than my assumed 2%, then it will own 100% of the realtor marketing budget in ten years. That still only gets my valuation for Media to $35 a share, but we're closer, right?Mortgage is just too small and farfetched to generate material value. So it's up to Zillow Homes. If Zillow Homes:All of these rosy scenarios add - are you sitting? - $4 per share in NPV! So we need far more serious fantasizing. Ready? Let's do it:Even with two seriously unlikely events - Zillow Media captures a 100% market share and Zillow Homes extracts far more money from home buyers/sellers than they pay at present - I still only get $65 per share! We need more. Zillow Streaming? Zillow Motors? Zillow toothpaste? I'll leave this fantasizing to you. I'm tired. And selling."
4375477,105842,2020-09-21T11:28:00-04:00,"Most people’s reaction to a company like Opendoor is, “Cool idea. Won’t actually work.”.At least one person sees the vision. Last Tuesday, Chamath Palihapitiya announced that his SPAC, Social Capital Hedosophia II (IPOB) is merging with Opendoor to take it public at a $4.8 billion valuation.The more I dig into Opendoor, the more bullish I get.","It’s hard to avoid SPACs. Everyone has one, Nikola (NKLA) is looking more and more like a fraud, and Chamath just launched three more. It’s easy to dismiss SPACs as a fad and the companies that they take public as immature, risky, and dangerous.But great companies can go public via SPAC, too, and they increasingly will. When we find one of those, it’s worth doing our homework, which is what today is all about.Knock Knock. Who’s There? Opendoor.Homes are emotional.Puja and I are having our first kid, a son, in less than a month. We spent this Saturday cleaning up my parents’ house and getting rid of old junk that we hadn’t used for years to make space for all of the new stuff the little guy will need whenever we come visit. As with any cleaning project, we started by emptying one closet and decided to throw out twenty-plus years’ worth of trash and memories from around the house. As we emptied closets we hadn’t opened in years, my mom came up with reasons we should keep that old empty picture frame or half-used can of WD-40, told us that we should just dry clean the sleeping bag we bought in 1998 in case we might want to use it at some point in the future. None of it is rational, but it’s not unique either. Mari Kondo has made a fortune convincing people to let go of things that once held importance but no longer do.And that’s just the stuff. You would have to pry us out of the house itself.Maybe that’s why housing is one of the last major categories that technology has left alone. Sure, companies have tried. Tons of them. The startup graveyard is filled with companies led by entrepreneurs who realized that the way we buy and sell homes sucks, but couldn’t ultimately figure out how to change it. They weren’t thinking big or long-term enough. The companies that have made the biggest impact, like Zillow (Z) and Redfin (RDFN), make it easier to search for houses, but then kick buyers over to agents to go through the offline process, the same way it’s always been done.There’s this Startup Lindy Effect at play in real estate. If the future life expectancy of something is proportional to its current age, and real estate has survived practically unchanged by technology longer than any other industry, then maybe the way it is is the best we can do.That’s why most people’s reaction to a company like Opendoor is, “Cool idea. Won’t actually work.”Opendoor, founded in 2013, lets people transact real estate at the click of a button. It promises to transform a process that has traditionally been “Complex, Uncertain, and Slow” into one that is “Simple, Certain, and Fast” by using technology to make instant offers on homes.At least one person sees the vision. Last Tuesday, Chamath Palihapitiya announced that his SPAC, Social Capital Hedosophia II (IPOB) is merging with Opendoor to take it public at a $4.8 billion valuation.(For a refresher on how SPACs work, check out Juul: The SPAC 2020 Deserves.)So now, without the months of preparation and detailed S-1 that the traditional IPO offers, the question shifts from, “Could Opendoor work?” to “Should I invest in Opendoor?”My gut reaction to that question was a resounding “NO.” There are three things that companies say that make me want to run away as fast as I can:Opendoor says ALL THREE of those things.Plus, Opendoor faces opposition from the realtors who still control the vast majority of the housing market and competition from Zillow (Z), a company I respect tremendously that has a massive demand generation advantage. PLUS, Opendoor is a well-funded, SoftBank-backed (OTCPK:SFTBY) real estate company, like, you know, WeWork (WE). The New York Times wrote about Opendoor in 2017 and titled the article “The Rise of the Fat Start-Up.” If asset light is in, Opendoor should be out.And yet… the more I dig into Opendoor, the more bullish I get.I think Opendoor at $4.8 billion will be one of those prices people look back at in a couple years and say, “Shit, I was thinking about buying Opendoor when its market cap was like $5 billion and I missed out,” because the things that most companies say about themselves are true for Opendoor.Amazon didn’t win because it was the first company to sell things on the internet or because it controlled demand. Amazon won because it resiliently put all the expensive and unsexy pieces in place and sacrificed short-term profitability for long-term dominance. Before Marc Andreessen yelled it, Jeff Bezos realized that Amazon had to BUILD.Opendoor is doing the same thing in real estate. Real estate hasn’t been impervious to startups because it’s structurally immovable. It’s just really hard to change, capital intensive, and slow relative to another B2B SaaS business. No one has taken the vertically integrated approach and long view that Opendoor has. Opendoor built the world’s most accurate home pricing model, operates a distributed network of thousands of inspectors and contractors, regularly accesses both the debt and equity capital markets, takes inventory risk, and coordinates among the many parties involved in the home selling transaction. It consciously decided to take on a ton of risk.But as Ben Thompson wrote in Opendoor: A Startup Worth Emulating in 2016:Being aware of, comfortable with, and prepared for risk is a major advantage. Opendoor laid out its plan from the beginning, identified the key risks, and has spent the last six years eliminating the downside and building structural advantages that increase its upside potential.It’s difficult to understand the compounding effect of all of the little things that Opendoor does, and why those little things will give the company such a large advantage over competitors. People grasp its downside much better than they grasp its upside. But grasping the upside is what we’re all about here at Not Boring, so here it is:Investing in Opendoor today is an opportunity to get in before the rest of the world catches up to something that Opendoor’s founders saw way back in 2003.Opendoor had the benefit of perfect timing, but it wasn’t luck. It was an idea waiting for just the right moment.On This Week in Startups in 2018, Opendoor co-founder, Keith Rabois told host Jason Calacanis:Around the same time Thiel asked Rabois for a real estate idea, Eric Wu was having a similarly painful homebuying experience in Arizona. When he was 19 and a student at the University of Arizona, Wu used scholarship funds to purchase his first house, a $112k fixer upper. Wu felt the same pain that Rabois did:It’s not surprising that Rabois and Wu had similarly horrible experiences. Selling a home is universally painful. One in four people would rather attend a funeral than go through the process of selling a home.But unlike the millions of people who have had similarly rough experiences, Rabois actually tried to start a company to fix the problem and bring liquidity to the housing market. He went searching for $10 million for project “Homerun,” but was only able to secure $5 million. He realized that it had to be all or nothing, so he dropped it, but spent the better part of the next decade biding his time and trying to convince someone to build it with him.Then in 2010, Wu joined Y Combinator with his real estate startup and sought Rabois out as an adviser. At their first meeting, Keith tried to convince Eric to drop his idea, Movity, which provided location-based data to help home buyers make better decisions, and build Homerun with him. Wu turned him down and stuck with Movity (Rabois invested) and sold to Trulia in December 2010.After two years at Trulia, Rabois tried to woo Wu again. This time, he succeeded. A decade later, it was time to turn his idea into a reality.In 2013, Wu built a landing page, opendoorrealty.co, to test whether people would be willing to instantly sell their homes at a discount. Wu told the audience at NFX’s 2019 Proptech Summit that he discovered that there is “a significant liquidity premium for a certain set of sellers.” He talked to ten sellers, and asked whether they would be willing to sell their home for 88 cents on the dollar. Some said yes, and for those who didn’t, he worked his way up until he found an equilibrium. Assessing the opportunity based on price elasticity of the demand curves is in the company’s DNA, and that’s really important. We’ll come back to why a little later.Rabois, then a partner at Khosla Ventures, committed to lead a $10 million Series A for the renamed Opendoor, with Wu at the helm as CEO. At the time, $10 million was a big first check, but both men understood that they couldn’t MVP their way into transforming residential real estate. They needed to do it right from the beginning. Part of doing it right meant recruiting a founding team with necessary experience:In its founding team, Opendoor had the real estate, pricing, product, and capital markets expertise necessary to make housing liquid.With the team in place, Opendoor closed its Series A, led by Khosla, in July 2014. Incredibly, its Series A deck laid out most of the plan that Opendoor is still executing on today.Here’s how it works:Rabois and Wu started the company on the belief that certain customers would be willing to pay a premium for certainty, and that many more customers would take certainty for free. Simply put, the strategy that Opendoor has pursued since day one is:Start with the least price sensitive customers → use them to improve accuracy and lower costs → attract slightly more price sensitive customers → use them to improve accuracy and lower costs → launch new markets with least price sensitive customers → rinse, wash, repeatThis is the first point at which Opendoor starts to remind you of Amazon. In Two Ways to Predict the Future, I wrote that Jeff Bezos had a strong claim for the G.W.O.A.T. (Greatest Worldbuilder of All Time) crown because he saw that everything would be sold online in the future and set out to patiently execute on his long-term vision. While Bezos started with books, which the internet with its infinite shelf space was uniquely positioned to handle, Rabois and Wu started with homes, which the internet has been notoriously bad at handling.As Byrne Hobart pointed out, “Homes may be the single most heterogeneous asset class and product in existence. There are 95m single-family homes in the US, all of which are in some way unique.” So Rabois and Wu picked the most homogenous product within the universe of US residential real estate: newly constructed homes in Phoenix.It’s important to keep in mind how systematic Opendoor has been throughout its life. The Series A deck highlighted three risks -- model accuracy, buying overvalued homes, and capital -- and used its Series A and Phoenix to address each. It used subsequent rounds to de-risk, scale, expand, acquire, and drive down costs. Remove friction, improve margins.For a full history, including links to fundraising articles, check out this Google doc.By the time it raised its last venture round in March 2019, less than five years since it raised its Series A, Opendoor accomplished a lot:In 2019 alone, Opendoor did $4.7 billion in revenue with positive contribution margins. All of that capital, including SoftBank money, which has often been a kiss of death for its recipients, made Opendoor stronger. Opendoor’s strategy had always involved launching markets, proving and improving the model, de-risking, and launching new markets. Whereas SoftBank money forced companies like Wag to expand before they were ready, Opendoor knew exactly when it was ready to expand and what it wanted to accomplish by doing so. Its focus on unit economics meant that it wouldn’t light the money on fire, and a strong balance sheet meant that it was ready for turbulence.When the Coronavirus hit, Opendoor was prepared. It dramatically de-risked, laying off over 600 employees (35% of staff), paused buying while continuing to sell, and brought its home inventory down from $1 billion to $172 million. CFO Carrie Wheeler pointed out that it sold down without sacrificing margins, which dipped just slightly from 7.1% in Q1 to 6.8% in Q2.Then in the midst of the pandemic, some good news. Last week, after a week of rumors, Chamath announced that his second SPAC, IPOB, was merging with Opendoor to go public at a $4.8 billion valuation.Chamath is the voice of the SPAC movement, and CNBC is his pulpit. Last Tuesday, he went on CNBC to lay out his thesis for Opendoor:Residential real estate is a massive market ($1.6 trillion annually) with low customer satisfaction and an inconsistent experience (28% of realtors do the job part time). Opendoor’s model has five tailwinds at its back:The former Facebook exec and Social Capital CEO has high hopes for the company:After a run-up to $18, IPOB closed the week at $14.60. A healthy run-up, but nothing like high-margin tech IPOs like Snowflake, which more than doubled on its first day of trading.That makes sense, though. With both SPACs and IPOs on the table as viable options, IPOs are for easily-understood companies, and SPACs are for companies whose potential is underappreciated.Opendoor is underappreciated.Chamath clearly appreciates Opendoor’s vision, but there are many who remain skeptical. Here’s the bear case:I understand where the bears are coming from. At first glance, Opendoor smells too much like WeWork. And a first glance is all some people will give it, because understanding a business like Opendoor’s can seem opaque and unapproachable, particularly with phrases like SPAC and iBuying in the mix. But it ultimately comes down to one question, which is the same question you need to answer for any business:Will the company be able to generate positive and growing cash flows for a long time? That one question breaks down into three sub-questions:That’s pretty much it. So how does Opendoor do on each?1. Is the market big enough? This is an easy one. Real estate is massive. According to Zillow’s research, the total value of US homes is $33.6 trillion. Much of that value is locked up because people don’t sell their homes every year, but according to Opendoor, 5 million homes are sold annually, representing $1.6 trillion per year in volume. That’s twice as big as the used auto market (Carvana (CVNA) has a $28 billion market cap) and 60% more than Americans spend on food (Domino’s (DPZ) alone has a $15 billion market cap).Ok got it, housing is big. No one disagrees that housing is big. But how about iBuying? No one’s actually going to sell their home through an app, right? Wrong.In Phoenix, Opendoor’s most mature market, it already has over 4% market share of all home sales. And the company is growing market share faster in its new cohorts. After 12 months, Phoenix only had 0.8% market share. Its last 15 markets got to 1.3% market share within the first year.As Opendoor gains awareness in new markets, it grows, and as it improves its playbook and gains national recognition, it’s able to scale up more quickly. The company and its new partner, Chamath, believe that if it just executes on this playbook across the country, it can achieve $50 billion in run-rate revenue with 4% market share in 100 markets.Ok ok fine, iBuying is a big opportunity. But anyone with a lot of money can just buy a lot of houses. Can they actually make money?2. Does the company make money on each transaction? Can it become profitable?iBuying is a low margin business, but Opendoor has positive unit economics. In Phoenix, it generates a 4% contribution margin (NYSE:CM) on each home, and 3% after paying interest (CMAI) on the money it uses to buy the home. Because the total transaction value is high, that low margin percentage is actually a lot of dollars. It makes $8k per home after interest in Phoenix.Across all markets, it generates a CM of 3.1% and a 1.9% CMAI. It expects those numbers to improve to 5.5% and 4.7% in 2023, respectively. That seems like a small improvement, but at the scale Opendoor anticipates by 2023, every 1% in CMAI improvement is another $100 million that drops to the bottom line, and at a 20x P/E multiple (CarMax is at 21.4x), each 1% represents $2 billion in market cap.Long-term, Opendoor is targeting a 6-8% CMAI as it improves pricing, lowers costs, and adds on high-margin services like title and escrow (82% of customers use Opendoor title & escrow), mortgages, warranties, insurance, and moving. Forbes called title insurance America’s Richest Insurance Racket, because of “antiquated state laws that thwart new competition, allow prices to soar despite declining costs and force almost every home buyer to pay for insurance that most of them will never need.” Opendoor’s purchase of OS National means that it gets to participate in that racket with a captive audience of sellers.When considering additional services, Opendoor’s targets actually seem conservative. The more additional services it attaches, the higher its margins or the lower its price, which would lead to more demand and ultimately higher margins.How about a downturn, though?Even during the Coronavirus-induced selldown, Opendoor was able to maintain positive margins. In A Skeptical Look at Opendoor, though, Twin Oaks Group points out that it’s “inappropriate to portray Covid as a stress on the single family market when indeed it’s a tailwind.” The author noted that home prices actually increased by 1% in the quarter, and by removing that, Opendoor only saw contribution margins of 2.1% and 0.9% after interest.Fair, Opendoor has yet to face a real downturn, but it’s actually better positioned than competitors or individual home sellers if it does, for a few reasons:Ultimately, though, no two downturns are the same. This is a risk to keep an eye on, but I think it’s overblown. Nothing makes me more excited than an overblown bear case.3. Is the company’s advantage defensible in the face of competition?So if a bear market doesn’t take Opendoor down, what about competitors? Opendoor faces increasing competition from both startups and bigger incumbents in the iBuying market.On the startup side, it faces competition from companies like OfferPad, Orchard, and Knock, as well as a host of regional players. This is where Capital as a Moat comes in. More specifically, Opendoor takes advantage of Cost-of-Capital as a Moat. Because of its track record, short durations, balance sheet, and team, it is able to secure the lowest rates of any iBuyer. That means that all else equal, it can make more money on each transaction than any of its competitors, or put another way, it can charge customers less and still make the same margin. But all else is not equal. Opendoor’s data, algorithm, and scale mean that it can price more accurately than its competitors and remodel at lower costs for a higher ROI. No startup will unseat Opendoor or put much of a dent in its plans.Where it gets really interesting is in the head-to-head battle with Zillow Offers.In April 2018, after Opendoor had been buying houses for four years, Zillow announced the launch of its own iBuying program. Instead of choosing markets in which Opendoor doesn’t have a presence, Zillow chose to compete head-to head. Each company buys homes in twelve states, but each only has one state that the other isn’t in (Zillow in Ohio and Opendoor in Utah).I’ve been long Zillow since their stock tanked on the Offers announcement in part because I thought that their core product and Zestimate gave them a distinct demand advantage over Opendoor or any other iBuyer. I’m up 142% on Zillow and holding, but I actually think the advantage in iBuying belongs to Opendoor. Here’s why.Running an operationally-intensive business is just so much different than running a pure tech company. I can’t think of any company that has turned an advantage in SEO into a leading vertically-integrated business. Yelp (YELP) didn’t win food delivery, Kayak didn’t launch Airbnb (AIRB), and Google Shopping (GOOG) hasn’t put a dent in Amazon’s dominance.Opendoor was built from the ground up to do what it does. It has a culture that’s fixated on driving down costs and passing them on to customers. It’s hard to imagine that a company used to software margins can transform its culture without a tremendous amount of pain.In addition to its culture, Opendoor has a bunch of structural advantages built into its DNA that Zillow will struggle to compete with:Zillow undeniably has an advantage in top of funnel demand generation over Opendoor. It’s why I’ve been so bullish. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that that doesn’t matter in iBuying.These advantages become clear when comparing the two companies’ unit economics. According to iBuying expert Mike DelPrete, Zillow operates its iBuying program at a -2% net margin, while Opendoor operates at a 3.1% margin. Two slides in his 2020 iBuyer Report Preview highlight Opendoor’s structural advantages.Worryingly for Zillow, its loss per home increased throughout 2019. It does not seem to be improving efficiency with scale, and it will be interesting to see how long investors let it compete with Opendoor instead of partnering with it.So Opendoor passes all three tests: it’s the leader in a massive market with a clear path to growing profits and has moats that protects its margins from competitors.The advantages that Opendoor has over its competitors are also why I think that the company has a legitimate claim at comparing itself to Amazon.At this point, we’ve established that Opendoor has the potential to be a great business in an enormous market practically untouched by innovation. The thing that gets me most excited about the company, though, is how similar it is to Amazon.Many of the skeptics’ concerns that I highlighted above are the same concerns that Jeff Bezos once heard. It’s a low margin business. It just keeps losing money. It’s so capital intensive. eBay (EBAY) has a better business model and lower costs; it will eat Amazon’s lunch. Most people won’t want to shop online, anyway.The criticisms aren’t the only similarities between the two companies. Amazon and Opendoor are similar in four ways:Customer ObsessionCustomer Obsession is the leadership principle that Bezos credits most for Amazon’s success. Because Amazon is customer obsessed, it’s now fashionable for companies to say that they’re customer obsessed, too. But few live up to it like Opendoor does.Everything that Opendoor does is designed to remove friction, lower prices, and create a better experience for customers. As one example, when asked why he would partner with a competitor like Redfin, Wu said,Choice and experience is one part of the customer obsession, but for such a large transaction, nothing is more important to customers than price. In the same interview, Wu said, “If you make the process cheaper and more efficient, the customer benefits.” The company’s employees are willing to make sacrifices to make that happen.Culture of FrugalityIn Amazon’s early days, instead of buying desks for each new employee, everyone, including Bezos, made their own desks out of doors and 2x4’s. Bezos instilled a culture in which people realized that every penny they didn’t spend on themselves, they could pass on as savings to customers.Opendoor is Amazon’s spiritual frugality successor, and it has the best core value I’ve ever come across to back it up: bps for breakfast. The value means that employees need to always be on the lookout for ways to cut basis points (bps) from its costs, because the lower the company’s costs, the lower prices it can charge customers.Wu brought in Amazon executives to help instill that culture. Its President of Homes & Services, Julie Todaro, was the VP of Operations at Amazon. In 2019, the company added Jason Kilar, who held a variety of leadership roles at Amazon, to its board.He’s also made the hard choices to instill frugality into the company’s culture.Early in COVID, Opendoor laid off 35% of its staff. Critics saw the move as another example of an overfunded, SoftBank-backed company getting over its skis. But given Opendoor’s bps for breakfast culture, I think Wu saw it as an opportunity to get Opendoor’s org structure right.From 2018 to 2020, Opendoor increased the percentage of fully-automated offers made from 41% to 63%, meaning that algorithms could now do the jobs that humans did before. It’s hard to tell someone they’ve been replaced by an algorithm; COVID made it easier.Control Over ProfitabilityA tight grip on costs and deep understanding of the customer gives Opendoor more control over its profitability.Just like Amazon in the early days, I think that most people are missing Opendoor’s massive potential by focusing on its current low margins and lack of profitability. While every money-losing company claims to be like Amazon, this chart from Opendoor’s investor presentation convinced me that it actually is:The chart shows the price elasticity of demand for sellers on the Opendoor platform. When Opendoor charges a 6% fee, sellers convert at 44%. When it charges 10%, sellers convert at 23%. Understanding this curve and how it changes by market, price point, and over time is key to understanding that Opendoor can choose whether it wants to grow faster or be more profitable.This has always been the huge difference between Amazon and the money-burning companies that compare themselves to Amazon: Amazon chooses how profitable it is today to maximize its potential tomorrow, whereas other companies just lose money today and will likely lose money tomorrow. Opendoor chooses to make less money today in order to make more tomorrow. Take Phoenix as an example, where Opendoor has an Adjusted Gross Margin of 7.3%. Based on the chart above, that means it’s converting somewhere near 36%. If it decided to slow growth by a third, from 35% to 23%, Opendoor could generate an additional 2.7% in contribution margin, increasing CM from 4.0% to 6.7%.There’s another vector to consider, too. By growing faster, Opendoor is able to do more volume on both its labor (inspectors and contractors) and materials (it laid over 1 million square feet of carpet last year), driving down those costs. It makes sense for Opendoor to give up some short-term contribution margin today in order to drive down costs, which will allow it to lower prices and generate more demand tomorrow, which will... Wait a second…Amazon and Opendoor’s FlywheelsAmazon and Opendoor obsess over customers and sacrifice comforts to pass on savings to customers not because they’re altruistic, but because doing so creates flywheels that lead to large and growing advantages.Amazon’s flywheel is famous. It focused on the customer experience because having the best customer experience drives traffic to Amazon, which allows it to attract more sellers, which means more choice, and a better customer experience, which leads to more growth. More growth and a culture of frugality mean a lower cost structure, which means lower prices, which also leads to a better customer experience. Once the wheel starts turning, it just keeps building on itself, and Amazon runs further and further ahead of its competition.Opendoor has a similar flywheel to Amazon, which Chamath highlighted both on CNBC and in the investor presentation.As he explains it:The more Opendoor continues to execute on its playbook -- the more offers it makes, the lower costs it drives, the better it prices homes -- the further ahead it gets. This flywheel will allow Opendoor to both win against existing competitors and expand iBuying market share as the costs to customers drive down to levels below what they’re paying in the traditional process today.Just like you couldn’t have predicted AWS by looking at Amazon in 2000, it’s hard to predict what Opendoor might look at in twenty years. But that doesn’t mean we can’t try.Short-term, its plan is obvious because it’s the same one it’s been running for six years: Opendoor will continue to execute on the flywheel by expanding into more markets, lowering costs, and attaching more additional services.To understand whether Opendoor is succeeding against its plan in the short-term, watch its contribution margins. After it’s officially public, it will have to report earnings every quarter, and contribution margins will be the first thing I look for.Medium-term, Opendoor will add services beyond the home sale transaction. It has announced plans for moving, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it started offering ongoing home repairs and maintenance, painting, lawn care, cleaning, and anything else related to the home that does one or more of three things:Long-term, it can achieve its vision of providing real liquidity to the housing market. Imagine a world in which it’s easier to buy a home than it is to rent. Opendoor could provide low transaction costs, fast turnaround times, easy moves, recommended houses, and more. Opendoor can increase its addressable market by increasing the velocity of home transactions and enable the currently-unattainable combination of home ownership and flexibility.It might also flex its capital markets muscle and unique position in the real estate value chain to create a financial asset that gives investors exposure to city indices, either by syndicating out the equity it holds on its balance sheet or by giving buyers a new form of equity-based financing. I love New York, but I’d love some exposure to markets like Philadelphia, Austin, and Denver right now. Opendoor is best positioned to make my dream come true.Technology has fundamentally transformed every industry except real estate. Opendoor is changing that. When it does, it could be as big as Amazon… if Amazon doesn’t buy it first.Big thanks to KiDKapital for all of the incredible Opendoor and iBuying information, and to Dan and Puja for editing what started as my longest draft ever. They saved you.Disclaimer: This is not investment advice! I have no idea if the stock will go up or down in the short, medium, or long-term. This is just my analysis of Opendoor’s strategy and opportunity. I own a small amount of IPOB and plan on adding more.Thanks for reading, and see you on Public,PackyLink to original article"
4349228,105526,2020-05-21T07:12:44-04:00,"Zillow's Q1 results surprise to the upside, in stark contrast to the late-March update.Positive April trends bode well for a pending recovery.But at 2-3x EV/Revenue, I question if investors are paying too steep a price.","Following a bleak March update that saw management preparing the balance sheet for a 12-month downdraft, Zillow's (Z) latest quarter was a welcome surprise. Not only was there a near-term resumption of the home buying program, but the Premier Agent (PA) business also experienced a lower-than-expected impact through COVID-19. In sum, the positive Q1 results leave me sanguine about recovery at Zillow, however, valuations are a key consideration. At a c. 3x EV/Revenue multiple in a recession, along with continued losses in Homes, the positivity has likely been priced in. At the current lofty valuation, any negative macro data points could result in severe downside to Zillow shares.Zillow's Q1 was surprisingly positive, beating consensus across all metrics, including each revenue segment and adjusted EBITDA. The revenue growth trajectory in IMT remains very impressive at +499% Y/Y, with IMT revenue (+11% Y/Y) boosting the overall top-line to 148% Y/Y.Source: Zillow 10-QOn an adjusted basis, EBITDA losses at Homes and Mortgages widened, offsetting the encouraging margin expansion story at IMT (+540bps Y/Y). This comes despite the decreased contribution from share-based compensation at IMT for the quarter, which at $30 million, is down c.46% Y/Y.Source: Zillow 10-QImportantly, the meaningful slowdown in mid-March seems to be transitory, as buyer activity is picking up again. According to management on the quarterly call, traffic and connection requests, new listings, and pending sales all saw improvements in late-April.The company is not providing a full-year outlook for now, but Q2 guidance implies a diverging outlook. On the one hand, we are set for softer trends at IMT as temporary discounts are implemented to support real estate agents. On the other hand, we should also see a stronger outlook for Homes, as the company looks to resume home-buying activity within the next few weeks.Interestingly, Zillow's updated stress test scenario (assuming a 75% haircut to pre-COVID-19 revenue for IMT and the Mortgages business repurchases inventory with cash) indicates it is now positioned to end the year with $1.7 billion of cash (up from $1.35 billion prior), should a severe downturn materialize. As of Q1, the company held $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents, excluding short-term investments ($993 million) and restricted cash ($56 million).Source: Company DataIt's important to stress the stark contrast in tone with Zillow's last call on March 23, when management saw visits to Zillow fall c. 20% Y/Y on broad-based virus impacts. Since then, however, traffic and requests on Zillow seem to have made a swift recovery, returning to pre-COVID 19 levels in late April, along with pending sales and new listings.In addition to macro factors, this could also be partly down to management, making the most of a slower market by pulling forward its technology roadmap. For example, the crisis has increased the adoption of 3D tours and other virtual home technologies, as Zillow's software created 525% more 3D home tours in April (compared to February). Additionally, efforts to digitize the rentals market could also serve as a leading indicator for real estate processes such as closing and appraisals, eventually moving online as well.Alongside the traffic uplift, positive commentary from connections such as Realogy (RLGY) (excerpt below) also indicates that consumers shopping in this environment appear to be serious.If these trends persist, and sheltering restrictions begin to lift, this makes Zillow a natural beneficiary of pent-up property demand. The consumer behavioral shift observed by Realogy is a strong ROI opportunity for Zillow, not only because it presents new monetization opportunities, but also because it allows improved measurement and understanding of consumer behavior.Also worth noting is the resilient 11% Y/Y Premier Agent revenue growth in Q1, despite a c. 460 bps headwind from Flex Pricing. Lower Q2 revenue guidance may prove transitory as it mainly reflects the lagging impact of discounts provided to agents beginning late March to help cope with the COVID-19 slowdown. Importantly, these discounts have had an effect; the lower churn had led to a less than 5% decline in monthly recurring revenue in April.Source: Zillow Shareholder LetterLooking beyond Q2, I see PA regaining its upward trajectory as these discounts moderate. A strong underlying housing market, as shown by the traffic growth returning to double-digits across Zillow's properties, should support recovery as pent-up demand drives buyers back into the market.The real highlight was Zillow's traction in Homes, which saw revenue growth of c. 28% sequentially to $770 million, which was above the upper-end of guidance. Importantly, the pace of sales accelerated without sacrificing unit economics, at a time when uncertainty is rife due to the pandemic. The improvement was attributable to Zillow's applied machine learning techniques, which helped Zillow price homes faster and more accurately. Though the Homes segment posted an adj EBITDA loss of $75 million, it was still a c. 400bps sequential margin improvement.Source: Company DataWith iBuying set to resume in the next few weeks, the segment is positioned for a re-acceleration, as management commentary suggests iBuying remains a key part of the long-term Zillow story. The bottom-line remains a concern, though, as Q1 losses remain deep, even if it did improve sequentially. The long-term profitability of the Homes business, however, is still a point of debate. Though management still believes in a 2-3% EBITDA margin (long term), I would note this excludes interest expense and losses on homes, which makes the viability of the segment debatable.Source: Company DataZillow has navigated near-term pressures from COVID-19 well, and with ample liquidity to weather any economic headwinds for the foreseeable future, looks well-positioned. The issue, however, is that the market seems to have already priced in a considerably optimistic view at a c.3x EV/Revenue (vs Realogy at c. 0.9x).Data by YChartsAs the long term EBITDA margin target for Homes at 2-3% EBITDA offers little buffer against uncertainty in the business' outlook, there is plenty of Homes-led downside risk to the Zillow valuation at these levels. In the aftermath of the upbeat Q1 as well, earnings estimates have been revised upward, and consequently, Zillow's multiples could come down should any macro challenges emerge or if traffic sees stronger-than-expected contractions beyond April."
4341516,103480,2020-04-30T11:18:33-04:00,"Zillow shares have shed ~35% from peak values, indicating investors' fears that the coronavirus would derail real estate.Zillow has paused its home-buying program, Zillow Offers. Its current balance sheet has under $900 million of unsold home inventory, less than 10% of its market cap.Prior to the coronavirus, revenue was accelerating in Zillow's core Premier Agent business. Google Trends data show that web traffic has not substantially reduced.Zillow has ample ~$2.3 billion liquidity; its CEO noted that even in a ""stress"" situation the company would end the year with $1.3 billion in cash.","Predictably so, Zillow's (Z) momentum has been de-railed substantially this year. Just when investors were beginning to see a turnaround in the company's core Premier Agent Business in the fourth quarter earnings report in February, and finally getting a degree of comfort around Zillow Offers, the coronavirus hit and sparked tremendous uncertainty in the real estate industry. A recent report by Fannie Mae expects that home sales will likely decline by 15% this year, hurting the real estate agents that provide Zillow with advertising revenues.Correspondingly, shares of Zillow have fallen roughly 35% from peaks reached in February:Data by YChartsIn my view, the sustained dip in Zillow shares presents a timely opportunity to buy a recovering franchise at a discount. I'm not ignoring the fact that 2020 will be a difficult year for Zillow that will likely see hard-earned revenue growth slip into declines, but the bullish thesis for the company rests on two factors:Zillow's CEO has recently published a letter affirming the company's ample liquidity and that the company has sufficient resources to wade through a difficult year. Stay long here as Zillow continues to capture secular tailwinds from the digitization of the real estate industry.Let's start with trends in Zillow's core Premier Agent business (which generates revenue from real estate agents who pay to be featured on Zillow's site next to home listings) prior to the impact of the coronavirus. Zillow's shares peaked in February primarily on news of strong Premier Agent execution. Revenue in this segment grew 6% y/y, accelerating three points from 3% y/y in Q3. In addition, Zillow was originally expecting this business to continue accelerating in 2020, with a pre-coronavirus guidance outlook of 7% y/y growth for Premier Agent revenues.The confidence stems from strong retention trends within Zillow's real estate agent base. Zillow has succeeded in steeply accelerating its monthly recurring revenue from its core agents, accelerating to 12% y/y growth in MRR in Q4, up substantially from just low single-digit growth rates throughout the rest of the year.Figure 1. Zillow Premier Agent MRR trendsSource: Zillow Q4 shareholder letterZillow has also experimented with ""Flex"" pricing in certain markets like Phoenix and Atlanta, which means that real estate agents only pay a success fee to Zillow after they close the deal. Zillow views Flex as a way of lowering the entry barrier to newer agents, and has seen success in this program in the test markets it's rolled out.Zillow's focus on execution and efficiency has driven substantial profit increases in the IMT (Internet, Media and Technology) segment, of which Premier Agent is the biggest contributor alongside Zillow Rentals. In FY19, IMT generated 27% y/y growth in Adjusted EBITDA to $303.9 million, while expanding EBITDA margins by 380bps year-over-year. This margin expansion is key because at the moment, Premier Agent/IMT generates all of Zillow's profits and essentially is subsidizing the Zillow Offers business as it continues to ramp up toward profitability.Figure 2. Zillow IMT business trendsSource: Zillow Q4 shareholder letterOf course, this is all in the past. The world (particularly real estate) has shifted on its axis since the coronavirus began, and as previously mentioned, many institutions and observers are expecting double-digit declines in home sales this year. We do think, however, that the shelter-in-place situation only makes Zillow more prominent and top-of-mind for homebuyers conducting research. Google Trends data also suggests that Zillow's web traffic is either flat or slightly up since the year began. Take a look below:Source: Google TrendsGoogle Trends indexes search volumes on a basis of 0 to 100, with a value of 100 representing the time period with the most active search queries. Zillow's index score at the beginning of the year was 77 - and while it dipped substantially in March to the low 60s, it has rebounded in April to 92 as of last week - suggesting as much as a 20% bump in traffic since the year began. We note as well that in Q4, Zillow reported a 10% y/y increase in monthly average unique users, further solidifying strong traffic growth. Increased traffic, plus the fact that many consumers now have no option but to turn online for home-searching (and may have been introduced to Zillow or its partner sites like Trulia or StreetEasy for the first time), boosts Zillow's value proposition to real estate agents. Though revenues are likely to be down this year as real estate sales sag, Zillow is well-positioned to continue being the dominant advertising platform for real estate agents when the housing market rebounds.We can now turn to Zillow's other primary business, which didn't exist a few years back: Zillow Offers. Zillow Offers and the so-called ""iBuying"" industry has been a lightningrod for criticism for Zillow - and indeed, the company has yet to turn a profit on flipping homes, with Zillow losing roughly $5,000 per home after including all selling expenses as of 2019 (the company plans to earn a profit eventually by trimming holding costs/holding times while gaining scale efficiencies on selling expenses). In March, Zillow announced that it was indefinitely suspending new home purchases - but its existing inventory is at risk.We acknowledge that the biggest risk for Zillow right now is the fact that many homes are going unsold, so Zillow's unsold home inventory will stick on its balance sheet for longer and increase holding costs. We do have to note, however, that Zillow Offers isn't that large in relation to Zillow as a whole.As of the end of December, Zillow had $836.6 million of unsold home inventory on its balance sheet. While that's not a small number, it's less than a tenth of Zillow's current ~$9 billion market cap, and counterbalanced by the $2.42 billion of cash that Zillow holds on its balance sheet.Figure 3. Zillow December balance sheetSource: Zillow 10-KWe also want to reinforce that while holding costs for Zillow will increase as real estate sales slow, the value of its inventory is unlikely to degrade by much, especially as the latest Case-Shiller data through the end of February continues to show house price gains across the U.S. driven by limited supply.It's also important to note that in spite of nearly $1 billion in unsold home inventory, Zillow's ~$2.4 billion of cash keeps it highly liquid. Zillow's core business trends toward being cash flow neutral. Last year, Zillow generated a -$612.7 million loss in operating cash flows - but if we exclude the $673.8 million of investment that Zillow made into its home inventory, OCF would have been positive. Inventory will not continue to grow throughout the coronavirus crisis as Zillow has paused its home-buying, minimizing its burn rates.Figure 4. Zillow cash flowsSource: Zillow 10-KThe company has also implemented efforts to reduce non-Zillow Offers operating costs. By freezing hiring, cutting advertising spend, and slashing other discretionary spending, Zillow intends to reduce its operating costs by ~25%, translating to roughly $400 million in annual operating cost savings based on FY19 operating expenses of $1.56 billion.Figure 5. Zillow savings effortsSource: Zillow CEO letterThis gives us a high degree of confidence in Zillow's ability to stay liquid throughout the shutdown. Zillow will emerge from the shutdowns as a leaner, higher-margin business. Rich Barton, Zillow's CEO, has also noted that even in a worst-case stress scenario for Zillow, the company would still end 2020 with $1.35 billion in cash.There's no doubt that the slowdown in the housing market will hurt Zillow's Premier Agent revenues and increase holding costs for homes on Zillow's balance sheet, but Zillow's ~$4 billion loss in market value since February hugely overstates the potential impact of the coronavirus. We're optimistic about the fact that stable web traffic for Zillow and cost optimizations in the Premier Agent business will position Zillow for continued growth when the housing market rebounds."
4367033,105617,2020-08-10T09:56:49-04:00,"Z earnings were better than feared, sending shares up over 11% to end the first week of August.Existing home sales are starting to recover, and Z has resumed operations with its Offers segment.However, record-low mortgage rates are fueling demand, but low inventory and tighter credit could cause the housing market to slow.","Zillow (Z/ZG) ended last week on a strong note, with earnings better than feared for the online real estate site. Momentum for Zillow has been strong, with shares up over 20% from February's high, after rallying over 200% since March. While Zillow is seeing accelerated trends within home-buying, pent up demand leading to rising home prices could weaken that shift slightly, and end Zillow's overperformance.Zillow's growth story was arguably hit hard by the pandemic, with the lockdown orders causing a sharp shift down in home sales from March to May. Zillow also had to pause operations in its own buying and selling segment, Zillow Offers, which is now up and running again in all 24 cities after about 5 months of inactivity.Diving into home sales, Zillow is capitalizing on the rebound in existing and new home sales during the second quarter.Source: St. Louis FEDOn a monthly, non-seasonally adjusted basis (shown above), existing home sales are nearly level on a YoY basis after some weakness in the early stages of the pandemic, where existing home sales cratered on a seasonally adjusted annual rate (shown below).Source: St. Louis FEDWhereas before the pandemic, seasonally adjusted existing home sales were running above 5 million, that annual rate dropped to below 4 million for May; so while non-seasonally adjusted data doesn't look that negative, existing home sales did slump, and are in the upwards stages of a recovery fueled in part by the same pandemic that caused the decline. New single-family home sales, on the same seasonally adjusted annual rate, hit a V recovery much quicker than existing home sales, with a rebounding starting in late April.These declines in home sales caused Zillow's revenue and revenue growth curves to fall dramatically, but understandably so. Zillow had 3 consecutive quarters of over 100% revenue growth YoY, but Q2's YoY growth of 28.2% fell to just below Q4 2018's 29.4%.Source: Z FinancialsZillow's performance for Q2 came in much better than estimates, as Zillow's CEO believes that a home 'reshuffling' has begun during the quarter and will continue as a driver for Zillow for the next few years.CEO Rich Barton hit it quite spot on - ""Zoom meetings are changing the way families think about space and privacy. Home offices are in high demand. Backyards are more desirable than parks and gyms. Work-from-home policies are eliminating the commute for many."" All of these shifts and more are creating this new dynamic, where there no longer is such a desire to urbanize; instead, the pandemic has created a new desire to have more space and privacy in and out of the home.But combining this newfound trend of home desirability with record-low interest rates is creates a higher-priced market - it's simple supply and demand. Record-low mortgage rates are attracting new buyers left and right as affordability is increasing, yet prices are rising because the existing home supply has fallen to a 4-year low.According to the NAHB Housing Opportunity Index, the median sale price has risen just under 10% from $280,000 in Q1 to $300,000 in Q2, partly due to ""a frenzied environment of multiple bids, price escalation clauses and inspection waivers"" as buyers compete to purchase new homes at record-low rates.And as banks ""continued to tighten lending standards in July, further restricting available credit,"" the available inventory will not be able to sustain such a frenzy of purchasing. Even with record-low mortgages, tighter credit piled upon potentially tighter incomes will push home affordability higher, and the overall pace of the housing market recovery will likely falter.Overall, Zillow looks to be pricing in more of a recovery than is possible; shares had momentum going into the pandemic, and while that momentum evaporated quickly, it has recovered just as quickly and more. YoY revenue growth is unlikely to eclipse triple digits again this fiscal year as that would require record quarterly revenues; revenues will still grow, but likely at a similar ~30% YoY rate.Shares look to be hoping for a resumption of triple-digit YoY growth. The housing market might pose some challenges for Zillow in the next four months, with less inventory, higher demand sparked by record-low mortgage rates pushing prices higher, while tighter credit could push affordability out of the hands of potential buyers. Zillow's momentum-fueled rally could be nearing its end, and prices could consolidate in and around the $70-$80 mark."

It evolved, as many service-related websites did, into a New Age media company, free to readers/viewers and sustained by ad revenues. Zillow's main media attraction is ""Zestimates"", which is a database-generated estimate of essentially all of the homes in the U.S. The company claims that, for listed homes, the degree of error for its price estimate is only 2%, and 8% for unlisted homes. Pretty darn good. I assume a material percentage of Zillow's visits are from various real estate professionals - realtors, mortgage lenders, appraisers, etc. - but current and would-be homeowners clearly have a recurring interest as well.Zillow's primary source of ad revenues is realtors, both for home sales and to a far lesser extent for rentals. IMT also gets some revenue from banner ads bought by other real estate entities. Zillow charges realtors fees for viewership and for actual leads.How much do realtors spend on marketing? My estimate is about $4 billion a year, using the following math:IMT's revenues are currently running at $1.2 billion annualized. That suggests Zillow's current market share is about 30%. That's a lot; good for them. Let's look at the ways Zillow could grow share.Increase its viewership? If Zillow grows its audience, realtors should happily pay Zillow more to access them, right? Zillow's outstanding success has been building viewership. Nearly 200 million unique users visit its website each quarter. That is an astounding 60% of the U.S. population! And they visit a remarkable 8 billion times a year, or nearly once a week for the average user. Here's a history of users and views:Source: Zillow financial statementsThe viewer base is leveling out! Which makes sense - as I said above, 60% of Americans already use Zillow. While grade schoolers remain largely untapped, I'm guessing that realtor/advertisers don't see them as a profitable demographic. So, materially growing viewership is quite unlikely to help them grow advertising market share.New technology? Zillow is counting on its technology advances to help take more share. For example, from its Q1 '20 earnings conference call:But, of course, Zillow isn't the only company to figure out that technology can simplify the real estate process. Here are two very recent (May 21, 2020) headlines from real estate trade journal Housing Wire:It seems unlikely that Zillow can gain more than a temporary technological competitive advantage.Competitors heading for the hills? Could competitors for realtor ad spending share give up before Zillow's might? I couldn't find market share data, so I went online. I asked Google ""Where can I find a realtor?"" Here is what I learned:On the flip side, could current ad customers get upset with Zillow? As I'll explain, both Zillow Offers and Zillow Home Mortgage put the company in competition with its advertisers. Will some get annoyed and shift to other advertising outlets? Hard to forecast, but it is certainly a real risk.So, yes, Zillow is the 800-pound gorilla in realtor advertising. But it is far from the only ape in the jungle.With some minor adjustments made by me to account for Offers and Home Mortgage, here's how much IMT earned in recent years:Sources: Zillow financial statementsHere are the highlights as I see them:The table above showed that IMT earned $0.49 per share annualized during Q1. Q2 results will start reflecting the pandemic, so of course, they will be weaker; almost certainly a loss. For example, Zillow cut its ad rates up to 50% to keep volume up (so New Age!). And I assume results will be subpar through at least 2021 because of economic turmoil.But let's dream a little. Things get back to normal. IMT creates more cost efficiencies. Could today's $100 million profit run rate triple? Could IMT earn $1.50 in EPS for Zillow? I say yes.Two key factors influence my valuation:The bad news suggests a P/E in the single digits. The good news should take the P/E into the 12-15 range. Combining the $1.50 EPS target and the 12-15 P/E ratio produces a roughly $20 per share value for IMT.So, here's Zillow's problem. A $20 per share stock price just doesn't cut it. Not when your actual stock price is running in the $40s and $50s, as it largely has for the past four years. So, what's a management to do? Pivot!If your kingdom is too small, imagine a larger kingdom. In modern tech-speak, that means a larger ""addressable market"". Check out Zillow's potential addressable markets, quoting from its 2019 annual report:I'll stop there, but Zillow added five other ""addressable markets"".The addressable market shift began in 2018, when Zillow launched started Zillow Offers. Then, it bought a mortgage banker to create Zillow Home Loans. Let's assess the value creation of these two moves.Again, Zillow Offers buys and flips homes, providing sellers and buyers with an alternative to a transaction with the realtor in the middle. I compare the economics of the two types of transactions this way:Zillow's Q1 earnings presentation gives a good snapshot of the economics of the business from its viewpoint:Source: Zillow Q1 '20 presentationZillow buys knowing it usually has renovation costs, so adding up the purchase price and renovations left it with a gross profit of 5.5% of its sale price. That gross profit did not cover Zillow's cost to maintain the property while it owned it (holding costs plus interest expenses), plus its selling costs. So, the operating profit per home sold was ($4,478) and for all the sales was ($11) million. And that is before overhead expenses of somewhere north of $50 million, for a total $89 million quarterly loss for Zillow Offers as a business. Total losses for the past five quarters were $401 million! Not good.What is Zillow thinking? I can think of three possibilities:1. Its Zestimates home price estimator is so good that it can consistently find underpriced homes in large quantities. Not likely. While the housing market is not as efficient and stocks and bonds, it does a good job of finding the appropriate potential buyers of each home. And there is a large cottage industry of contractors and other individuals constantly on the hunt for bargains, especially for fixer-uppers. Finally, the introduction of buy-to-rent institutional buyers (Invitation Homes (NYSE:INVH) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) e.g.) has increased efficiency further.2. It can grab the large profit that realtors make on their commissions. Very unlikely - the realtor business stinks. Zillow noted that there are 86,000 real estate brokerage entities in the U.S. The biggest is Realogy (RLGY). Its market share is about 15%. That's a pretty small market share for an industry leader. Redfin (RDFN), another market leader, has a mere 1% share. Let's check out their earnings:Sources: Realogy and Redfin company reportsDepressing. Here is what Realogy said about the competitiveness of its business (2019 annual report, page 21):3. It can use proprietary technology to far more cheaply complete the purchase/sale transaction. Once again, not likely, except for perhaps a short period of time, as I noted above.Three strikes, Zillow Offers is out. I value it at zero. Less than zero is a real possibility.When I was a professional stock analyst, mortgage lenders were a big part of my coverage. It was a dispiriting group to follow. Lomas & Nettleton was the major independent mortgage banker when I started out in the mid-'80s. It went bust. Then a big mortgage refinance boom in the early '90s brought a bunch of mortgage bankers public. Within a few years, when the refi boom ended, they went bust, or got bought out by dumb banks which then had to shut them down after a big write-off. Then subprime mortgage lending took off, bringing a different group of mortgage bankers public. Guess what? They ended up going bust. Several times. There was one constant throughout these years, one shining star - Countrywide Credit. It survived and thrived. Then came the '07-'09 Financial Crisis. Countrywide went bust. Seeing a trend?Today's environment is no better for mortgage bankers. The problem has always been too much competition. Largely because of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, pretty much all home mortgage lenders have the same lending standards and prices. It is very easy to enter and leave the business. As a result:Today, there are very few public mortgage banking companies. PennyMac (PFSI) is the star of the group, at $29 and with real earnings. But Impac Mortgage (IMH) is at $1.57, and it cumulatively lost money over the past three years. Ocwen Financial (OCN) is at $0.64 and lost money for at least the past seven years.The import of this sad story for Zillow is clear. It will never cover the cost of its capital allocated to this business. I value Zillow Home Mortgage at $0. As with Zillow Offers, a negative value is very possible.Zillow's equity financing adds two risks to shareholders. The first risk is concentrated voting power. Zillow has three classes of common stock. Class A shares (59 million outstanding) have one vote per share. Class B shares (6.2 million outstanding) have 10 votes per share. Class C shares (157 million outstanding) have no vote. All of the B shares are held by two founders, so together they have voting control of the company while owning only 3% of the shares. They seem to like it that way, since only C shares were issued in the recent stock offering. Hopefully, Messrs. Barton and Frink will act in the other shareholders' interests, but you never know.The other risk is share dilution, which means that more shares will be issued to dilute the investors' percentage ownership of the company. One source of dilution is stock option grants to employees. I believe that about 30 million employee stock options are outstanding (about 14% of shares outstanding). Second, Zillow has five convertible notes outstanding, including one recently issued. The dilution risk is just about impossible to analyze, at least by me, because Zillow had paid substantial amounts to reduce dilution risk. But to the best of my ability, I guess that something over 30 million shares could be issued under these securities. This amount of potential ownership dilution is very high compared to most companies.I actually will sum up:$20 per share for IMT+$0 for Zillow Offers+$0 for Zillow Home Mortgage$20 per share fair value. The stock is currently $61. Zell, don't Buy."
4356403,103480,2020-06-30T13:22:04-04:00,"Shares of Zillow are in positive year-to-date territory after the company released a surprisingly strong Q1.
        Revenues in the core Premier Agent business accelerated in Q1 (despite the introduction of Flex pricing) and is making a solid post-pandemic recovery.
        Zillow also hit breakeven gross margins in its Homes segment, where it plans to restart home-buying.
        Drastically lower interest rates on mortgages should help Zillow Homes hit profitability faster.","Zillow (Z) is a stock that many investors love to hate. Ever since Zillow started rolling out its principal home-buying program, Zillow Offers (a move that was soon copied by Redfin Now (RDFN)) investors, the market has bashed Zillow as a low-growth stock that is straying away from its core internet advertising business to participate in speculative house-flipping. Yet what I see in Zillow is am integrated technology company that wants to own as many pieces of the real-estate buying process as possible - from coordinating agents to securing mortgages and buying homes directly. Zillow's access to real estate data - and the reliance of consumers upon Zillow for real estate research across its portfolio of brands, including Trulia and StreetEasy - is second to none. Investors have seemingly begun to buy into the bullish thesis for this stock this year (shares are up ~25% year-to-date).Since I last wrote on Zillow in late April, the stock has been on a tear. Fundamentals are appearing much stronger than feared - originally investors sold off Zillow on the dual premise that 1) a slowdown in real estate transactions would hurt Zillow's Premier Agent business, which derives advertising revenues from real estate agents, and 2) cratering house prices would cause steeper losses in the Homes division.And while the coronavirus certainly did introduce uncertainties in the U.S. real estate market, the outcome has been far more benign than feared. With the Fed supporting a reduction in interest rates to near all-time lows, plus the easing of restrictions in various markets across the U.S., real estate demand has rebounded - and as we'll discuss shortly, Zillow itself has also provided a linearity of its projected rebound.The bottom line on Zillow: there's more upside here. Zillow is the most prominent company leading the charge to disrupt real estate via technology, and despite the more speculative nature of its Homes division (which is still unprofitable, but relatively new and packed with potential), Zillow has a stable and cash-flowing internet advertising business to finance its expansion. Stay long here.Let's start first with how Zillow's flagship Premier Agent business, the primary revenue driver in its overall IMT (Internet, Media, and Technology) segment, fared in Q1 before moving on to post-pandemic recovery trends.The IMT segment as a whole had a great first quarter, despite the onset of coronavirus headwinds hitting in March. We note primarily that Zillow managed to grow adjusted EBITDA by 40% y/y in the segment to $85.7 million, representing a huge 540bps margin expansion.Figure 1. Zillow IMT segment resultsSource: Zillow Q1 shareholder letterDriving this surge was an 11% y/y increase in core Premier Agent revenues. That's impressive on three counts:The last point is especially meaningful. Though last year many investors regarded Zillow's core Premier Agent business as stagnant and oversaturated, it seems now that Zillow's ""baseline"" revenue growth has trended back to the mid-teens. The introduction of Flex may also make Zillow even more popular as a flexible advertising choice amid a difficult environment for many real estate agents.Let's now move onto how Zillow fared post-March. The yellow line in the chart below shows that consumer interest in Zillow has rebounded sharply since the March downturn, with site visits across Zillow's portfolio of brands back up to nearly 10% y/y through April:Figure 2. Zillow post-Q1 trendsSource: Zillow Q1 shareholder letterThe blue line, meanwhile, shows Zillow's revenue performance as an index against a December baseline. As expected, a slowdown in real estate activity in Q2 led to a sharp decline in April - but we can also see that Zillow is projecting, through May and June, for revenues to climb back to near-normal levels. What's also not considered here when Zillow offered up this view in early May is the fact that the Fed offered substantial interest rate support throughout May, leading to a surge in summer real estate activity through the present.We'll now turn the discussion to Homes, the more controversial of Zillow's two main lines of business. Again let's look at Q1 performance first before discussing the post-pandemic environment. The key thing to note is that in Q1, Zillow finally achieved gross margin breakeven on homes sold, with pre-interest return hitting 4bps in the quarter - up a full 50bps from -46bps in the year-ago quarter. Figure 3. Zillow Homes Q1 resultsSource: Zillow Q1 shareholder letterThis improvement validates Zillow's thesis that as Zillow Offers gains in scale, the company will be able to capture economies of scale. We note as well that because of Zillow's decision to pause home buying in late Q1, the company managed to reduce inventory of homes for sale quarter-over-quarter.Of course, when factoring in interest expense, the Homes division is still producing a 139bps loss. But interest rates have been on a consistent downtrend, as the chart from Freddie Mac below can attest:Figure 4. Mortgage rate trendsSource: freddiemac.comOver the past twelve months, the standard 30-year mortgage rate has fallen 60bps from 3.73% to a present average of just 3.13%. Of course, Zillow's financing for its homes isn't on standard mortgages, but this still represents a good proxy of how interest costs have fallen - which should help Zillow reach profitability in its Homes segment faster. As of early June, Zillow has restarted its home buying efforts in fifteen of its twenty-four Zillow Homes markets. We're hoping Zillow can take advantage of current market dislocations to buy homes at a bargain. We also like the fact that Zillow has built up its cash balances to a record high of $2.6 billion as of the end of Q1, giving the company plenty of liquidity to continue expanding:Figure 5. Zillow cash trendsSource: Zillow Q1 shareholder letterThere's a lot to like about Zillow at the moment. On the Premier Agent side, revenue trends accelerated into Q1 despite revenue deferrals coming from the introduction of the Flex pricing model - and post-Q1, Zillow has pointed to a rebound alongside the recovery of real estate activity across the U.S. In Zillow Homes, the company is restarting home-buying in a majority of its markets, and Zillow's larger scale plus lower interest rates should help it close the gap to profitability. Stay long here."
4314733,103064,2019-12-31T15:16:26-05:00,"I present (and have uploaded) a detailed, transparent financial model of iBuying.The model allows various iBuying approaches to be compared.Unlike the story told by iBuyers, I find that economies of scale are limited in iBuying. This is unfavorable for Zillow.The largest cost input for iBuyers is agent commissions - this favors brokerages in the iBuying space, such as Redfin.A housing downturn could be disastrous for overzealous iBuyers.","Instant, institutional home buying, or ""iBuying"" has dominated the headlines of real estate media, raised well over $2Bln in equity (and far more including debt), and has become the largest revenue growth driver for two publicly-traded companies, Zillow (ZG, Z) and Redfin (RDFN). ""iBuying"" is the business of buying and selling a home for a fee, providing the home seller with quick liquidity and saving them the hassle of listing and showing the home.Some of the more notable iBuying institutions include the ""pure iBuyers"" Opendoor, Offerpad, and Knock, as well as the real estate media tech company Zillow, the tech-powered brokerage Redfin, and, more recently, the traditional brokerages Keller Williams and Realogy (RLGY). Such rapid growth in this space has led some to speculate that iBuying is the future of residential real estate, despite warnings that the enterprise is a disaster-in-the-making. Others, however, maintain a more agnostic, informational stance.As an overweight shareholder of Redfin, I do not have the luxury of remaining agnostic on this topic. Furthermore, I think that anyone invested in the residential real estate space - either through public brokerages (RMAX, RLGY), rental services (AMH), home builders (ITB), or even simply home ownership - needs to have an informed opinion of iBuying; it has already altered the dynamics of this industry in numerous markets. However, I've found that the available information on iBuying lacks the detail and flexibility, i.e. an interactive financial model, needed to inform a grounded opinion about how iBuying might affect their investments.To this end, I have two goals in this article.First, I'll share a financial model of ""iBuying"". This goal is simply informational and is the main purpose of the article. My aim is to establish a base case of variables, values, and terminology as a foundation for future discussion. I have uploaded an excel file containing the model so that my assumed relationships between variables are fully transparent. I hope this model will be valuable to other investors by allowing them to test their own assumed input values. Moreover, I encourage challenges to the model in the Comments section, which should help us all ""crowd source"" the correct financial model for iBuying.But, I didn't derive the model just for fun. I did it to know whether iBuying was a risk or opportunity for my investment in Redfin, as well as to see if I should buy another put on Zillow (I successfully closed a Zillow put in August). As such, my second goal is to use the model to explore different iBuying approaches and simulate how iBuying might fare in different macroeconomic climates.With these sensitivity analyses, I'll show that pre-existing brokerages have an advantage in the iBuying space due to their control over commissions; this particularly favors Redfin. Additionally, I'll argue that there are limited economies of scale in iBuying, which is negative for the ""pure iBuyers"". Even worse, I'll suggest that Zillow is caught in a catch-22 because iBuyers are strongly incentivized to drive down commissions. This will lead me to speculate that an ironic outcome of the growth of iBuyers might be to expedite what I believe is the US's inevitable trajectory toward the lower commissions of other countries. That said, I'll also show that iBuying is as risky as some have advertised.Thus, taken together, I aim to show that iBuying is strongly negative for Zillow, neutral to slightly negative for traditional brokerages, and neutral to slightly positive for Redfin.Others have done a fantastic job of providing the history, scope, and strategic fit of iBuying, particularly Mike DelPrete. My aim, however, is to get deep into the details.Let's define iBuying Revenue as follows.Here, Fees = fibuyer*(Home Purchase Price). Typically, fibuyer is ~6 to 10%. Additionally, we can borrow the parlance of equity brokerages to define Spread as the difference between the selling price and the purchase price of the home. Thus:Right away, I've broken down the reported revenues of iBuyers. On SEC documents, iBuyer revenue is reported as Home Selling Price + Fees. This makes sense since these companies are outlaying cash to acquire these homes, which is recorded as outgoing cash flow. However, it can be quite misleading to think of revenue this way - iBuyers stand no chance of ever reaping anywhere close to 100% of that revenue. Consider that an optimistic 3% price appreciation and a standard 7% iBuyer's fee imply a de facto revenue max for iBuying of 10% of the residential real estate market.This obvious reality has not stopped Zillow CEO Rich Barton from bragging about a ""trillion-dollar TAM"" (TAM = total addressable market). The putative ""trillion-dollar TAM"" is referring to the $1.6 trillion of residential real estate value that changed hands last year. I'm not alone in realizing how absurd it is to refer to the iBuying ""TAM"" this way. Big Short protagonist Steve Eisman revealed why he has a large short position in Zillow:What gives me pause about Barton's claim that the TAM of Zillow should be measured in trillions is that Rich Barton also considers Zillow's new instant home buying business as ""market making"". The prototypical market makers are equity brokerages that bring liquidity to the stock market. Does this mean that we should say that the TAM of equity brokerages is the value of all common stock transactions? Of course, not. And for the same reason, the ""TAM"" of being a market maker in residential real estate is not the value of all home transactions.That aside, it is important to keep in mind that my definition of revenue will greatly inflate margins as percentages of revenue relative to those reported by iBuyers.As for the iBuying cost of revenue, we have:Breaking these out, we find:While a lot of these costs are common sense, I was also heavily influenced by Zillow's reported unit economics, and, especially (again) Mike DelPrete's analysis.Before moving on, please take a closer look at ""holding costs"", which is a wildcard for iBuyers. If a local municipality or neighborhood decides that iBuyers are harming their community, they have the ability to litigate extra costs. This makes holding costs an unpredictable risk for iBuyers.Now, going deeper we see that:And:Where I have assumed that the Debt Origination Fees are ~ 0 because the fee to establish a large credit facility is spread over many transactions.Furthermore, I assume that:Thus, together we have:And so, for Gross Margin we have:Finally, we need to account for SG&A, fixed costs, and interest expenses to calculate net income. These expenses are more difficult to estimate for iBuyers. Particularly, it is unclear what percentage of SG&A and fixed costs should be attributed to iBuying for the non-pure iBuyers (e.g. Zillow and Redfin) who share back-end processes across many different revenue streams.Furthermore, it is not clear if all of the line items that I outlined above belong above the line. For example, it appears that Zillow counts agent commissions in SG&A. This is, in my opinion, a spurious allocation. Zillow states:In other words, Zillow tucks away some of the largest expenses related to iBuying under general SG&A for the whole company. Zillow also reports iBuying income on an EBITDA basis, even though ""ITDA"" stands to be a non-negligible ongoing drag on iBuying cash flows. (And let's not forget what Charlie Munger says about EBITDA earnings - warning: earmuffs).In contrast, Redfin more conservatively includes commissions and other costs in their iBuying gross margin and has publicly taken issue with the non-GAAP iBuying reporting by ""other"" iBuyers.In my model, I've kept most of the expenses above the line, closer in flavor to Redfin's accounting. As for net income, here's what I've come up with.As such, I've ignored the fixed costs and SG&A associated with iBuying to simplify cross-company analysis. This assumption has two implications. One, it means that my net income is an overestimate of reality. Two, it means that larger iBuyers might be disadvantaged by my analysis since they have better leverage on SG&A and fixed costs per home. For simplicity, I've also ignored taxes and depreciation.All that's left, then, is to derive an expression for Interest Expense.Where:This demonstrates that inventory turning favors faster iBuyers because:So, for Interest Expense we find:Finally, we have:Let's put some real numbers to this. As realistic touchstones, we can compare these values to the links above for Zillow's reported values and Mike DelPrete's model. That said, I'm not suggesting that these values represent a particular company. Rather, it is a ""toy model"" rooted in reality that will allow us to understand the forces at work for iBuyers.Figure 1. iBuying Base Case ModelIn the base case of Figure 1, the yellow values are assumptions that I input. Here, the average home is held in inventory for 42 days (I've added 14 days on top of the 28 days-on-market per the Redfin report). The home value appreciates from $287,000 by 3% (per Mike DelPrete for appreciation and Zillow's 2018 annual report for the sold home value, although Zillow has increased their average home value in recent quarters). The service fee is 7% (approximately Zillow Offer's fee). The Buyer's and Listing agent fees are set to industry norms. The closing costs, concessions, renovation fees, and holding fees are populated using commonsense values and approximately match those of the Mike DelPrete model. The total homes in inventory are set to 3000 to approximately match Zillow's most recent report. And finally, the percentage of home inventory financed, 85%, as well as the interest rate on the revolving credit facility, 4.73%, are borrowed from Zillow's 2018 Annual Report.To me, these realistic base case parameters are deeply troubling for iBuyers. They suggest a FY run rate of ($99MM) net income with a (13%) net income margin at the scale in the model (3000 homes in inventory). You might say - the author must be wrong because Zillow reports a gross margin of $11K per home. I don't think the data support that notion; last quarter, Zillow posted a net income of ($65MM) versus ($0.5MM) the year before. This growing loss can be attributed almost entirely to Zillow Offers. Of course, I recognize that Zillow was a net purchaser of homes during this time. But, accounting for that still doesn't make the numbers pretty. For example, in my model, the quarterly loss is ~($25MM). Thus, Zillow would've needed to be purchasing homes ~3X faster than selling them to match my already dire model. Instead, Zillow's buy/sell rate was only 2291/1211 ~ 2. Thus, I'm left to conclude that my model is perhaps rosier than Zillow's reality and is at least in the ballpark of actual iBuying financials.So, how do iBuyers intend to walk to profitability (aside from using it as a loss leader for ancillary businesses)? The standard argument is ""economies of scale"". Looking at the model, I only see three inputs that can be leveraged at scale - renovations, holding costs, and interest. The argument for renovation efficiency is that home inventory density, contracts with a defined contractor base, and data on worthwhile renovations will reduce costs. I'm not entirely sold on renovation economies of scale argument but will entertain the idea. The argument is clearer for holding costs and interest; the faster you turn inventory, the cheaper these values become per home. So, how do the numbers look?(Note that another benefit of scale is that variability in home valuation error gets washed out as the number of homes sold increases. My model implicitly assumes that the cost of valuation noise is zero because it is a deterministic model).Figure 2. iBuyers with Economies of ScaleIn Figure 2, I've halved the average days inventory to just 21 days and cut renovation costs to 1% (from the 1.5% base case). I did this without changing price appreciation, which is a stretch because cheaper renovations and fewer days on the market would likely correlate with lower price appreciation. I also scaled up the average number of homes in inventory to 4,009, which yields Zillow's transactions value target of $20Bln per year. The resulting interest per home dropped to $664, which is 50% lower.The result of these optimistic inputs for an iBuyer with ""economies of scale"" is only a break-even scenario. This is particularly ominous because the aggressive 21 days in inventory is very unlikely in any macroeconomic conditions that do strongly favor sellers. Furthermore, if you look closely, the debt needed for this scenario is ~$1Bln. It is a tightrope!Of course, we can play with the numbers and paint a better picture.Figure 3. iBuyers with Economies of Scale, Cost Leadership, and Increased FeeIn Figure 3, I've further reduced the renovation costs to 0.5%, increased the service fee to 8%, and decreased the closing costs and concessions to 1% each. In this very optimistic scenario, net income increased to $500MM at a 23% margin, with the same working debt of $1Bln. Therefore, it is not impossible for iBuying to be a solid business model, but it requires a company to be firing on all cylinders in a seller's market and to warrant a market leading service fee.But, it is hard to imagine any particular iBuyer demanding a leading service fee because the services are not differentiated. In such race-to-bottom industries, the only way to win is to be a cost leader (think large commodity producers) or use network effects to gain a pseudo-monopoly (think cable companies and Uber).It doesn't look to me like cost leadership is a possibility because economies of scale are not in play. However, I don't deny that Zillow Offers has a strong customer acquisition advantage over the pure iBuyers and a decent advantage over Redfin. But, my model sees the enterprise as producing negative income before considering customer acquisition cost, so it is a moot point. Furthermore, I would not underestimate consumers' shopping habits with so much money at stake, and we're already seeing partnerships close the customer acquisition gap.Furthermore, I do not believe that network effects exist for iBuying. The definition of network effects is that, for every new user in a network, there is more value to every other user in that network. For example, with Uber, every new rider adds value as a possible customer to every driver, and every new driver reduces the wait time for riders. Nothing like this is possible with iBuying. With every new home seller that decides to sell to an iBuyer, there is not an added benefit to the existing owners who have sold to an iBuyer. Perhaps the unannounced, but ultimate ""moonshot"" for iBuyers is to build a trade-in platform that becomes a two-sided network (two-sided networks are prototypical network effect examples). Even this hypothetical is a weak strategy to me; the MLS already acts as a two-sided marketplace, so the real goal ought to be to eliminate the cost to get to the MLS, which is Redfin's mission.The key takeaway here, though, is that ""economies of scale"" is not the best approach to become profitable as an iBuyer because the largest costs in the model are variable costs. A quick glance at the base case (Figure 1) shows that agent commissions are eating up 51.5% of iBuying revenue. This compares to about 31% of revenue for the combination of the ""scaleable"" holding costs, interest expense, and renovations.On the other hand, commissions cannot be scaled. For Zillow, this is an unfortunate irony. They need to cut commissions for iBuying to become more profitable, but their core business depends on the status quo of commissions. Indeed, Zillow pays both listing agents and buyer's agents in their iBuying business.For the pure iBuyers, commissions are also a tough situation, as they rely on agents to find buyers for their homes. However, they can adopt the strategy of reducing fees on the listing side by bringing that in-house. Let's revisit the base case (Figure 1) but with reduced listing commissions.Figure 4. iBuying Base Case with Reduced Listing Commissions.In Figure 4, we see that with listing commissions reduced to 1%, the base case achieves a positive gross margin. Interestingly, this implies that all iBuyers should list and sell with Redfin that offers 1% listing when acting as the buyer and listing representative. It also implies that companies that already broker residential transactions are best suited to profit from iBuying because they have the most control over commissions. Most notably, Redfin is in the best position to take advantage of the iBuying sensitivity to agent commissions because their employees are on a set salary and have worked for a decade with lower commissions.Another promising route to efficiency employed by iBuyers is to allow home shoppers to tour the home on demand using an app (re: Redfin Direct Access and Opendoor). Ironically, these efficiencies are only passed on to the buyer's agent because a home buyer that toured the home without representation is incredibly unlikely to also purchase that home without representation. Instead, they'll call their agent to help finalize the paperwork. Therefore, iBuyers still have to pay the Buyer's agent. Here, Redfin again appears to be the company putting downward pressure on these superfluous commissions.On the one hand, Redfin has made the bold move to publicly post the Buyer's commission that a seller is willing to pay next to a listing. If this transparency carries any clout, the entire iBuying enterprise could expedite the lowering of buyer's agent commissions. Indeed, iBuyers have a stronger incentive to try to push the buyer's commission lower than they do to increase throughput. If my model is correct, then 1.5% of agent commissions is worth 60 days of holding costs and ~3X interest costs. It will be interesting to see what traditional agents do when their clients ask ""why am I not seeing this home?"" Or, more poignantly, when they tour the home by themselves and tell their agent that they are buying it. This line of reasoning heavily favors Redfin and hurts Zillow. A systematic decrease in commissions would crush Zillow's core business, which ironically is exactly what they need to do to bolster their iBuying business.An even stronger move to reduce buyer's agent commissions, however, is Redfin Direct. With Redfin Direct, home buyers can place an offer on a home without representation. The fee to the home seller then becomes a mere 1% to Redfin (+ the listing fee, 2% total if with Redfin). Redfin has built the Redfin Direct software as a questionnaire that populates with local housing information to guide the home buyer through the process of making their own offer for a home. Clearly, an iBuyer (including Redfin Now) would love to field Redfin Direct offers. And, since not all iBuyers are seasoned brokerages - or even are national brokerages - it would be beneficial for iBuyers to be a third-party user of the Redfin Direct software. Indeed, Redfin entertained opening their services up to third parties on their last earnings call.So, let's look at the base case with commissions reduced to 2%, which is the Redfin Listed + Redfin Direct fee.Figure 5. iBuying Base Case with Redfin Direct CommissionsThe scenario in Figure 5 is the most profitable base case and a solidly profitable business, with comfortable wiggle room to handle moderate shifts in the inputs. The reason is simple: brokerage commissions are the costliest input to iBuying, thus the best way to be a profitable iBuyer is to cut the cost of commissions.One of the biggest worries with iBuying is the risk of carrying so many homes on the balance sheet. Interestingly, the current macroeconomic conditions are perfect for iBuying: low interest rates, low housing supply, and appreciating home values. iBuyers should not bank on this forever. What happens to the profitable, aggressively optimistic, $20Bln run rate case from Figure 3 if the market turns?Figure 6. iBuying in a Housing Market DownturnThe result would be a disaster. In Figure 6, we see that if the homes were offloaded at a -3% spread and the holding time increased to 60 days, then the FY numbers would show a $307MM loss on $1Bln in debt. This loss would be more than Zillow's 2018 FY Adjusted EBITDA (and again, I'm not a fan of Zillow highlighting Adjusted EBITDA when GAAP net income has been negative for seven years running).Data by YChartsAnd despite what iBuyers will say, I see no way to avoid the risk of a housing downturn by renting the property or increasing the service fees. Indeed, a 12.4% service fee (2.5X status quo commissions) would be needed to break even in the Figure 6 scenario - no one would take that offer. As for rent, with the 4,009 homes in inventory (Figure 6) to recoup the $307MM lost would require charging $307,000,000/4009 homes/12 months = $6,381 per month in rent per home. Again, no takers.One could argue that the scale of the operations that I've modeled in Figure 6 is too high because as home prices began to drop, the companies would stop purchasing homes. Again, I'm skeptical of this optimism. Zillow argues, for example, that housing downturns are usually geographically isolated events, so the mix of home purchasing can be shifted accordingly.The wisdom of our elders should guide us here. Consider:Yet, non-isolated housing downturns of a few percentages aren't rare, and large scale iBuyers are risking substantial permanent capital losses on the premise that they can predict the ups and downs of short-term cycles better than others. For instance, imagine an iBuyer that does not want to lose revenue, so they attempt to shift mix away from a weakening market by ramping up volume elsewhere, only for home values in the new region to unexpectedly drop even worse than the original market. This is not a far-fetched scenario, and worse, it is not in the company's control.In fact, the bravado of large-scale iBuying reminds me of another Buffett classic, ""nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money.""OK, but maybe the low commissions iBuyer would be safe. Not so. Even in the reduced commissions scenario of Figure 5, while updating it to match the optimistic cost profile and inventory of Figure 6, a housing market slowdown is disastrous (Figure 7).Figure 7. iBuying in a Housing Market Downturn with Low CommissionsThe upshot is, at-scale, iBuying is deeply risky and depends on fast inventory turns (a seller's market), appreciating home values (a seller's market), and, to a lesser extent, low interest rates on borrowing (analysis not explored in this article). Importantly, these criteria are all macroeconomic forces that are out of the control of iBuyers.After all that apocalyptic talk, I'll leave with some hope - the Best Case Scenario. Here, I keep the inventory turns, fee, and cost profile of Figure 3, but update the commissions to the ""Redfin Direct"" structure.Figure 8. iBuying's Best Case ScenarioI'll remind you that I think that Figure 8 is a ceiling, but it's nice to look at!I've built a financial model of iBuying and laid out each term and their assumed values with full transparency. I've supplied the excel file with this article. I went out on a limb to start the conversation about the details of iBuying because the actual numbers are hard to find when searching the web. The reason that I showed each little step and value is to invite criticism of the model - through refinement we should be able to reach a solid understanding of iBuying financials.That said, I believe that my model is supported by commonsense and the data that we do have. If it is correct, it provides three clear conclusions about iBuyers: 1. Economies of scale are limited levers, 2. Commissions are the enemy of iBuyers, and 3. A housing market slowdown could be disastrous for iBuyers who have too much inventory to offload.The solution to (1) and (2) favors existing brokerages in the short-term because they have more control over commissions. In particular, (2) favors Redfin and those that partner with Redfin, as Redfin is the lowest cost provider of brokerage services that still reaches the entire MLS audience. To me, I do not see a solution to (3), other than being very cautious with inventory.Longer term, I see iBuying expediting the downward pressure on commissions, which is a secular trend that strongly favors Redfin through their current infrastructure, and especially with their newer offerings Redfin Direct and Redfin Direct Access. On the other hand, Zillow is caught in a catch-22 - either go all in as an iBuyer, which implies an incentive to push reduced commissions cannibalizing the current cash flow, or try to keep commissions high, but maintain dangerously negative cash flow on iBuying.Beyond that, I see any risk-on attitudes toward iBuying by management and highly levered housing inventory on a balance sheet as a red flag. Thus, I'm strongly bearish on Zillow. Admittedly, I would like to see less home inventory on Redfin's balance sheet, but I see the net outcome of iBuying as a neutral to positive for Redfin. My hope is that Redfin looks to fund their iBuying with external partnerships, as well as support other iBuyers with their technologies and low-fee services, as opposed to going all-in themselves with Redfin Now. They seem to be toeing this line with caution currently, as evidenced by their relative inactivity compared to their iBuying peers (see the multiple Mike DelPrete references above).In conclusion, I remain long and overweight Redfin. I may initiate a new Zillow short position if leading macroeconomic indicators begin to flash red without commensurate share decline."
4318129,23903,2020-01-21T15:34:03-05:00,"Zillow's core Internet, Media, and Telecom (IMT) segment's adjusted non-GAAP EPS has grown consistently over the past five years.A slowdown in Zillow's IMT revenue growth may have been a contributing factor for the company's entry into higher risk real estate and mortgage businesses.Operating metrics for Zillow's Homes and Mortgage segments have not improved with scale.Added risk factors with Zillow's Homes and Mortgage segments may dilute the company's overall market valuation.","As US market indexes surge to new highs on a daily basis, the rising tide has indeed lifted all boats. While stocks for many companies deserved the lift after being sold off on geopolitical headwinds which have eased in recent months, the increased market capitalization of others may have many scratching their heads. For some, Zillow Group (Z) has been a target of increased bull bear debate. While Zillow's core online media business has a solid foundation, the company's higher risk venture into the buying and selling of residential homes could result in a dilution of the company's overall market valuation.Zillow could be an enigma to many traditional investors who gauge valuations based on earnings. This is because the company's core Internet, Media, and Technology (NYSE:IMT) business has not been profitable on a US GAAP basis in the past five fiscal years. Even after excluding share based compensation totaling $524 million from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2018, Zillow still would have posted an adjusted non-GAAP net loss of $103 million for this period. Considering the company's GAAP results included tax benefits of $125 million, operational losses appeared much worse.If we further exclude what some may consider 'non-operational' expenses such as impairment, restructuring, acquisition/integration, and legal expenses, Zillow's core IMT segment has been marginally profitable and growing in the past five full fiscal years as the chart below shows.(Data compiled from Zillow's 2018 annual report. Non-GAAP pre-tax EPS only factor operating expenses listed under sales&marketing, technology&development, and general&adminsitrative with share based compensation excluded.)Since Zillow's growth during these five fiscal years was not entirely organic and was a result of acquisitions, some may argue only amortization of goodwill would be legitimate non-GAAP exclusions. That is a fair argument since a company should not be able to benefit from acquisitions while at the same time dismissing subsequent expenses. Zillow's main acquisition was Trulia in mid-2014 which helped contribute to a more than doubling of revenues the following fiscal year. Other acquisitions included DotLoop in 2015, New Home Feed in 2017, and Home Lenders of America in 2018.In 2018 Zillow changed its business model from a technology based online platform to one involving physical assets in the housing industry. As mentioned above, the addition of Home Lenders of America broadened the company's business to home financing. Zillow's Mortgage segment is still a very small part of its overall business with fiscal 2019 revenues only expected to hit $100 million at the top end of the company's guidance compared to total revenues potentially exceeding $2.6 billion. Zillow's Mortgage segment is also expected to be the least profitable with adjusted EBITDA losses potentially exceeding 30% of segment revenues in fiscal 2019.Also in 2018, Zillow announced it would start testing a new business of buying and selling homes in select regional markets. This new business would later be expanded to other cities and named Zillow Offers which operates in the company's Homes segment. While this segment has increased the company's consolidated revenues substantially, losses have also increased as the chart below shows.(Data compiled from Zillow's 2018 annual report and 2019 quarterly results. All dollar figures in millions.)On the positive side, Zillow's Homes segment losses have been declining as a percentage of revenues generated. In fiscal 2018 when this segment was started, losses exceeded segment revenues by almost 120%. This ratio has gradually declined to 35%, 29%, and 23% in Q1, Q2, and Q3 2019, respectively. With corporate expenses for the Homes segment only increasing at 11% of incremental sequential revenue growth in the third quarter of 2019, the segment's pre-tax loss ratio should continue to decline as revenues increase. For example at the recent quarter's sequential corporate level expense increase, segment losses as a percentage of revenues would drop further to 16% on a doubling of revenues.The problem has not been with corporate level expenses for the Homes segment. The real issue has been a lack of gross profit generated from the buying and selling of homes prior to corporate level expenses. What Zillow defines as 'Return on Homes Sold After Interest Expense' in its quarterly shareholder letters is essentially the segment's gross profit which would then be labeled net income after deducting corporate expenses. While the absolute magnitude of Zillow's Home segment losses before corporate expenses have been very small in 2019, the margin trend has marginally decreased with each successive quarter as the chart below shows.(Data compiled from Zillow's 2018 annual report and 2019 quarterly results. All dollar figures in millions. Gross profit is defined as revenues from homes sold minus all non-corporate level expenses.)This Homes segment gross margin would need to turn positive to at least half a percentage point just to break even assuming Zillow reaches its target $20 billion in annual revenues, or 16x estimated fiscal 2019 levels. While the company's 2-3% adjusted EBITDA margin for its Homes segment doesn't sound like a lofty goal, it is still a long way from -17.63% posted in Q3 2019 and even worse projected for Q4 2019 at -18.85% based on midpoint guidance.At least on an adjusted basis, Zillow's IMT segment profits have been growing at a respectable rate in the past five years. Adjusted non-GAAP pre-tax EPS for the first three quarters of 2019 was $0.58 compared to fiscal 2018's full year $0.63 total. If the fourth quarter comes in as expected, fiscal 2019 totals could hit $0.80 per share. At Zillow's recent stock price, the company would be trading at about 60x adjusted earnings for its IMT segment. Of course this is a pre-tax figure since it would be difficult to gauge tax rates when the company has received more tax benefits than paid in taxes during the past half decade. Applying only the 21% Federal corporate income tax rate, Zillow would be valued at about 75x adjusted non-GAAP IMT earnings.Despite decent growth from its core IMT business, Zillow's stock would be more than fully valued based on just this segment. With IMT segment revenues currently guided to be flat in fiscal 2019 from 2018 levels after growing at 20-25% annually in previous years, Zillow's core business may have hit a short term wall. It was obvious Zillow needed another growth driver just to maintain its high market capitalization if its core business had reached a short term peak. Buying, selling, and even financing homes would be a fast way to boost revenue growth. Aside from the mounting losses Zillow's Home and Mortgage segments have generated, these new business segments increases shareholder risk by many factors.For those who still remember the dotcom bubble, E*Trade Financial (ETFC) was once a hot high flier that profited from the surge in online trading as equities went parabolic in 1999. After the bubble burst in 2000, trading activity diminished. E*Trade made a strategic decision to broaden its business outside of brokering trades to market making. In addition the company went into banking which ultimately lead to mortgage lending. Revenues and profits rebounded resulting in a six fold increase in its stock price at the height of another bubble – the housing bubble which led to the Financial Crisis of 2008.After crashing by over 97%, many thought E*Trade could go bankrupt as losses mounted and the company announced it would exit its mortgage business. A few years later the company would divest its market making unit to almost complete a round trip back to its business roots of being an online trading platform. While this may be an extreme example, it does highlight potential risks Zillow investors could face as the company increases leverage on its balance sheet to expand in highly cyclical financial and real estate businesses.With operating metrics for Zillow's new Homes and Mortgage segments getting worse despite increasing revenues, it is hard to gauge what normalized profitability would look like. Even if the Homes segment reaches company targets which require revenues to increase another sixteen fold, it would still be a very low margin and arguably higher risk business. At the very least these new financial arms would dilute Zillow's overall market valuation from an online technology based company to a financial company where valuations historically have averaged in the low teens earnings multiple.For example, assuming Zillow's Homes segment reaches the target $20 billion in annual revenues at 2-3% adjusted EBITDA, the resulting net income may only be around $300 million annually. At the current S&P 500 (SP500) 13x forward multiple for its financial components, the Homes segment would add almost $4 billion in incremental market capitalization. At Zillow's current market capitalization of $10 billion, the IMT segment would thus be valued at $5 billion or approximately 38x adjusted non-GAAP earnings if we value its Mortgage segment at $1 billion for the sake of simplicity. A fair argument could be made on Zillow already trading at fair market valuation based on a lot of yet to be realized growth.Investors should also keep in mind the housing sector has been historically very cyclical. As the chart below shows, the median home price for houses sold in the US declined by almost 19% during the Financial Crisis a dozen years ago. In fact the recent decline of 8% during the past two years has been the longest prolonged period of decline since the Financial Crisis.(Chart from St. Louis Fed.)Should the US economy weaken or enter into a recession after a decade long expansion, Zillow's new businesses would expose its balance sheet to increased home inventory and mortgage risks. As a result, Zillow's share price could be subject to increased volatility during cyclical shifts in business cycles.Finally I do want to note Zillow's stock has traded somewhat erratically with large swings after its quarterly earnings reports when results did not materially change from quarter to quarter. For the most part, Zillow's quarterly results have exceeded Wall Street expectations by slight margin in the past two years. The company's longer term strategic guidance regarding its Homes segment has not changed since revenues were first recognized in late 2018. Yet its shares have traded violently between $30 and $50, ignoring often followed moving averages, and with accelerated movement following earnings as the chart below shows.(Z daily chart with 50 and 200 day moving averages shown in green and red, respectively. A symmetric trendline has also been drawn in purple representing the stock's recent 3 month uptrend.)Unless Zillow's operating metrics change materially when its fourth quarter 2019 earnings are released, investors should be prepared for another potential wild swing especially should the stock break a well established 3 month uptrend channel. If Zillow's stock does sell off after its upcoming earnings report despite the presence of any incrementally negative news, the market may be signaling to investors the stock should be traded and not invested in at least until its new business segments show a clearer path to profitability."
4332816,105271,2020-03-18T15:57:53-04:00,"Zillow's fast-growing Homes segment seems unlikely to see profitability even with scale due to the high proportion of variable costs.As Zillow scales, it is likely to incur significant interest expense which will further erode the bottom line.High levels of inventory and credit financing for this business segment significantly increases the risk the company faces especially in an economic downturn.","Initially a real estate marketplace facilitating property transactions between buyers and lenders, Zillow (Z) (ZG) has since expanded a home-flipping business segment in April 2018, termed Zillow Offers. Under company filings, this ‘Homes’ segment has been rapidly increasing in revenue, currently representing over 50% of the company’s revenue. The market has also reacted positively to this shift, with share price rising moderately from ~$54 at the time of the announcement to an all-time high of ~$66 pre-Covid-19. However, I believe that the Street is overly bullish on Zillow’s potential to attain profitability on top of its high growth, and the unfavourable home-flipping economics will not pay off in the long-run.Firstly, non-GAAP metrics on the performance of Homes segment is misleading. Zillow’s management reported a non-GAAP “returns on homes sold after interest” of negative $22m on $1.37b sales in FY19, representing a segment margin of -1.6%. However, these losses include only specific costs such as home acquisition, renovation and holding costs. GAAP metrics as disclosed on Zillow’s 10K paints a far bleaker picture, with segment gross margin at 3.7% and operating margin at -20.7%. (Note: Operating expenses including S&M, R&D and G&A costs are segmented under Homes by management, and reflect all operating costs under this business unit.)Source: Zillow 10KHowever, consensus remains optimistic of Zillow’s growth story and ability to improve profitability with scale. Management has already outlined plans to increase the number of houses purchased to 5,000/month within 3-5 years, a target which would represent 1% of the overall US market. The strong push towards home-flipping implies that this segment would become by far the largest contributor of the group’s revenue. Many analysts covering Zillow are similarly projecting profitability by FY23-FY24.Source: Goldman Sachs' FY24 EstimatesLooking at Goldman Sachs’ estimates, an EBIT margin of 0.2% is believed to be attainable for Homes by FY24 through a substantial scale-down on all operating expenses.However, I believe that such estimates are too optimistic, and do not accurately reflect the high level of variable costs in the cost structure of this home-flipping business. By buying and selling individual houses off the market, Zillow’s cost of revenue represents the cost of acquiring houses and renovation expenses incurred to ensure that the homes are in good conditions for resale. Cost of revenue remains unlikely to be compressed with scale in a highly commoditized housing market and gross margins are expected to linger low between the 3.5% to 5% region. A small improvement in gross margin can be accounted for if Zillow manages to improve contract terms on its renovation costs with large contractors, but renovation costs remains a small percentage (~6%) of total cost of revenue.Next, sales and marketing expenses comprises of holdings costs (insurance, utilities, maintenance fees), agent commissions (revenue recognized by agents who connect home sellers to Zillow Offers), title and escrow fees and marketing costs. Among these, all costs except for marketing expenses are incurred on a per house basis, and they are unlikely to be significantly lowered even if Zillow increases with scale.Furthermore, R&D and G&A expenses are very conservatively projected to scale down to only ~1.0% of revenue, which may not hold true.Source: Own estimates (FY24)If FY24 cost of revenue and S&M expenses are to be projected on more reasonable terms in line with the aforementioned reasons, an operating margin of negative ~4.5% can be expected. Essentially, it is highly unlikely that Zillow can substantially improve profitability through operating leverage and economies of scale due to a low percentage of fixed costs in its cost structure.Source: Company FilingsBy ramping up home transactions, Zillow has been amassing an increasing inventory of houses which are largely financed by drawdowns on its revolving credit facilities (~83% in FY19). In fact, Zillow was required to negotiate 2 more credit facilities to triple its maximum borrowing capacity to $1.5bn in 2019. Interest expense of $30m on the credit facilities also caused an additional 220bps divergence between EBIT margin and pretax margin for the segment.The 3 credit facilities have maturity dates ranging from late 2021 to early 2022, and this presents additional risk. If Zillow were to retain high outstanding borrowings on them close to their maturity dates, this could lead to internal pressure to increase short-term liquidity causing them to sell off existing homes on their balance sheet at a discount. While this may not necessarily occur, investors should be wary of the possibility and scrutinize reported margins closer to the repayment dates.Source: Own estimatesBased on management’s target of 60,000 houses by ~FY23, I have forecasted inventory increase over the next 5 years, assuming Zillow becomes more efficient as selling houses. Inventory is modelled to increase to a peak of about ~11k as Zillow enters more markets in the US. Assuming that Zillow finances inventory with the same ~83% of credit (reasonable given that the company is OCF negative), it is likely the company would require close to $3b of financing through revolving credit facilities. This further exposes the company to high interest expenses, holding costs and the possibility of inventory write-downs in the event of a housing market correction.Source: My estimatesSource: Projected based on GS estimatesNext, even though Zillow is projected to improve profitability to an EBIT margin of negative 4.5% by FY24, they would still incur huge accumulated net losses over the next 5 years, especially since the company is aggressively pushing for top-line growth. Over the next 5 years, over $6.3b net losses is expected, which will deplete all of Zillow’s cash at hand. Even if GS’s bullish estimates of 0.2% EBIT margin by FY24 is to be used, projecting a linear improvement in margins, this would still amount to a significant $4.1b of net losses.Source: Own estimates, Zillow Cash and Cash Equivalents Source: Own estimates, based on 7.9% interest rate on additional LT debtBased on my projections, the company's cash balance will be negative by FY21, and Zillow will be required to issue further long-term debt to maintain a positive cash balance. Assuming a ~7.9% interest rate on additional debt (the average effective interest rate on two convertible notes issued in 2019), this will result in significant interest expense over the next 5 years. Moreover, this is already a conservative estimate as interest rates charged on additional notes will likely be much higher than the conservatively estimated 7.9% as Zillow becomes more highly leveraged.Source: Own estimatesOver the next 5 years, the consolidated impact of the capital-intensive business model and accumulated net losses will likely significantly increase Zillow's leverage and interest payments. As seen between 2021 and 2024, much of the increase in interest expense is attributable to the additional credit facilities and LT debt that Zillow will likely undertake if it expands according to plan.Source: Own estimatesWhile the company's EBIT margin is likely to improve over the next 5 years as Zillow benefits slightly from scale and potentially increase its operating efficiency, I believe that the improved profitability will likely be offset by the increase in interest expense from financing this highly capital intensive business segment. Given how debt is heavily incorporated into Zillow's business model, a more accurate and representative metric to look at would be profit before tax, which seems far from turning positive.Source: Company FilingsSource: Own calculationsAdditionally, Zillow has ~$2b of outstanding convertible notes maturing between 2020 to 2026. Given how highly cash-strapped Zillow is, outstanding notes will likely be converted to equity which could lead to a 14% dilution of shares outstanding.To sum it up, Zillow’s aggressive expansion plans in a bid to capture a larger market share and drive top-line growth may seem like an extremely exciting prospect. However, a closer look into the unit economics of the business raises concerns over the potential to turn this into a profit-making business. Moreover, the company's need to maintain high levels of inventory and leverage suggests that better investments with much more favourable risk-reward ratios can be sought after elsewhere.Pre-Covid-19, I would have seriously considered shorting the stock near its all-time high of $66.96. Considering how its share price has fallen to $21.05 at the point of writing this article, it's best to see how the markets play out before making a move. Assuming the market reverts back to normal once we see some form of containment of the virus, investors can pay closer attention to Zillow's quarterly margins (which have been declining) and its debt financing capability as potential catalysts for a short."

The websites have your usual bells and whistles such data on ranges of home prices, pictures, etc. The company operates multiple brands such as Zillow, Trulia, Mortgage Lenders of America, StreetEasy, HotPads, Naked Apartments, RealEstate.com, and Out East. These websites basically convert views into sales leads for real estate agents, and the company monetizes those leads in a variety of ways. This basically represents the Internet, Media and Technology (""IMT"") division of the company.Source: Zillow Group Investor Presentation November 2018IMT segment revenue is generated from the sale of advertising services and marketing software and technology solutions to real estate agencies and other professionals. The four revenue categories within the IMT segment are Premier Agent, Rentals, Mortgages and Other. Premier Agent, Rentals and Mortgages are mostly advertising revenue sold to agents, property rental offices, and mortgage lenders on a cost per impression/cost per lead basis. The other segment of the business focuses on technology solutions and is a much smaller portion of the business roughly 13% of revenue in 2018. It's somewhat disappointing to me that the technology solutions portion of the business is such a small portion of the business as the company spends so much on Technology and Development (390 million in 2018 for the IMT segment and 352 million in the 9 months in 2019 total).Source: Zillow 2018 10-KFor all intents and purposes, I consider the Premier Agent, Rentals and Mortgages to be virtually identical and representing the mature advertising related business. Looking over at similarweb at the company's analytics, I can see the company is doing reasonably well. The real estate listing website space is fairly crowded and, in my view, entrenched companies would have really good economies of scale.Source: Top Real Estate Websites in the worldGiven that the company is already at scale when it comes to the platform as a software/advertising business, it came as a surprise to me that the IMT segment is still unprofitable. A software platform business has been around for a few years now, so the costs of technology and development should be decreasing as the company slowly shifts to maintaining the existing technology (vs. needing to program more features). Sales and marketing expenses for the IMT segment is also unusually high for a tech firm at 534 million, close to 42% of segment revenue. This would be understandable if Zillow is an enterprise software company and you need a sales team to close big clients, but for a platform company, this is truly baffling to me. The main point of owning a platform is the ability to properly scale (thus using economies of scale to reduce operating expenses), at this point, Zillow is already among the top real estate websites for consumers and should be a cash-generating business.My guess is that the availability of other platforms such as craigslist and other dedicated real estate websites makes it hard for Zillow to charge real estate agents to be on the company's platform since it also needs those same agents on the platform to attract views.Source: Zillow 2018 10-K, author emphasisBeginning in April 2018, Zillow Offers provides started buying homes in certain metropolitan areas using its own capital. When Zillow buys a home, it makes certain repairs and lists the home for resale on the open market. The company also started originating residential mortgages to consumers through its newly acquired subsidiary Mortgage Lenders of America. The company hopes to capture the difference between what it buys the home for and what it resells at the open market. Buy low, fix it up a bit, then flip it. Fundamentally, it is no different than being a house flipper (and a bank, given that it also does mortgage origination).This pivot is a bad idea. Historically, Zillow has been a technology firm with its focus on building a technology platform. Now, it is moving away from being a tech firm to being a Real Estate Asset firm. The keys to success as a Real Estate asset firm are completely different from that of a tech firm and Zillow has no competitive advantage in this space. In order to succeed as Real Estate firm, Zillow would need to 1) properly assess and buy houses at the right price (below market value and covering any repair costs) as well as 2) have the operational capability to properly conduct the necessary repairs and manage a portfolio of houses.Zillow says it is targeting a 1.5 percent profit margin on every house sold. That is a very small margin of error, and Zillow needs to sell its homes quickly to limit the amount of time it's on the hook for mortgage payments, home-ownership-association fees, and insurance premiums. Zillow would also have to manage risk among its portfolio of houses as it would take some time to offload those assets. Finally, rational homeowners would probably do some sort of price comparison between Zillow, its start-up competitors, and traditional real-estate brokers leading to a more efficient market at the end of the day.Source: BloombergEven assuming that Zillow has somehow developed an advanced predictive algorithm to properly buy houses and can outsource repairs and management to a well-run partner, Zillow's expansion efforts for this business would still be constrained by capital requirements. Unlike software that you develop once then can sell an infinite amount of copies, Zillow can only buy and sell as many houses as its balance sheet can manage. Based on the company's 2019 3Q 10-Q, the company has about 2.3 billion cash on hand, a portion of it financed with long-term debt (total debt of 1.4 billion). This means the company has enough ""dry powder"" to execute its strategy but one has got to wonder if the juice (low-profit margins and operational risk) is worth the squeeze.It's hard to do a valuation when you don't agree with the company's strategy. But let's assume I am some big-shot hedge fund, and I can take a controlling activist position in Zillow, how much would I pay? Well, first I would completely halt Zillow Offers, return capital back to shareholders and bring down IMT related expenses to a reasonable level. The IMT segment has 1.3 billion in revenue in 2018, assuming with my business prowess, I am able to raise net income margin to 25-30% that's roughly 325 million to 390 million in net income.At 198 million shares outstanding and a P/E of 15 that translates to a share price target of 24.6-29.5 which is well below its current stock price. I wouldn't short Zillow as the company still has a lot of cash it can burn and hype can carry the stock to new highs, but this is an easy avoid for me."
4306580,105372,2019-11-14T09:31:06-05:00,"Zillow continues to achieve rapid growth but is yet to prove the unit economics of its iBuying business model.Zillow’s Internet, Media and Technology segment is performing strongly and will continue to be the primary contributor to Zillow’s bottom line in the short term.Zillow’s share price remains modest given the large market opportunity and Zillow’s dominant position in lead generation.","Zillow's (Z) latest earnings show that the company is progressing quickly towards its goal of utilizing technology to mechanize real estate transactions and offer integrated services to help people buy, sell, rent and finance property. While robust growth demonstrates that there is strong demand for Zillow's services, they are yet to prove the economics of their iBuying business. Investors should take some confidence from Zillow's continued ability to meet or exceed guidance for growth and profitability though, as Zillow's ability to transition from operating a technology platform to managing a business based around physical services is as big an unknown as the business model.Zillow's growth is being driven by the expansion of its Homes service across the United States and the company remains on track to meet its goal of Homes generating $20 billion of revenue annually in the next 3-5 years.Figure 1: Zillow Revenue Growth(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Zillow recognizes all of the revenue when it sells a home as they purchase the home and bear inventory risk. This accounting treatment reflects the economic reality of their services and is important for understanding the low margin nature of the business and the risk it entails. It is also somewhat misleading as Zillow takes a small portion of this total revenue, which on average is fairly consistent, as a fee for performing their iBuying service. Viewing iBuying transactions on a net revenue basis downplays the low margin high risk nature of the business but gives better insight into how much revenue actually flows through to Zillow.On a net revenue basis Zillow is achieving a relatively high growth rate, albeit much lower than on a gross revenue basis. This better reflects the reality that even if the iBuying business model is successful Zillow's bottom line will grow at a much slower rate than the top line due to the low margin nature of the business.Figure 2: Zillow Net Revenue Growth(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Zillow's gross margins continue to contract rapidly as the iBuying business grows, despite this operating margin's are improving as a result of operating leverage and improved performance of the Internet, Media and Technology (NYSE:IMT) business.Figure 3: Zillow Profit Margins(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Figure 4: Zillow Adjusted Profit Margins(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Zillow is exhibiting significant operating leverage as its iBuying business scales, but this is deceptive as only a small percentage of iBuying revenue will ever flow through to the business to cover operating expenses.Figure 5: Zillow Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Viewing operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue Zillow is not exhibiting operating leverage.Figure 6: Zillow Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Net Revenue(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Zillow's Homes segment is now the largest on a gross revenue basis. On a net revenue basis IMT remains the largest segment and by far has the largest ability to contribute to Zillow's bottom line.Figure 7: Zillow Segment Revenue(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Figure 8: Zillow Segment Net Revenue(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)The real value of Zillow's expansion into iBuying comes from the ability to offer integrated services, in particular higher margin services like mortgage brokerage. For example, Zillow Homes can buy a home from someone moving cities, refer them to a premier agent, approve them for a home loan through Zillow Home Loans and perform closing services.Zillow's IMT segment is broken into Premier Agent, Rental and other services. Revenue is generated through advertising as well as offering a suite of marketing and business technology products and services to help real estate agents and brokers. Zillow is aiming to expand IMT revenue to $2 billion annually in the next 3-5 years, primarily by more effectively monetizing leads by prioritizing quality over quantity.Table 1: Zillow IMT Segment Performance(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Premier AgentPremier Agent revenue is generated by the sale of advertising services, as well as marketing and technology products and services, to help real estate agents and brokers grow and manage their businesses. Growth in the Premier Agent business has declined in recent years as the business matured but appears to be reaccelerating. It is unclear if this is a result of improvements implemented in the business or if there is positive spillover from Homes. Agent retention has risen year over year with both customer and agent satisfaction also improved as a result of Zillow implementing enhancements to their services.Zillow is currently testing a Flex pricing model for Premier Agent and Premier Broker advertising services in limited markets. Under the Flex model impressions and connections are provided upfront and costs only incurred when a real estate transaction is closed with one of those leads. The timeline for real estate transactions can vary significantly and Zillow is therefore testing this model to understand the financial implications before making a decision as to whether to expand it. Flex tests including Phoenix and Atlanta are expected to represent only 5% of Premier Agent revenue in 2019.RentalRental revenue includes advertising sold to rental professionals on a cost per lead, cost per click, cost per lease or cost per listing basis. Rentals revenue also includes revenue generated through rental application products, where potential renters can submit applications to multiple properties over a 30-day period for a flat service fee.OtherOther revenue includes revenue generated by new construction advertising and the sale of business technology solutions for real estate professionals. New construction revenue primarily includes advertising services sold to home builders on a cost per residential community basis.Table 2: Zillow IMT Revenue Breakdown(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Figure 9: Zillow Unique Website Visitors(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)The Homes segment includes Zillow's Offers service where homes are purchased and sold directly by Zillow. Zillow continues to expand their iBuying program aggressively and now have a presence in 21 markets, with 8 new markets added in Q3 2019.Table 3: Zillow Homes Segment Performance(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Figure 10: Zillow Homes Markets(source: Zillow)The Homes segment is yet to achieve profitability and currently has negative unit economics. Despite continued deterioration in margins as the business grows, profitability is within the range given by Zillow as a target when they first launched the service and management still expect to achieve 2-3% margins once the business has scaled.Figure 11: Zillow iBuying Revenue per Home and Profitability(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)At this stage it appears management is focused on scaling the business and is not too focused on profitability. Zillow is yet to show an ability to reduce any of the expenses associated with iBuying which is potentially a concern. Zillow does not provide any information on how iBuying markets perform over time as they mature or the variation in iBuying performance between different markets and it is therefore uncertain how this business will perform in the long run.Figure 12: Zillow iBuying Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Zillow received more than 80,000 homeowner requests for an iBuying offer in Q3 of 2019, most of which came through Zillow owned and earned channels. This highlights the strong demand for the service and Zillow's dominant position in lead generation. During Q3 2019 Zillow sold 1,211 homes, purchased 2,291 homes and ended the quarter with 2,822 homes in inventory. At the current rate of sales, it would therefore take Zillow approximately 212 days to turnover their inventory.Inventory is a threat to the iBuying business model as there is potential for a large write-down in the event of a real estate market downturn and slow inventory turnover results in large financing costs. Interest expense is a significant component of iBuying expenses and achieving rapid inventory turnover is crucial to the success and risk of the business.Figure 13: Zillow Cash Conversion Cycle(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)It should be noted that homes in inventory are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, they are not marked to market. Under normal circumstances homes should be expected to increase in value over time, but any increase in value cannot be recognized by Zillow. Conversely in circumstances where the value of a home is believed to have decreased Zillow must recognize the loss.Zillow recently launched closing services in a handful of markets, which is one of their first forays into adjacent services. Closing services consists of ensuring the title to a piece of real estate is legitimate, issuing title insurance for the property, maintaining escrow accounts and ensuring documents are filed with the appropriate entities. Although there is no data on how this service is performing management has stated they are encouraged by the early consumer signals they have received and that this reinforces their belief in the value of bundling multiple services around each real estate transaction.Mortgages segment revenue is generated from advertising sold to mortgage professionals on a cost per lead or subscription basis, through mortgage originations and the related sale of mortgages on the secondary market and from Mortech, which provides subscription-based mortgage software solutions.Mortgages is an adjacent service to iBuying which could be bundled with iBuying services, although Zillow is yet to prove they can do this. Mortgages revenue has been relatively flat in recent periods but this is a service Zillow clearly wants to expand with recent leadership additions adding experience in consumer lending and capital markets.Table 4: Zillow Mortgages Segment Performance(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Zillow's management expects the Homes segment to achieve strong growth in the next quarter, despite seasonal weakness. Margins are expected to be lower across all segments.Table 5: Zillow Q4 2019 Guidance(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Zillow's valuation remains dependent on the success of their iBuying business and their ability to successfully offer a wide range of higher margin adjacent services, both of which remain uncertain. Zillow continues to make rapid progress toward its goal though and I believe will likely be successful. Based on a discounted cash flow analysis I estimate an intrinsic value for Zillow of approximately $65 per share. To achieve this valuation Zillow must continue to expand its iBuying service, create positive unit economics on home sales and show an improved ability to provide adjacent services."
4294452,78545,2019-10-01T16:59:38-04:00,"Zillow, Redfin, and Opendoor are all looking to improve the archaic buying experience in real estate through iBuying and offering adjacent products.Zillow’s primary strength lies in its ownership of the customer relationship, which will translate into lower customer acquisition cost on both the buying and the selling of homes.The unit economics remain unproven but Zillow has outlined a path to 2-3% adj. EBITDA margins. If successful, Zillow could more than double its adj. EBITDA.Zillow’s most significant risk in the near-term is the large amount of change underway at both its new and core businesses. These changes, and the resulting guidance revisions that could come, have weighed on the stock.","Source: Yehua YangZillow (Z) sits at a transformational moment in its history. Historically an ad business that connected buyers to agents, Zillow is in the early innings of a pivot to a one-stop shop for real estate. This pivot involves getting into the nascent iBuyer industry, a controversial business model that could either upend the real estate industry or blow up, as well as making significant changes to its existing ad business. Zillow is also building ancillary businesses in mortgages, title insurance, and other adjacencies.As many have noted, these changes all present a significant amount of risk in the near-term for the business. A look at recent performance hints at this, with Zillow stock down over 40% since 2Q19 earnings.At the same time, it's also potentially a huge opportunity. Zillow and numerous other real estate companies are racing toward the finish line - an all-digital, seamless home purchasing experience. And while now might not present the best entrance given a rocky near-term outlook, I believe Zillow is well-positioned to succeed in this industry longer-term. It’s helpful to first take a step back and look at how the buying experience in other industries has radically changed with the advent of the internet. Amazon made the purchasing process so seamless that a shopper can now find a toilet, order it with a click, and have it at his/her doorstep in two days. Similar experiences can be seen in buying a car (Tesla (TSLA), Carvana (CVNA)), ordering takeout (Grubhub (GRUB), DoorDash), meeting someone (Tinder (MTCH)), and getting somewhere (Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT)). Customers have been trained to open an app and press a button to get what they want.Buying a home is one of the few areas today that has not moved in that direction. While companies like Zillow have made it easier to find home listings and get more information about it, you’re immediately moved away from Zillow and into the old-school real estate world once you’re ready to see it in person. The process then involves painful home tours, negotiations on price and potential repairs, inspections, paperwork, title insurance, more paperwork, and escrow. And at the end, the buyer and seller each pay a hefty 3% to brokers for their help in the process.Numerous real estate companies are now racing to streamline and digitize the home buying process. The three companies I’ll focus my discussion on here are Zillow, Redfin (RDFN), and OpenDoor, but note that there are other iBuyers and real estate brokerages that are focused on this problem as well. The approach to take on more of a customer’s pain points can be seen in Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman’s comments from their 4Q18 conference call (emphasis mine):Each company is starting at a different point in the home buying process, which naturally creates both opportunities and weaknesses relative to their competitors.Redfin. Redfin is a broker that uses technology to lower the cost of using an agent to buy or sell a home. Because their agents are 3x more productive than the average agent (due to the help they get from technology), and are salaried employees rather than independent contractors paid on commission, Redfin is able to charge 1% to 1.5% to the home seller compared to the 2.5% to 3% that is typically charged. This presents a compelling value proposition to a seller as they save thousands more by going with a Redfin agent. For buyers, Redfin offers savings as well as a superior buying experience with on-demand tour scheduling and more data to inform bids.As an agent, Redfin already has a hand in many real estate transactions without any of the inventory risk that an iBuyer might have. In 2Q19, Redfin was involved in almost 19,000 real estate transactions, representing almost $9 billion in gross real estate dollars, and almost 1% of the total market. This is less than other larger real estate brokers, but the larger brokers are not using tech to the same degree to increase broker productivity. It’s also much higher than the number of transactions Opendoor or Zillow directly touch. Given how close Redfin is to the transaction, they are also expanding into adjacent products like mortgages and title insurance to offer a more streamlined purchasing process (as highlighted in the CEO’s comments above). With a value proposition focused on cost, Redfin has spent much of its resources bringing down broker fees with various products. For example, the company offers Redfin Direct, a tool that helps buyers make an offer on a home without a broker or a broker fee. Additionally, Redfin has automated home tour scheduling, which speeds up the time a consumer can see a home and reduces broker time spent emailing with clients. Redfin still largely uses brokers to help close on homes, but their offerings make it clear that the company is aiming to reduce the friction in buying a home with an eventual goal of all-digital home closings.It should also be noted that Redfin is involved in iBuying with Redfin Now, but the scope and scale of the program is much smaller than the other iBuyers. In fact, CEO Glenn Kelman has noted some skepticism around the unproven economics of the model during their 2Q19 earnings conference call:With that said, Redfin is not ignoring the iBuying business - just being extra cautious. Redfin currently has a partnership with Opendoor in place where they hand over demand that they cannot fill. Additionally, Redfin is looking to grow Redfin Now more rapidly going forward. The company expect $70M from Redfin Now in 3Q alone vs. the $60M that they generated in the first half of the year.  While their strength is in their proximity to the transaction, they are weaker at the top of the sales funnel where there is less awareness of Redfin. The company’s 37 million unique visitors per month is nothing to sneeze at, but it’s small compared to Zillow’s roughly 200 million monthly unique visitors. For this reason, one of Redfin’s primary initiatives recently has to been to raise awareness of the company by increasing its marketing spend. Redfin is expected to grow marketing spend from $44M in 2018 to $81M this year in an effort to educate more people about Redfin. The effectiveness of the marketing spend, and the amount of time until the benefits are seen, are key debates for the stock currently among institutional investors.Note Redfin’s weakness is not just in awareness, but also in conveying a more complex message. While one would think that generating $12,000 in savings for each sellers is a simple message to convey to consumers, it can be made more difficult due to the fact that many consumers are not even aware that brokers will charge a listing and buyer fee.Additionally, Redfin must balance sending a conflicting message as both an iBuyer (albeit a small one currently) and an agent. When a seller comes to Redfin for an iBuyer quote, they will likely get a conservatively priced quote on their home. If the seller chooses not to accept Redfin’s offer (presumably because the offer is too low), then Redfin must still convince the seller to use them as their broker, even though they priced the home at a lower rate than what the owner thinks it’s worth.Lastly, there are some questions around Redfin’s moat. The company relies on technology and local expertise with its salaried brokers. At some point, you have to imagine that Zillow and Opendoor will compete more directly with Redfin by aiming to eliminate brokers as well. And while each market brings unique nuances and legal challenges, it seems like a solvable issue for a well-capitalized real estate company.If you believe that iBuying might not work out to be a profitable business, Redfin might not be a bad business to invest in given that they are entering the space more cautiously, but still looking to change the customer buying experience with a more seamless agent experience. The company currently offers full digital closings in several markets, and will continue to work to make it more seamless and available in more markets.Opendoor. Started in 2014, Opendoor was the first company to begin the iBuying category. Today, the company is the largest iBuyer on the market with about 11,000 homes bought and 7,000 homes sold in 2018. The company aims to execute over 30,000 transactions in total for 2019.As the largest and longest standing iBuyer, the company is probably the furthest along in proving the economics in the iBuyer business model. Opendoor began in Phoenix and Dallas, where homes are relatively standardized and easy to value. The company charges a 6-13% fee (when buying the home), performs renovations, and quickly prepares the home to be sold, aiming to hold the home for 90 days or less. Zillow and other iBuyers have largely followed these moves and have similar objectives.Opendoor also allows potential home buyers to tour a home without an agent present. This is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it significantly reduces one of the most expensive parts of selling a home - the touring. Agents can easily spend an entire day showing potential buyers homes without any guarantee that the potential buyer will move further with a home. Redfin has called this out as a particularly difficult part of the buying process, as they have noted that buyers have become increasingly casual about seeing a home. By allowing consumers to tour a home without an agent present, Opendoor bypasses these issues and allows for a greater volume of potential buyers to see a home. On the other hand, Opendoor’s policy also has presented PR issues where potential buyers have found squatters and drug users in the homes. While the actual prevalence of these issues is unknown, it does harm the reputation of the company and the customer experience.Like Redfin and Zillow, Opendoor has also recognized the importance of offering a complete solution. In recent months, the company has acquired/launched a mortgage, title, and escrow business.While Opendoor’s strength is in its iBuying from sellers, they likely spend more on finding buyers than Zillow or Redfin, since OpenDoor doesn’t have the same level of traffic and customer awareness as Zillow does. Additionally, their ability to price each home accurately is going to be crucial given the volumes that they are buying and selling the homes, and I wonder whether they will be able to do so given that they don’t have access to as much data as Redfin or Zillow.Before getting into Zillow’s strategic advantages in iBuying, we should first talk about why Zillow has decided to move into the space.The best strategic article that I would recommend reading is Stratechery's views on Zillow and OpenDoor. Ben's articles on Opendoor actually influenced Zillow's decision to move into the iBuying industry. In sum, the article discusses Zillow's place as an aggregator of sorts, akin to other powerful aggregators like Facebook, Netflix, or AirBnB. However, up to this point, it had served as a weaker version of one. Zillow serves ads for agents that help facilitate the transaction, but they are completely removed from the transaction. This has limited Zillow's ability to change the industry, and up to this point, has largely limited Zillow's total addressable market as well.Indeed, Zillow's PA business had also begun to slow, and questions were beginning to arise around its long-term growth trajectory. I'll discuss this in more detail later.This was likely one impetus for Zillow to move into iBuying last year, which has been detailed numerous places elsewhere. In short, Zillow is getting into the business of buying and selling homes. This move allows Zillow to get involved in the transaction itself and actually disrupt the real estate industry, as opposed to simply facilitating the connection of buyers to brokers.The surface level reaction to this has been largely negative. This move means that Zillow will transition from a capital-light, high margin business to a capital-intensive, low margin business. Zillow will hold the inventory risk at a time when the housing market is showing signs of slowing, and 10 years after the last recession.But it's important to note that there is a huge amount of upside as well. By getting closer to the transaction, Zillow drastically increases its revenue opportunities. There’s an estimated $1.8 trillion in home transactions each year compared to the $17 billion tied to home advertising (their core business).  Source: Zillow 8K Filing on April 12, 2018Numerous other companies have made similar transitions in their own ways. For example, Yelp has been in a multi-year attempt to move closer to the transaction as opposed to simply serving ads on behalf of local businesses at the top of the funnel.This is a particularly good example as Yelp has struggled to move down funnel where they have met stronger competition from the likes of Grubhub, Doordash, Opentable, and others. These companies have integrated other aspects of the business to provide a better customer experience than Yelp. Yelp has been largely confined to the top of the funnel as a result.The key here is whether Zillow can flex its power as the starting point for buyers looking for a home. With >200M unique visitors per month on their site, Zillow is now known as the Google for real estate, and the starting point for a customer’s home buying journey. Can Zillow better serve these visitors as they get closer to the transaction, or are competitors like Redfin, a tech-enabled broker, or OpenDoor, an iBuyer-focused company, better positioned?Let’s start first with Zillow’s iBuying approach. Potential sellers go onto Zillow and request a quote for their home. A Zillow employee then contacts the seller and gets information and photos about the home. This information is then used by Zillow, along with a local real estate agent performing a market analysis, to then come up with an offer for the home. Zillow then presents this offer, the market analysis, and other instant offers from third parties, to the seller within a few days. While the average fee that Zillow charges is 7%, the fee can vary from 6% to 9%, depending on how quickly they believe they can sell the home. While seemingly expensive, note that sellers currently pay about 6% (or more, if you include other fees) to brokers when selling their home.If the seller selects Zillow’s offer, they sign a letter of intent and Zillow sends an inspector to the home to perform a more detailed analysis. The price is adjusted based on what the inspector finds, and the home moves towards closing. Once closed, Zillow will perform any necessary renovations and prepare the market for resale on its own platform and other websites. The goal is to hold the home for less than 90 days.Management hopes that the unit economics of each transaction begins to scale with time. In the near-term, they’ve stated that they hope to break even on the sale of each home, but that over time, they expect to achieve a 4-5% return on homes before interest expense and corp. overhead, and a 2-3% adj. EBITDA margin after stripping out corporate overhead. As the image below highlights, management sees upside to returns from a variety of sources, including scale efficiencies and shorter holding periods (for the return before corp. overhead) and adjacent cross-selling opportunities in title & escrow, insurance, mortgages, and other streams (for the return after corp. overhead).Source: 1Q19 Shareholder LetterNote that what Zillow is doing here is not necessary flipping homes as many people think of it. Zillow is not looking to make major renovations and profit significantly on price appreciation (although this is one component of the expected profit). The key here is volumes - Zillow wants to hold the homes for shorter time periods and cross-sell more products and services to buyers. To succeed, Zillow will have to:It’s sometimes difficult to frame the IT risk of building new, complex technological tools. But note that the timeline for Zillow’s mortgage business was just recently pushed back as it was taking longer than expected to build the systems out.As investors have been quick to note, and management readily admits, Homes is a high volume, low margin business. But the quick math on management’s targets would suggest a $400M adj. EBITDA opportunity (on $20B in annual sales and a 2% adj. EBITDA margin) before giving them credit for potential sources of upside. For context, Zillow reported $200M of adj. EBITDA in 2018. If Zillow succeeds, they would more than double the size of their profits.In my opinion, Zillow looks well-positioned on paper to execute on this complex business. With its industry-leading traffic and customer awareness, Zillow should have very low customer acquisition costs on both the purchase and the sale of each home, especially compared to competitors that struggle at the top of the funnel. They should also be well-positioned to cross-sell customers onto adjacent businesses for similar reasons.Additionally, Zillow has access to a treasure trove of data on each real estate property. In theory, Zillow can use this data to price homes better than competitors and to stay ahead of a potential housing downturn.How successful has Zillow been so far? From a volume perspective, the company has moved much more rapidly down funnel than the street’s expectations. The company has bought and sold much more in volume than the street has expected essentially since the segment began. Last quarter for example, Zillow bought 1,535 homes and sold 786 compared to expectations of 1,178 and 772, respectively. And the street expects growth to continue in 3Q and 4Q. In terms of economics, the company has been roughly on pace and moving in the right direction. Today, the return on homes is -2% to 2% compared to the 4-5% goal that they have at scale. And in terms of overall operating margins, inclusive of corporate overhead, their adj. EBITDA margin is currently at -23%. As would be expected, this is a ways away from profitability as the company is still investing in the infrastructure without any of the scale that they hope to ultimately achieve. However, it is moving in the right direction from prior quarters. This is an exciting strategy for the company, and as they continue to build out this business, Zillow will likely find more ways to monetize the business and add value to the ecosystem. As the starting point for people looking to buy or sell a home, Zillow owns the customer relationship, which gives them a variety of advantages as they scale their iBuyer business. However, those with advantages on paper do not always win out. Zillow will need to execute and find enough areas to scale and generate margin.In this regard, management is well-received by the street and appears to be the right people at the helm to lead this shift. Rich Barton recently returned to lead Zillow as CEO earlier this year; he previously served as Zillow CEO from 2005 to 2010. Mr. Barton has also been extensively involved in other marketplaces - he founded Expedia and Glassdoor, served as a partner at Benchmark (a VC that has invested in numerous successful marketplaces), and served on the board of Netflix. The Homes segment is headed by Arik Prawer, a former Chief Integration Officer at Invitation Homes (the largest single-family rental REIT in the US).There are a few risks that are often raised as Zillow aims to upend the industry.Too many balls in the air. In my mind, this represents the largest risk to the story, and explains the recent stock weakness. As if entering an entirely new, unproven business model is not enough, Zillow is also undergoing two significant changes in its core Premier Agent business.For background, Zillow’s core business up to this point has been as an ad platform. Zillow serves broker ads to site visitors interested in properties. Brokers were charged an upfront fee in exchange for buyer leads.  Source: Zillow More recently, over the last year or so, Zillow has introduced a new model for advertisers called PA4. As I had previously highlighted, the top of the funnel in real estate is a costly area as brokers spend a significant amount of time servicing clients that could back out of the buying process for any number of reasons. Zillow’s PA4 was meant to help make the top of the funnel more efficient with two changes. First, potential buyers were screened in order to ensure that only customers that were closer to being ready to purchase are connected to brokers. Second, Zillow only put these customers in touch with a broker that answered their phone (note that this was based off feedback that about half of customers were directed to brokers that did not pick up their phone). In theory, these moves made sense and would improve the experience for both buyers and agents.In practice, agents were largely unhappy with the changes and moved away from the platform. The increased buyer screening led to fewer leads for agents. While these leads were higher quality, agents felt as if the value was not there, as agents were paying the same amount and only getting 4 leads, as opposed to the 8 previously. Additionally, agents wanted both the high quality, low quantity leads, as well as the low quality, high quantity leads. Agents had been trained to nurture these relationships and develop them over time so that when they were ready to buy a home, the agent would be top of mind. In response, the company put into place PA4.1, which made some tweaks to give agents a mixture of the high quality, low quantity leads, as well as the low quality, high quantity leads. While the segment performance hasn’t exactly shined (see performance up to 2Q19 in the PA chart below), management has noted that advertising churn has begun to stabilize, and that feedback has improved.Just as PA4.1 was beginning to stabilize results, Zillow recently announced another major change to its advertising model with the expansion of Flex pricing during its 2Q19 earnings. This was the primary reason for the large stock drop. Flex pricing is a new mechanism that Zillow has been testing for some time. Rather than charging an upfront fee to brokers, flex pricing charges brokers only if a lead converts into a successful home purchase. This aligns Zillow’s incentives to match those of the customers, and moves the company closer to the transaction. Zillow also receives better economics per transaction (more revenue), according to Zillow’s tests, and it likely expands their addressable market as well given that brokers no longer have an ROI hurdle rate to consider before buying ads.The company announced that it would expand the test into 2 additional markets in 4Q to increase their learnings about the new pricing model. But as the program expands to additional markets, Zillow will also have to lower their revenue guidance. The reason is that the shift to Flex from an upfront fee is essentially moving revenue normally recognized from the start of a customer’s sales cycle (roughly six months in length) to the back of it. As a result, if Zillow continues to expand Flex, the company will likely have to continue to lower revenue guidance, as they did during their 2Q19 earnings. Consensus estimates currently do not model higher growth until 1Q2020. The key to Flex’s success is the conversion rate and the pricing. There is a conversion rate where Flex breaks even with the more traditional pricing model. An optimistic investor might imagine that management would not ultimately expand Flex more broadly until the economics work and the margin for error is significant enough.Ultimately, PA4.1 and Flex 1) creates near-term risk as the company works through any unexpected kinks, 2) diverts senior management focus and attention away from the Homes segment during its crucial ramp years, and 3) pushes more revenue into outer years, further increasing risk from an investor perspective. This was the primary reason that led me to sell my shares in Zillow. However, I do believe that they were the right longer-term moves for the company, and that Zillow will come out a stronger competitor from these decisions.Economic expansion, and housing gains are long in the tooth. The obvious risk is that now that Zillow is taking ownership of homes on their balance sheet, they could potentially be stuck with depreciating inventory if the market moves in the opposite direction. This is certainly a risk now that we are over 10 years removed from the last recession, and with housing prices up significantly from the bottom of the crash.However, there are two counterarguments to consider:Unproven business model. iBuying is significantly more prevalent today, but it still remains early days for the business model. Some challenges have surfaced, including dealing with renovations at scale, and navigating the top of the funnel in a cost efficient manner. It could be the case that iBuying may take longer to achieve profitability (i.e. 10 years), or it could just not be possible if consumers are not willing to give up tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for the convenience of going with an iBuyer. The model will also really be tested when the market takes a more serious downturn. The answer to this risk will be fleshed out over time as the industry matures and as Zillow gets closer to scale.This is a potentially disruptive company at a very early, early stage in its evolution. Its core business is undergoing two major shifts, the home business is not expected to reach scale for several more years, and the unit economics are not yet proven. Additionally, macro risks are heightened and Zillow also faces several near-term headwinds as they expand Flex.At the same time, Zillow management believes they have a path to profitable economics and several key strategic assets to make this work out. Namely, its ownership of the customer relationship is a huge advantage over competitors, and other marketplaces have historically done well in this position.My own view is that the near-term picture has enough downside risk to where I don’t think this is good timing to get involved in the story. However, I like the longer-term story, and I believe there’s a high chance that Zillow comes out on top over time.With that in mind, there’s three things I’d watch for before getting involved in the stock: 1) The numerous changes in PA stabilize and growth reaccelerates, 2) Homes transaction volumes continues to ramp towards management’s longer-term goal of 5,000 per month, and 3) Homes profitability (at both a unit level and an all-in level) continue to trend in the right direction.This article originally appeared on The Non-Consensus."
4284888,103480,2019-08-12T13:15:32-04:00,"Shares of Zillow dropped sharply after reporting Q2 results, despite beating Wall Street's expectations on both the top and bottom line.
        Investors balked at growing losses in the Homes segment (Zillow Offers), which essentially decimated all of the earnings of the flagship Premier Agent business.
        The company added seven Zillow Offers markets in Q2 and is planning four new markets for launch in early 2020.
        Despite greater overall losses, Zillow generated positive gross margins in its Homes segment this quarter, up from a loss last quarter and several points better than Redfin Now.
        On the Premier Agent side, the company noted that advertiser retention has ""returned to normal""","Zillow's (Z) powerful recovery this year has just been interrupted by the company's latest Q2 results. Despite reporting strong top-line growth (driven by Zillow Offers) as well as an earnings beat in spite of the losses generated by Zillow Offers, shares of Zillow have tanked more than 20% after reporting earnings. Investors continued to poke at their biggest point of contention with Zillow last year: the company's home-flipping losses.Defying the cold reaction from the markets since a year ago, Zillow has continued to push aggressively forward with Zillow Offers, opening seven new markets in Q2: Nashville, Fort Collins, Portland, Dallas-Fort Worth, Colorado Springs, Cincinnati, and Tucson. Management believes the company is driving toward a future state it calls ""Real Estate 2.0"" in which Zillow is guiding customers through the entire process of a purchase or sale, not simply referring agents to them anymore. Both Zillow and Redfin (RDFN) have made this tectonic shift in their business models over the past year (see my latest take on Redfin here), but I believe there's one key difference between the two online real estate giants. Both companies operate a primary business outside of Zillow Offers/Redfin Now, but in Zillow's case, that primary business is a highly profitable, rich-margin advertising and mortgage referral cash cow. Despite Zillow Offers' losses, the company's primary business has been able to cover that shortfall and keep Zillow at least EBITDA-neutral as we wait for Zillow Offers to scale into profitability. Zillow Offers is only one year old, after all; and in that short amount of time the business has grown to a $1 billion run rate. Like any startup, Zillow's focus in its Homes segment has been growth, with the expectation of profitability later.This is different from Redfin, whose primary business isn't online advertising - but a low-margin real estate brokerage. Redfin's policy of paying salaries instead of commissions to its real estate agents has hurt it in a period of cooling home sales (driven by high prices and low inventory), and the company's decision to cut sellers' agent fees to a mere 1% in many markets has hurt revenue growth in its brokerage segment. Unlike Zillow, Redfin's brokerage business isn't able to offset its losses in home-flipping. The bullish case on Zillow, in my view, remains sound. The Zillow portfolio includes some of the most powerful brands in online real estate that virtually every modern buyer or seller consults prior to a transaction, ensuring the stability of the company's cash-generating Premier Agent business. This business will continue to keep Zillow afloat as we wait for Zillow Offers to eventually turn a profit. Stay long here and buy the dip.Here's a look at Zillow's second-quarter results:Figure 1. Zillow 2Q19 earnings dataSource: Zillow 2Q19 earnings releaseTotal revenues grew 84% y/y to $599.6 million, comfortably beating Wall Street's expectations of $585.1 million (+80% y/y) by a four-point margin. Almost all of this growth, of course, was driven by the Homes segment, which grew to $248.9 million in revenues and hit just shy of a $1 billion annualized run rate. You'll note as well that the IMT segment, which houses Zillow's Premier Agent business, maintained its 6% y/y growth pace - the same as last quarter. The company continued to find traction with its Flex payment model for advertising agents, which allows them to pay a success fee to Zillow upon the completion of a sale instead of upfront. Note also that the expansion of the delayed-payments Flex model necessitates a push-out of revenue into future quarters, which is the primary driver behind Zillow's reduction in its IMT revenue guidance for the year. Zillow also noted in its shareholder letter that ""we were pleased to advertiser retention return to historic norms."" Recall that last year, around the same time that Zillow was building up Zillow Offers, the company experienced high advertiser churn in its Premier Agent business due to pricing changes. Now, the strength in this segment and the $64.1 million in adjusted EBITDA it generated was enough to offset the -$56.5 million of losses in Homes.The profitability of the Homes segment is the elephant in the room in any Zillow discussion, as Homes' losses has decimated Zillow's massive profitability in the year-ago quarter. Despite the ballooning of losses, it's useful to see Zillow's progress on a unit basis. This quarter, Zillow delivered gross returns of $1.2 million of Homes sales of $248.9 million (representing 786 total transactions in the quarter, and average of ~$317,000 per sale), representing a 50bps gross margin:Figure 2. Zillow Homes resultsSource: Zillow Q2 shareholder letterThis means that on average, Zillow is at least profiting off each sale without counting interest on the initial holding period. This is also a significant improvement from Q1, where Zillow generated a gross margin of -10bps on its Homes sales. And while a 50bps gross margin in this segment seems low, compare that to Redfin - which is generating a -2% margin.A business that's only a year old needs time to scale, and Redfin believes that it can hit 400-500bps of gross margin over the long term. At Redfin's current average sale price, this means a gross profit of approximately $16,000 per home, and at a $1 billion annualized run rate, this would generate $50 million of gross margin dollars for the company annually, while also generating tertiary benefits to Zillow's other businesses. Recall that the overall strategy for Zillow Offers isn't simply to turn a small profit on flipping homes, but also build a pipeline for fee-driven services in Zillow's mortgage and title businesses. Per the company's shareholder letter commentary:Zillow has reported that Zillow Mortgage Loans, a business that generates 3,000 loans per month, now has a 33% attach rate to homes sold on Zillow Offers. The company has also noted that it is moving inventory according to schedule (which is important as unsold homes create holding costs as well as interest expense). Per CFO Allen Parker's comments on the Q2 earnings call:In short, as Zillow Offers continues to expand (to a total of 26 U.S. markets by early next year), we are seeing evidence of increasing economies of scale and improving performance, despite many investors' view of the Homes segment as merely a cash pit.In my view, while the absolute dollar amount of Zillow Homes' losses may be staggering, we have to look at it in the context of prior periods and versus competitors. Zillow has made a 60bps improvement in Homes gross margins in a single quarter alone, and plans to deliver up to 450bps of further improvement over the medium to long term. We note as well that Zillow Offers' profitability is far higher at present than Redfin Now, and also has a highly profitable Premier Agent business to offset losses in Homes in the near term.Stay long on Zillow as it continues to reinvent itself."
4267270,103763,2019-05-30T10:17:56-04:00,"Zillow is attempting to take a slice of the country's home transaction value through Zillow Offers - a feat which we believe they have the potential to achieve.This new business model would force Zillow to cannibalize its current advertising business and absorb new, larger risks.Today, risks in the new segment are high, specifically in execution and macroeconomics - yet we believe these are manageable going forward.Fortunately, if Zillow is successful, the capital-intensive business endeavor could provide today’s shareholders with enticing returns.We see the risk-reward trade-off as positively skewed, making for a potentially attractive investment for patient, long-term shareholders.","Zillow (Z) has been in the business of providing real estate professionals (“REPs”) with lead generation and other marketing solutions. On the flip side, the platform has allowed homeowners to obtain Zestimates, forecast mortgage payments, and discover new homes.In 2017, Zillow piloted their Instant Offers program, which has since changed to Zillow Offers. The new segment allows homeowners to sell their homes to Zillow for cash. Zillow then turns around, and sells the home on the open market. There are plenty of questions regarding the viability of the business model, how lucrative the opportunity is, and the risks which come with it.Source: ZillowWe believe the demand for such a service is currently underappreciated, and believe Zillow is one of the best-positioned companies to capitalize on the opportunity. As the process is refined, we believe adoption of this new transaction method stands to accelerate.Going forward, we can envision a world where Zillow has successfully streamlined the home buying and selling process, capturing a healthy portion of home transaction value in the U.S. After factoring in risks, which we see as manageable, we believe the upside is much greater than the downside, making a potential investment attractive to us.In 2018, ~6 million homes were sold in the U.S., with new and existing homes selling for a median price of ~$326,000 and ~$257,000, respectively. The majority (~90%) of homes sold were existing homes, while the remaining amount (~10%) were new home sales. On a weighted basis, the average home sold for ~$260,000.Source: U.S. Census BureauCollectively, home transaction value was over $1.5 trillion. Assuming industry standard commissions of ~6% per transaction, domestic revenues from commissions were nearly $100 billion.Source: Google TrendsAs you can see, since Zillow’s inception in 2004, their popularity has risen considerably. Other firms, such as Redfin and Trulia (a Zillow subsidiary), are trailing behind when it comes to user search queries on the internet.Source: SEC Filings (QuickFS)When it comes to customer demand, a look at the firm’s revenue speaks for their success. Total revenue has grown at an average rate of 64% per year since 2009, totaling over $1.3 billion in 2018. Zillow generates revenue by providing advertising and lead generation for REPs.For quite some time now, we have seen the middleman being cut out of the equation as certain industries undergo digitization. The digitization of real estate transactions have been a hot topic for some time. Zillow, through Zillow Offers, is attempting to break into this space. Leveraging their extensive network of housing data, they have begun to purchase homes from sellers, polish the homes up, and then resell the homes on the open market – akin to a market maker.Source: ZillowSince its launch, the service has received some criticism (more on this later), although the numbers show there is some willingness on the homeowner’s behalf to try out this transaction method. In the same press release, it was noted that Zillow Offers has been seeing demand which represents over $200 million in transaction value per day. On an annualized basis, this would equate to ~$73 billion in transaction value – just over 4% of the country’s home transaction value in 2018. This would also reflect total purchase volume of over 280,000 homes per year (23,000 per month).Source: ZillowIt’s clear that Zillow Offers is garnering interest among homeowners, although whether their business model is viable on a large scale is questionable in the eyes of many. After all, cutting out real estate agents would essentially kill their current business - this is where things get tricky.Source: Google TrendsOn top of this, another big question is: how would such a conservative industry undergo digitization? Ben Thompson, from Stratechery, highlighted the various factors home buyers and sellers would be considering prior to a transaction taking place. Thompson notes that for individuals, these transactions are rare – many would be willing to deal with the hassle since they’re likely only doing it a handful of times in their life. Additionally, buying a home is typically the largest transaction an individual will be involved in throughout their life, making them less willing to go down an unconventional route.Looking back in history, an interesting example of an industry undergoing digitization is the securities industry itself. Previously, investors would have to call up their broker to place a trade. Today, investors are largely reliant on digital solutions, which has made the exchange of securities much more efficient and affordable.From around 1980 to 2003, trading costs in the U.S. declined by over 80% - throughout this same period, trading volume on the NYSE skyrocketed. Today, investors can place trades in select stocks at no cost through platforms like Robinhood.As a result, many people have been questioning whether real estate could follow suit. Typically, when buying or selling a home, transactions costs are ~6% - a 3% commission goes to the buyer’s representative, and a 3% commission goes to the seller’s representative. (There are other costs, but we’ll focus on the brokerage fees for now.) This has been the case for quite some time, and as home values fluctuate, so do transaction costs (on a dollar basis).Source: Gainsboro CapitalShould digitization take over, the transaction fees previously charged by brokers could end up disappearing. If Zillow is doing most of the buying and selling in the home market, they would benefit from higher margins. Again, this would eliminate the need for a REP, and thus pulling the rug out from underneath their advertising business. Yet if Zillow doesn't do this, it's likely someone else will.Through Zillow, there is some added value, as opposed to using a traditional broker. The company's purchase offers are in cash, adding a level of stability to the transaction. This seems to be a big determining factor for the homeowner selling their home.As the business gains traction, friction stands to be reduced. A low-friction process would make the prospect of buying and selling a home with Zillow much more appealing. If an individual can buy or sell a home with fewer headaches, why not go with that option? If Zillow is the big player in the market, then they can command a larger spread. With reduced transaction costs, their margins would again benefit.With this in mind, let’s look back at the securities industry, where trading costs have declined immensely. As it became cheaper for investors to trade through digitized platforms, they adopted online trading. This then resulted in a flock of competitors, which further pushed down trading costs. Competitors were willing to take on a smaller spread. Today, Fidelity and Charles Schwab are leaders in the space, alongside other large firms like TD Ameritrade.If lower transaction costs in real estate play out, there would very likely be increased competition. Many players would be okay taking a smaller spread. Yet we believe the capital-intensive nature of this business would be an offsetting factor; in our eyes, a smaller player wouldn’t be able to command a significant portion of the market. So long as Zillow stays on top of the ball, we believe they’ll have enough time to react before competitors get close.At the same time, these lower transaction costs may or may not lead to an increase in transaction volume, as was the case with stocks. Looking down the road, we would not be surprised to see an increase in home transaction volume sparked by reduced friction, and new, innovative business models built on these low transaction costs. This could increase the total addressable market.Yet today, sellers have a big issue to deal with - an issue which is hindering the adoption of an internet-based transaction method. Zillow’s purchase offers – in an effort to obtain higher margins, which is understandable – are typically low. Their spreads are currently quite high (6-9%) as a result. If you’ve ever tried to take your car to a dealer and get it appraised, you’ll know what this is like. Sellers who have utilized Zillow Offers often criticize the laundry list of necessary fix-ups provided by Zillow representatives, which knocks off a chunk of the home’s sale price. On top of this, the initial home offers are typically quite low.For customers, this is not enticing, as they can squeeze out a higher value for their home through the traditional transaction process today. This is an obstacle Zillow will have to overcome, which could result in tighter spreads. Yet from the numbers Zillow pushes out, it seems like sellers are okay with the trade-off, and are open to the concept despite the higher costs.Source: ZillowIn their investor update presentation, they note brokerage commissions as a line item on both sides of the transaction process (purchase & sale). Optimization of the transaction process could eliminate these costs, as mentioned. Even hiring in-house personnel could help (think of Intuit and in-house CPAs). With these commissions equating to ~6% of the home’s sale price, this would be an ideal line item to reduce.In their 1Q19 shareholder letter, management broke down the unit economics of a Zillow Homes transaction. What’s impressive is the sizable spread Zillow is taking per unit acquired. That is, there’s a spread of ~9% between the sale price and purchase price. It’s unclear whether the home acquisition cost includes commissions on the buyers' side, which would shave off 3% and reflect a ~6% spread. Regardless, a spread of 6-9% is still impressive in our eyes.Source: ZillowThe second largest expenditure is selling costs, which we believe also includes agent commissions (seller’s side) of ~3%. Total selling costs per unit are ~4.3% of sales. This is followed by renovation costs, which come in at 3.6%, and holding costs (HOA fees, insurance, taxes, etc.) which total ~1% of sales. At the moment, margins may appear low, but the top-line opportunity is quite massive.Zillow is undoubtedly a key figure in the space, with a considerable advantage given its vast network of housing data. That’s not to say that there isn’t competition. Just this past March, OpenDoor – a company in the same business as Zillow Offers – raised $300 million in a fundraising round, valuing the company at $3.8 billion. Other players in the space include Compass and Knock.Should homeowners adopt an internet-based method of home buying and selling, Zillow holds a good chance of absorbing a sizable share of these transaction costs. Today, transaction costs through Zillow Offers is higher than the industry standard 6% commission. There are benefits, although these are weighed by users on a case by case basis.Investors could also see the space split among various online brokerages, similar to the way Fidelity and Schwab make up a significant share of stock transactions today.In any event, we think the capital-intensive nature of the business is likely to keep small players small. In some ways, this could be Zillow’s moat going forward – i.e., there aren’t a lot of companies with enough cash on hand to facilitate $200 million in home transaction value per day. Unless competitors have a differentiated offering, it could be hard for them to obtain funding to go head-to-head with an incumbent like Zillow.In the letter, they break out their 3 to 5-year goals, which includes purchasing 5,000 homes per month (60,000 annualized). This is well within the demand they’ve already been seeing.Source: ZillowAt their projected EBITDA margin (2-3% at scale), $20 billion in revenue would turn up $400 to $600 million in EBITDA before adjacent opportunities. We are confident Zillow will be able to capitalize on these adjacent opportunities (escrow, etc.), which would only boost margins higher.The strongest gains would come in the later stages of the business's development, as the process is refined, costs are whittled down, and revenue grows stronger.The faster Zillow is able to eat up home transactions value in the U.S., the higher the potential returns. Way down the road, we would not be surprised to see Zillow commanding a sizable percent of home transactions in the U.S., which would provide investors with attractive returns.Investors in it for the short term should look elsewhere, whereas investors in it for the long haul stand to be well-rewarded. That said, it's important for investors to weigh the risks with the potential reward, and come to a sound conclusion in-line with their investment philosophy."
4328284,24281,2020-02-28T13:41:44-05:00,"Zillow Group recently reported that its home-flipping business is growing.The company lost an average of $6,400 per house.Guidance of future profitability is not reasonable.The market rewards growth today, but at some point the music will stop and shareholders will pay attention to losses.","Zillow Group, Inc. (Z) and (ZG) were initially trading higher earlier this week after releasing full-year and fourth-quarter results. The company's net loss of $305 million was due entirely to the home-flipping business, which accounted for $312 million of losses while other segments were significantly profitable. The company is touting the massive growth in this money-losing segment and traders seem happy with the results.For the reasons discussed below, it seems that home-flipping will only continue to lose money and eat up profits from otherwise profitable, capital-light businesses. I intend to short this stock as soon as it looks like the initial excitement over growth has faded.Zillow reports results in three business segments: Home, IMT (""internet, Media & Technology) and Mortgage. As you can see from the segment information in Zillow's earnings release:- IMT is very profitable- Mortgage is not profitable, and- Home is very much not profitable.The form 10K on page 48 reports interest expense of $70 million and $38 million in other income from the company's short-term assets generating interest. That explains the approximately $30 million additional loss not attributable to any segment.All that is to say that off the back of the envelope, if Zillow only owned its profitable IMT segment and its unprofitable (but potentially profitable) mortgage segment, net income would have been close to $35 million. To be precise, it might be a little lower because some SG&A has been attributed to the Home segment. If you thought this was an amazing stock that could make mortgages profitable and earn $100 million in net income, I would understand valuing it at $2.5 billion market cap. You could likewise say that the platform value and name brand were worth a large amount even though they haven't monetized them yet. If you thought it was 1/10th as valuable as Twitter, you could add another $3 billion to get a valuation of $5.5 billion.As reported in the table above, the P&L for the home segment includes lots of expenses for buying and renovating houses they haven't sold yet. So of course it looks really unprofitable when viewed in that way. Fortunately, the company's investor letter provides an apples-to-apples comparison of how they did on home sales:(Annotations in yellow are the author's.)In my opinion, these results are awful. Before I go on, I want to take particular exception to the idea of presenting a ""return on homes sold before interest expense"" metric. If they borrow money to flip houses, interest is a necessary expense just like taxes or insurance or paint and carpeting.As you can see from the chart above, they bought and 1900 houses for average of $286,000, did $15,000 of renovations, paid holding costs (which I infer means taxes, insurance and homeowners association dues, etc.) of $3,900, incurred almost $14,000 in selling costs and then paid $4,900 in interest. All in, these houses cost over $323,000 to buy, renovate, hold and re-sell. Then they sold the houses for $317,000.00 for a loss of $6,407 per house.It makes a certain amount of intuitive sense that Zillow would lose money like this because the biggest source of gains from housing are appreciation in land values and inflation - and Zillow's plan to flip houses in less than a year means they are foregoing both of those drivers of returns.Management claims once they achieve scale, they ""expect to deliver an average return on homes sold before interest expense of 400 to 500 basis points per home."" This not only doesn't seem plausible, even if they achieved the goal it wouldn't be very profitable.As the company showed above, it has a net loss of $1,500 per home right now. To think about what it would look like to earn 400 basis points before interest on a $286,000 house with $32,499 in expenses (representing the total of the renovation, holding, reselling and interest costs from the company's chart), the company only has a few choices to earn that 400 basis points:1. They can use the same process to sell the houses for $331,238, an increase of almost $13,000 [1.04 x ($286,000 + $32,499) = $331,238]2. They can cut expenses significantly (from $32,000 down to $20,000) and sell for an increase of $12,000.3. Sell a different kind of house.So let me point out first of all that if it were easy to sell for $12-13,000 more, you would think the company with the best data analytics would just go ahead and do that, right? Second, as we can see from choice 2 above, bringing down the expenses of holding and renovating the house by even 40% just don't move the needle very much. I'm not even sure that's possible because most of the costs are paid to third parties for things Zillow doesn't have control over. The third option of selling either more expensive or less expensive houses with a bigger ""delta"" from renovations seems most plausible to me, but if that's the case, why aren't they even talking about it?Clearly reducing renovation costs should be key to any plan to improve margins, and based on management's answer in the most recent conference call, I don't believe they have an adequate plan. In response to a question about renovation costs, management replied:Earnings transcript This is simply not the kind of answer that displays a concrete plan to improve renovation costs. Even if they could produce 400 basis points of pre-interest gain from flipping these houses, the average interest expense they incurred per house was almost $5,000. So unless they have a plan to not pay interest, the pre-tax profit on buying a house for almost $286,000 and spending $32,000 in renovations, holding costs, re-selling expenses and interest is only about $7,000-$8,000 (ie, $12,000 in profit minus interest cost of $5000). That's less than a two percent pre-tax margin. And that's only if everything goes right.But what happens if housing prices don't rise for a given area, or houses take longer to sell, or expenses increase? There are a huge number of variables here so investors need to consider this a very uncertain may to spend $320,000 to earn $7,000.For the reasons stated above, it seems clear to me that Zillow's home segment will either lose money or only make a very small amount of it while incurring significant risk. Growth in that kind of a business is a curse, not a blessing. At some point in the future the market will recognize this was a terrible idea and start to send the stock price down in recognition of the losses from this segment.The cost to borrow Zillow shares is under 1% at the time of this writing. Subject to considerations for each individual investor, it could be productive to take a 2.5% short position and wait a year for the poor economics in this segment to become apparent.I am not short shares now, but I plan to short them when I find what feels like a good entry point."
4259178,101969,2019-05-02T14:27:16-04:00,"Zillow Offers is a massive swing into the iBuying business, and the company could potentially be buying several thousand homes per month in the future.But Zillow Offers is not about making a spread on the transaction. It's about the ancillary revenue streams that being close to the transaction may provide.The key to long-term adoption is the extent to which Zillow can leverage its scale to lower its unit costs, so it can pass along those savings to homeowners.","Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) (NASDAQ:ZG) has entered the business of buying and selling homes. They started experimenting in this business in 2017 when they called it Zillow Instant Offers. Under that model, homeowners could request an offer on their home, a Premier Agent would offer a comparable market analysis (""CMA"") showing what they think it would sell for, and institutional home buyers participating in the marketplace would make an offer for their home.Eventually, Zillow started participating in the bidding for the home. That created a lot of attention in the investment community because Zillow would soon be entering into a low margin, capital-intensive business with loads of execution risk. It is certainly a huge divergence from its traditional asset-lite, advertising-driven business model.Later, Zillow kicked out the institutional bidders, leaving itself as the only bidder. Why? Because the opportunity they see is so vast that it wanted it all for themselves. This is now called Zillow Offers.Zillow Offers is now in 9 markets, including Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Raleigh, and Riverside, CA. It expects to be in 14 markets by the end of this year.The process works as follows:A homeowner contacts Zillow through the website, telling Zillow they are interested in getting an offer on their house. That includes submitting some brief information online. Shortly after, a Zillow employee calls the homeowner and discusses their situation. The homeowner submits photos of their house. Then Zillow begins to work on valuing their home to determine the appropriate bid amount and considers input from a local Premier Agent to help inform their bid. Simultaneously, an agent affiliated with Zillow puts together a comparative market analysis (""CMA"") for their home. Then Zillow presents Zillow's bid to the homeowner along with the CMA. That whole process takes just a few days.If the homeowner accepts the offer, an inspector visits the house. If that goes well enough, Zillow is then ready to close in as soon as a week or as long as two months later, which gives the homeowner flexibility to find somewhere else to live. Sometimes, Zillow reduces its bid to reflect the renovation costs it says are required.Zillow claims to bid a fair market price for the home but charges a service fee that it says might range from 6%-9% of the home value. In the fourth-quarter of 2018, the last quarter reported, the average fee was 7%.If the homeowner declines Zillow's offer, then Zillow asks if they want to be put in touch with a Premier Agent. Interestingly, management says 20% of the homeowners who decline Zillow's offer end up listing their home within 2 months and another 25% end up listing a couple months later. So together, of those who decline Zillow's offer, 45% of them end up listing their home with an agent within 4 months. Seller leads are much more valuable to agents than buyer leads, and Zillow hopes to monetize them by getting a referral fee upon closings.Management thinks 2.75 million home transactions per year would be in its current ""buy box"" if it were operating in the top 200 markets today. That's roughly half of the annual number of existing home sales (5.4 million). A house in the buy box simply means a house that Zillow would make an offer on. Interestingly, they hope to expand their buy box criteria over time.The big question is how many homes will eventually sell to iBuyers like Zillow, OpenDoor, Offerpad, or others. Exhibit 1 shows three scenarios. The two variables are 1) the percent of homes that are sold to iBuyers, and 2) the market share of Zillow Offers. It is also assuming Zillow's current buy box criteria, which this exercise assumes doesn't change.As you can see, it's possible that one day Zillow could be buying many multiples of the 5,000 homes per month that it expects to be buying in 3-5 years. The two variables are anyone's guess, but one data point is that 10% of all home sales in Phoenix, ground zero for iBuying, are to iBuyers. Maybe that suggests 10% is achievable in the top 200 markets, or it could be that it goes higher over time. Or maybe that is unique to Phoenix and the rest of the country won't reach that level. Or perhaps Zillow or others will be able to reduce their fees, which would drive up adoption over the long term. The bottom line is Zillow Offers could be a massive business over the next several years.The reason I'm using 30%, 40%, and 50% market share figures for Zillow here is that I think it is clear that they have a meaningful competitive advantage in this space. They have loads of traffic coming directly to their site, most of which they don't have to pay for. That's a fundamentally lower cost structure than their competitors, who have to spend much more to acquire site traffic. That advantage should allow Zillow to offer homeowners a better value proposition in the form of higher bids and/or lower fees. This is the Costco model, sometimes called ""scale economies shared,"" where companies pass on their cost savings to customers through lower prices, which drives volume and widens the moat.Zillow reports results for Zillow Offers in the new Homes segment. Exhibit 2 shows the Homes segment P&L for 2018.As you can see, the Homes segment started selling homes in the third quarter last year. Management expects the pace to ramp quickly, including $100 - $115 million in revenue in 1Q 2019, which will be reported in early May. That is roughly 10x the sales pace of 3Q 2018.Exhibit 3 shows the underlying data on the houses Zillow has sold before Homes segment operating costs, like sales and marketing, technology, and other overhead.As a former Zillow executive pointed out to me, this data doesn't include customer acquisition costs. I understand his point; however, Zillow does not appear to be spending any money advertising Zillow Offers. In fact, in January, management said, ""We haven't spent a dime on advertising."" Certainly, the overall company has customer acquisition costs, so Zillow should technically allocate some of that to Zillow Offers. But thus far it has not, probably because it reasons that it's not spending anything it wasn't already spending anyway. I see both sides. What's important is to understand the point and keep it in mind.Exhibit 4 shows the same data as Exhibit 3 but on a per-home basis.As you can see the average selling price per home has been about $296,000 so far. Home Acquisition Costs is the amount Zillow has been paying the average homeowner, which has been $266,000 last year and 90% of their eventual sale price. However, the headline offer homeowners get from Zillow is much higher than this. Management disclosed it charged a 7% service fee in 4Q, which suggests the average headline offer that was accepted was about $294,000 in 4Q. Exhibit 5 shows how I calculate the average headline offer to the homeowner.I start at the bottom with the Net to Homeowner line, which is equal to the Home Acquisition Costs line. I assume Zillow charges the homeowner the same amount it spends on renovations (I'm still not sure about this, and will ask management), so I'm using the renovation figures from Exhibit 4. Then, applying the same 7% service fee Zillow charged in 4Q to both quarters, suggests about $21,000 in fees, making the headline offer price about $296,000.What's really interesting is the headline offer price is virtually identical to the price Zillow went on to sell these homes for. Exhibit 6 compares Zillow's headline offer price to its eventual sale price.It appears as if management realized it was making too much of a spread right off the bat, and adjusted it closer to breakeven. That's actually what the last former Zillow executive I spoke with suggested happened early on. Interestingly, I asked him how the headline offer price compares to fair market value, and he said it's actually pretty close. This analysis supports that. I think that's important for the homeowner to believe they are getting a reasonable deal.Going back to Exhibit 4, renovation, holding, and selling costs have averaged 3.0%, 0.9%, and 4.5% of sales so far, leaving a return before financing of 1.6%. Interest has eaten up 0.8%, leaving a 0.8% margin after interest.Clearly, bottom line profit margins are thin, but that is by design. The overarching strategy is to give homeowners the best deal Zillow can afford while still breaking even on the transaction. That will maximize adoption of Zillow Offers, and will drive lots of ancillary revenue streams.Over time, I expect Zillow to gain economies of scale as they increase their market-by-market volume. That could benefit renovation costs over time. Theoretically, being able to offer contractors a larger amount of work should enable Zillow to extract concessions for labor costs. And volume discounts for materials like paint and supplies should materialize with greater scale.Holding costs are a function of Zillow's holding period for the homes. That includes property taxes, insurance, utilities, association dues, and that sort of thing. Zillow is targeting a maximum turnaround time of 90 days on each home. I think as Zillow scales in each market, Zillow Offers will become more well-known, and Zillow will get better at marketing and pre-marketing its Zillow-owned homes to all its monthly active users who it knows are searching for specific homes like theirs. Many of those get e-mail alerts for homes that match their criteria. Zillow should also be able to improve its ability to buy homes it knows it can sell quickly.Selling costs of 4.5% is a big expense bucket. Today, Zillow uses Premier Agents to sell these homes. My guess is Zillow's seller agent gets something around a 1.0% commission, and if there's a buyer's agent, they get 2.5% or 3.0%. 2.5%-3.0% is on par with the rest of the real estate market. Zillow probably can't reduce that because it would incentivize buyers agents to discourage their buyers from looking at Zillow-owned homes. I'm not banking on Zillow being able to reduce its commissions much, although it may be able to minimize other closing costs.Eventually, maybe Zillow could use its brand and website to somehow nudge home buyers into coming to Zillow without a buyer's agent. That's speculation on my part, but it would certainly help reduce selling costs.So overall, I think there is room for operating leverage on renovation, holding, and selling cost lines, to one extent or another. However, I'm completely confident that Zillow will reinvest those savings into higher home acquisition costs. In other words, Zillow would reduce its 7% fee, effectively paying more for homes. Why wouldn't management let its scale-driven cost savings drop to the bottom line? Because lowering their fee and paying more for homes could dramatically increase the homeowner adoption of Zillow Offers. Management has said the price elasticity of demand is very high with Zillow Offers; in other words, homeowners are very sensitive to price. The number of homeowners who will accept Zillow's offer appears to increase significantly when Zillow simply reduces its fee from 8% to 7%, for example. And it will increase even more so at 6%. And that has huge implications for the Homes segment, as well as Zillow's ancillary revenue streams.As I briefly discussed with a former Zillow executive, I think the holy grail for Zillow Offers will be if or when the homeowner can net more money from selling to Zillow than they net from a traditional home sale using an agent.First, I think it's established that selling to Zillow is a better experience for the seller. It is massively more convenient with fewer hassles, more certainty, and a flexible closing date. They don't have to fix anything broken or do upgrades, they don't have to clean up, they don't have to have open houses, and they can close anywhere from a week to a two months.So if homeowners can ever also come out ahead financially relative to what they would net by selling the traditional way through an agent, virtually everyone will want Zillow to buy their home. It would be a complete game-changer for both Zillow and the industry.So where do we stand now? Exhibit 7 shows my understanding of the homeowner's economics between selling to Zillow and selling the traditional way using an agent.For the traditional sale, I first assume selling through an agent would get no more for homes than Zillow does. After all, Zillow is using a seller's agent too.Second, I use a 5.5% total commission in place of Zillow's recent 7% service fee. Finally, I think it's a fair assumption that homeowners would have to spend the same amount on renovations that Zillow spends in order to get the same sale price that Zillow gets. Implicit in this is the homeowner will have to spend the same amount that Zillow would have charged him/her, which may not be exactly right but is probably close enough.By my math, the average homeowner may be about $4,400 ahead by selling the traditional way. Of course, lots of homeowners are choosing to pay that price to avoid the headaches and hassles of a traditional sale. It might be well worth the extra cost. For $4,400, they are avoiding the following:In addition, when homeowners sell to Zillow they can have a flexible closing date that should give them enough time to find a suitable place to live. That alone might be worth $4,400 for many families.Frankly, Zillow Offers seems like an attractive value proposition, assuming my assumptions are reasonable. And that explains why the number of homes Zillow buys appears to growing exponentially. Exhibit 8 shows Zillow's home buying and selling activity through the end of last year, and a rough estimate of what may have occurred in 1Q.Zillow expects to sell $100 - $115 million worth of homes in 1Q, which at $300,000 per home works out to about 358 homes. That's 10x the number of homes sold just two quarters prior.So what is likely to happen when Zillow can leverage its increasing scale in all these markets? I expect them to be able to gain leverage on renovation costs, holding costs, and selling costs, to one degree or another, and therefore pass along those cost savings to homeowners through higher offers/lower service fees. If Zillow can simply drop its average service fee from 7% to 6% or 5.5% over time, while still at least breaking even on the transaction, selling homeowners won't have good reasons to sell traditionally through an agent.You might wonder why breaking even on buying and selling homes would be a worthwhile business, let alone a good business. It's not, but it opens up two very large and potentially lucrative opportunities: mortgages and seller leads."
4265636,103480,2019-05-22T08:30:00-04:00,"Shares of Zillow have rebounded sharply this year, accelerating particularly after a strong Q1 earnings release.Revenues jumped more than 50% y/y, driven primarily by continued ramp of Zillow Offers. The company launched its tenth Offers market in Minnesota in May.Zillow has seemingly managed to control the narrative around Offers, which analysts initially thought would be a balance sheet destroyer.Also importantly in the core Premier Agent business, Zillow reported that churn rates have returned to normal levels.","Zillow (Z) is no longer looking as terrible as it once did. The leading online real estate company has just reported fantastic Q1 results that blew Wall Street's revenue expectations out of the water. And in spite of widespread fears of home price declines and a tightening of the housing market, Zillow's flagship Premier Agent business (which essentially sells ad space and collects referrals from real estate agents) has stabilized relative to earlier reports that agents were leaving Zillow in droves.Zillow's improved narrative, backed by strong financial results, have helped to buoy the stock back above $40 again. Now up 36% year-to-date, Zillow still has plenty of runway to claim in order to get back to its 52-week high of $65:Data by YChartsIn my view, investors have a well-timed opportunity to invest in Zillow while shares are - at least, from a historical perspective - at modest values. The sentiment around Zillow at the moment can best be described as ""skeptic"" - an attitude launched alongside the introduction of Zillow Offers. However, Zillow has shed more light on Offers this quarter that has made analysts and investors more comfortable around its prospects. Guggenheim's analyst recently upgraded Zillow to Buy primarily due to its progress in Zillow Offers.We've certainly seen the results on the revenue side. As predicted, once the Offers ramp was in a more mature state, it would drive tremendous revenue growth. This quarter, Zillow's revenue jumped 51% y/y to $454.1 million, absolutely crushing Wall Street's expectations of $432.1 million (+44% y/y) by a seven-point margin:Figure 1. Zillow 1Q19 resultsSource: Zillow 1Q19 earnings releaseMoreover, Zillow's other, ""original"" line of business - the business of selling ad space to real estate agents - is holding up its end and driving a 31% y/y jump in adjusted EBITDA to $61.0 million, helping to cover losses in the nascent Homes segment.In my view, Zillow is on the verge of turning its narrative around and eliminating the discount on its share price that has weighed on the stock since the introduction of Zillow Offers. Investors should stay long and buy into the strength.By far the most critical turning point for Zillow will be its ability to sell its new Homes/Zillow Offers business to investors. This quarter marked a major turning point, with 414 sold homes driving $128.5 million in revenue (28% of Zillow's total Q1 revenue base)Figure 2. Zillow Homes metricsSource: Zillow shareholder letterThis quarter, the Homes segment essentially broke even - which, given the fact that Zillow Offers has barely been running for less than a year, is an impressive feat. Zillow also outlined its path from roughly breakeven today to a ~4-5% return at scale. As the company begins to snap up homes in larger quantities, it will capitalize on economies of scale on buying and holding homes, as well as reducing holding periods:Figure 3. Zillow Homes long-term modelSource: Zillow shareholder letterIn addition to streamlining the Offers process, Zillow can also drive additional revenue opportunities (not included in the 4-5% returns above) by marketing tertiary services to its instant sellers, such as title & escrow services (long a fee-rich area of the real estate industry).Currently operating in ten markets including the recently-launched Minnesota, Zillow has near-term expansion plans to ten other markets in the U.S., including the dense metro areas of Los Angeles, San Diego and Miami.Figure 4. Zillow Offers coverage territoriesSource: Zillow shareholder letterWith this quarter, Zillow has managed to turn around the general consensus that Zillow Offers is a drag on what used to be a pure Internet advertising business. As Zillow's flagship agent offerings hit a saturation point, it's critical for the company to leverage its massive data assets into generating other sources of revenue and EBITDA growth. While it was slow in getting off the ground, Zillow Offers has the potential to become a multibillion-dollar annual revenue stream generating a positive 2-3% EBITDA margin, alongside the ability to generate higher-margin revenue streams from currently untested services like title and insurance offerings.While much of investors' focus this quarter was devoted to Homes, it's also encouraging to see the recovery on the Premier Agent side of the business. Zillow's newly-named IMT (Internet, Media, and Technology) segment generated sluggish 6% y/y revenue growth to $298.3 million, driven by a 2% y/y increase in Premier Agent revenues to $217.7 million.In the backdrop of seemingly dour results, recall that Zillow's Premier Agent business has been under fire all year. The trouble began in 3Q18, when Zillow surprisingly reported higher-than-expected advertiser churn, driven both by a change in Zillow's pricing model as well as a cooling housing market.The headwinds facing this business, however, have seemingly moderated. Zillow reported in its shareholder letter that ""advertiser cancellations, or churn, is returning to normal levels"" - stabilizing two quarters after dipping first in 3Q18. Zillow also reported that its Flex pricing model - which only charges agents when they close a transaction with a Zillow lead, and nothing upfront - has seen positive responses in its test markets.Rich Barton, Zillow's CEO, noted as follows on the Q1 earnings call:Premier Agent has long been Zillow's bread and butter, so the fact that it's on the path to ""improving as planned"" is a critical sentiment driver for Zillow's stock. The IMT segment drove $61.0 million of EBITDA this quarter, up 31% y/y and representing ~3x of the company's total. As Zillow continues to ramp its Homes segment to reach an eventual state of profitability, the company needs to lean in on its margin-rich Premier Agent business to drive profits.Investors are becoming increasingly comfortable with the enlarged contribution from Offers in Zillow's business. For the first time this quarter, the company has highlighted that Zillow Offers is capable of generating positive unit economics, and the current state of the business - which, on average, lost only about $3,000 per home sold this quarter - isn't too far from the eventual target-state model. Tertiary revenue opportunities like title insurance, moving services and mortgage brokering add incremental justification for growing the Homes business.At the same time, Zillow's flagship Premier Agent business is showing signs of recovery, as evidenced by positive y/y revenue growth and reports of stabilized churn. For most of the past year, Zillow's stock has been placed in the penalty box for these two reasons - fears of large losses in Homes, as well as higher churn on the Premier Agent side - and this quarter, Zillow moderated concerns for both. Stay long on this name."
4232801,103480,2019-01-11T08:50:32-05:00,"Shares of Zillow have suffered an extended decline and look poised to rebound.Macroeconomic data for real estate is starting to look up, with mortgage conditions easing and housing inventory improving.A recovery in home sales may give real estate agents more confidence to advertise, which would fix the problems seen in the Premier Agent business last quarter.Zillow's user traffic also remains elevated, suggesting that the platform hasn't lost its importance despite a slower market.","Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), the real estate marketplace and data giant, has undisputedly been one of the hardest-hit stocks in 2018. After hitting highs above $65 in the summer, shares of Zillow promptly crashed below $30 and still remains well under 50% of their prior peak value.Z data by YChartsTo be fair, many fundamental factors worked against Zillow in 2018. Perhaps the biggest faux pas on the company's part was its decision to double-down on Zillow Instant Offers, which essentially is a home-flipping service that would put real estate on Zillow's balance sheet. Investors and Wall Street decried the move, considering it foolish to initiate real estate investments and incur balance sheet risk at the zenith of a possible bubble in the market. However, as I noted in a prior article, Zillow's planned scale for Instant Offers is actually a lot smaller than the impact it's had on Zillow's market value, and so it shouldn't be too great a concern.Then the next biggest worry was the possibility of a sharp slowdown in Premier Agent revenues. As most investors know, Zillow nabs the lion's share of its revenues from real estate agents who advertise on its platform. With the housing market threatening to cool off sharply, many feared that agents would cut back on ad spending. Indeed, in Zillow's previous quarter, the company reported a sharp uptick in advertiser churn.When bearish narratives begin to dominate a single stock, they tend to pile on and leave no room for positivity. In my view, however, the worst is over for Zillow, and the stock is poised for a long-overdue rebound. Let's review why the reality is much better than feared for Zillow - and the catalysts that could drive the stock higher in 2019.It's true that the effects of housing market slowdown have been felt across the board. Existing home-sales data has considerably weakened in the back half of 2018, though the latest data for November 2018 (released in December) suggests a slight rebound (or dead cat bounce). The sharpest slowdowns, however, have been felt in the upper end of the market. We've heard stories all year about New York's luxury real estate market is incredibly slack. Residential brokerage Stribling & Associates reported that luxury Manhattan sales saw a 25% y/y decline in 4Q18.In my view, Zillow is much less impacted by this segment of the market. Zillow's primary users are younger, middle or upper-middle class renters and homebuyers. Prospective buyers in the >$5 million range are likely to have other sources for real estate research, and the high-end agents that cater to these buyers likely have other advertising channels than Zillow. Despite the plunge in luxury sales, I'd expect Zillow to hold up much stronger.Continuing on the macro theme, we've seen some of the key indicators begin to turn positive. Let's start with the first and most obvious: interest rates. Ever since Fed Chairman Powell's statements that the Fed would be ""flexible"" on rates amid a possible global slowdown, stocks have soared and rates have pulled back.CNBC recently reported that mortgage applications rose 23.5% week-over-week this week in response to lower mortgage rates. The average 30-year fixed rate has fallen to 4.74%, 22bps lower than a month ago. Higher mortgage rates were one of the primary drivers behind analysts' predictions that real estate sales (and indirectly, Zillow's advertising revenues) would see a downturn in 2019. Though rates are still expected to rise this year, the pace of growth seems to be much more benign, which would lead us to think that the impact on real estate sales volumes will also be more muted.The other important macro driver is housing inventory. Recently, Redfin's Chief Economist reported that housing inventory saw 5% y/y growth in November - the fastest growth rate in three years. In particular, some of the country's hottest markets, like San Jose and Seattle, saw significant boosts in inventory.Most agree that lack of housing inventory was one of the biggest drivers to slow existing-home sales in 2018. If we follow this logic further, slow existing-home sales and fewer transaction commissions for agents may have caused them to rein in their advertising budgets, directly impacting Zillow. Now, however, it seems that the real estate market is achieving a better supply-demand balance that may provoke a jump in home sales in 2019. If this is the case, the problems that Zillow experienced in its Premier Agent business last quarter could be rectified.Amid the possibility of a macro-driven recovery in real estate, it's also important to recognize that Zillow's standing in the industry remains on firm footing. In the company's most recent quarter, it reported a 7% y/y rise in average MAUs across its brands. Earlier, in June 2018, the company reached an all-time traffic high of 195 million MAUs.Figure 1. Zillow Q3 traffic dataSource: Zillow Q3 earnings releaseZillow has ownership over all of the key brands in real estate, including Trulia and StreetEasy (which those who've lived in New York would know is the dominant housing platform in Manhattan). Its access to data is immense, and Zillow searches have become a vital part of the research process for prospective home buyers. The home I recently purchased, for example, first came to my attention through a Zillow notification on a saved search in my area.For a real estate agent, advertising on Zillow is akin to advertising on primetime TV. Zillow's users already have high intent of executing a real estate transaction - which makes a Zillow ad much more effective than a static newspaper or billboard ad. Though Premier Agent revenues may see fluctuations from time to time, Zillow's access to a captive audience gives it a tremendous moat.Zillow's slide in share price - and lack of a meaningful recovery - have left its valuation incredibly cheap in the wake of a brightening macro outlook for 2019. At present, the company trades at a market cap of $6.40 billion.Its balance sheet, however, is loaded with cash. As of the end of Q3, the company has $643.8 million of cash and $999.2 million of short-term investments on its balance sheet. After netting out $715.0 million of revolving and long-term debt, the company's net cash position is $928.0 million, indicating an enterprise value of $5.47 billion.Figure 2. Zillow Q3 balance sheetSource: Zillow 10-QIt's important to note that not even Instant Offers could deplete Zillow's cash balance. In Q3, Zillow purchased 168 homes and sold 36 through Zillow Instant Offers. Even if Zillow purchased 1,000 homes at an average price of $223,000 (the median home price in the U.S., per Zillow data), the company wouldn't even consume one-quarter of its net cash.And, against Zillow's estimated FY19 revenues of $1.75 billion (per Yahoo Finance), Zillow trades at an incredibly cheap ~3x forward revenues. As seen in the chart below, Zillow's current valuation multiple is well below historical averages:Z EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsZillow's 2018 selloff seems far overdone, and the stock is now trading at an incredibly attractive price that sits far below historical trading multiples. Though many of the risks Zillow faced in 2018 (and still faces in 2019) are genuine, early macroeconomic indicators point to the fact that 2019 may be much more benign than expected. Zillow possesses a unique, data-rich asset that has become a mainstay of real estate advertising, and the company has the scale and resources to navigate through a down cycle. At current prices, Zillow is a strong buy."
4241373,104659,2019-02-15T04:56:46-05:00,"While upheaval in Zillow's advertising business has hurt results recently, management is transitioning to a more scalable referral-based model.Its share price will likely be under continued pressure as its new business of flipping homes is low margin, capital intensive, and risky.However, long-term, Zillow is well-positioned to develop a more integrated service in real estate than any of the established companies can offer.","Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) (NASDAQ:ZG) recently decided to do something companies rarely do; it's a mature company radically altering its business model. Zillow has been around since 2004 and remarkably has never been profitable aside from a few quarters.While allowing listings to be viewed online was revolutionary, Zillow has mostly leveraged its go-to status for real estate browsing to serve as a lead generation service for traditional real estate agents.Its advertising model requires massive sales and marketing spending. Consequently, Zillow's model doesn't scale profitably, as its sales staff has to aggressively market the service to the two million plus agents in America.Management has finally grasped the need for change and is moving towards a referral model. Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN) already successfully refers users to third-party agents in markets where its own agents don't operate in, and as Zillow dominates online traffic for real estate, it should be able to do this on a much larger scale.Its long-term opportunity rests on further marginalizing the role of an agent in a transaction. Zillow's recent move into flipping homes is risky, and it's unclear how profitable the business can become, but it opens up opportunities to further expand into adjacent services, like mortgages, title services, etc., and grow its relationship with buyers and sellers.The transition will be difficult; agents have already reacted poorly to recent changes. The change to referrals can happen in the next year or two, but it will be years before we know if the flipping business can be a sustainable corporate model. With the selloff in the stock, I've purchased a small position in the company but will wait for the stock price to fall another 30% to 40% before considering making Zillow a large position in my portfolio.Disillusionment with Zillow's lack of profitability, slowing growth and recent entry into a low-margin and capital intensive business has created pessimism among investors. Zillow's high gross margins, now over 90%, caused investors to wrongly assume it would generate high profit margins in the future.To regain investors' trust, it has to cut down on sales and marketing spending and reduce churn in its Premier Agent advertising business.Zillow needs to leverage its popular brand to deepen its relationship with its users. Unlike Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), Zillow's traffic is not dependent on paid search. User growth was strong in 2018 and looks set to continue to grow.S&M spending hasn't led to profitability though, and a new approach, which doesn't ask agents to pay upfront for advertising without assurances of a commission, is needed. The new flex pricing model it is testing could be the answer.It's easy to see why Zillow has to work hard to convince individual agents throughout the country of the effectiveness of the program. A salesperson usually needs to be involved, and agents have to invest a significant amount per month for leads with no guarantee the leads will ever buy or sell a home.To improve the customer experience, Zillow is now handling the initial contact with prospective buyers/sellers first and then passing the person on to a Premier Agent. Agents before were given mostly unvetted leads, and some users weren't getting contacted by the agents.It's unclear how committed Zillow is to this, as it's reportedly walking back some of the changes already. However, I've only been able to find Inman articles about this and nothing on Zillow's investor relations page or Twitter page.Zillow is getting into the house flipping business in a big way, and, if successful, it could mean traditional agents will be entirely cut out of the process in the future.Instant offers is an option for sellers where Zillow acts as an intermediary between the buyer and seller eliminating the need for an agent to manage the process of negotiating price, repairs, terms, etc. leading to a more seamless transaction. It's a low-margin business which will have to be significantly streamlined to ever become a viable model.Investors have been skeptical as Zillow is going from plus 90% gross margins in its advertising business to a risky and capital-intensive model. Its CEO has tried to compare its pivot to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) moving into originals, but the viability of this model is still unclear.Opendoor, the largest home flipping startup currently, has raised a significant amount of debt, highly unusual for a startup, and Zillow will use non-recourse debt to finance purchases despite having over a billion dollars in cash on its balance sheet.Reviews on Yelp for Opendoor, to put it kindly, have been mixed. A recent article in Inman even reported that Yelp was hiding Opendoor's review page and that the CEO of Yelp was an early investor in Opendoor.The potential convenience of this model is enticing though. Sellers get the certainty of knowing their home will sell without having to go through the frustrating real estate process. No more having to worry about a buyer getting cold feet or not getting approved for a loan.Homeowners don't have to bend over backwards to accommodate all the showings and open houses. Sellers also don't have to make an offer on a new home contingent on their old home selling first and risk potentially losing out on a home they want to buy.While I'm still skeptical, it makes some sense for Zillow. It already has a massive user base it can leverage to keep acquisition costs low. Its approach is less costly than Opendoor or Redfin, as it uses independent agents to handle the sale.The exciting part of Zillow getting into the direct-home buying business is it can leverage this new exposure to sellers to drive more growth in its lead generation service.Zillow also acquired a mortgage business recently as it tries to offer users a more seamless service. For the business model to work, independent agents will have to be cut out of the process eventually. It'll need to have massive scale to do this, and net profits will have to be higher than Zillow's current target.Zillow and Redfin have the advantage of having other sources of revenue that can be relied on. That's why I believe they and Opendoor, with its sizable lead already, are best positioned to succeed. Customer interest seems to be strong for this new way of selling a home.Ownership of the customer relationship will allow Zillow to grow in a way a traditional brokerage cannot. If customers are satisfied with Zillow's offers, then it's not a big leap for them to go with Zillow for their mortgage and other services down the road.The real estate industry is already skeptical of Zillow, and with increasing consolidation happening among brokerages, the industry eventually may try to regain control of the marketing of their listings in an attempt to drive traffic away from Zillow's website/app.However, given how fractured the industry is, brokerages and the National Association of Realtors haven't able to hinder Zillow much at all. The NAR made an enormous strategic blunder a long time ago by selling its interest in Realtor.com. This allowed Zillow to build up its two-sided network of an enormous base of users and a comprehensive amount of listings.Buyers are increasingly starting their search for a home online, and services like Zillow provide public exposure for sellers' properties in a way that real estate brokerages' own websites/apps cannot. Ultimately, it's up to sellers if they want their home marketed on Zillow or not, giving agents and brokerages little leverage over Zillow.Zillow's brand is synonymous with real estate. Remarkably, unlike review sites like TripAdvisor and Yelp, Zillow is not dependent on paid google searches to drive traffic. This shows just how important Zillow is for its users.I've come to believe direct home-buying can be complementary to its Premier Agent service, and it seems clear there is significant demand from sellers. But with growth slowing and continued disruptions as Zillow makes changes, I believe the best strategy is to wait for a large drop in the stock price.The EV to Revenue ratio is low historically for Zillow, but its lack of profitability and diminished margin outlook from the flipping business means a high revenue multiple isn't warranted.Data by YChartsThat said if Zillow continues its transition to a referral model, I'll be a buyer on any large selloff in the stock. I'd prefer to buy around a 3 to 3.5 EV to Revenue ratio given the current uncertainty surrounding the company."
4253722,101850,2019-04-10T07:54:33-04:00,"We see the multi-billion dollar iBuying opportunity, but expect near-term losses to be large and execution to be difficult.Opcity expansion favors Zillow’s business.Challenges and high valuation justify our neutral position on the stock.","Zillow's (Z) 4Q results and guidance reflect how the company is transitioning to grow the Homes business and is now essentially a call option on iBuying. There could also be potentially significant changes in the competitive landscape following Realtor.com decision to expand OpCity lead routing.Following a disappointing 2018, Zillow is set to invest heavily in its Homes segment, expanding the company's total addressable market, while guiding toward $115M in revenue and -$33M of EBITDA in 1Q19. It also expects to purchase 5k homes per month in the next 3-5 years, with annualized Homes revenue reaching $20B.We are optimistic about the opportunity, but we don't want investors to underestimate the execution risks including asset intensity, logistical challenges, tight margins, and higher investment. Additionally, we believe this business won't be EBITDA positive before 2023. Given Zillow's venture-like structure, especially with the return of Rich Barton, we expect the durability of the core business and Homes' traction to drive earnings power and the multiple investors are willing to pay.Regarding Realtor.com's expansion of OpCity lead routing, we're expecting the move to drive more spend to Zillow, softening the blow of its own model changes in the Premier Agent transition. Although this doesn't change the poor medium-term outlook for the Premier Agent business, it suggests that Zillow's guidance for the business might be conservative.For every 10% of Realtor.com lead generation budget shifting to Zillow, it could add ~4 ppts to PA revenue growth by our estimates. We see the disruptive headlines and concern among agents as a positive for Zillow near term, and longer term, as this should help its own shift to Flex Pricing commission-based lead sales.Despite the overall positive outlook in the long-term, near-term challenges and the fairly high current valuations at ~6x P/ Sales, drive our neutral position in the stock.Entry into this asset-heavy business introduces significant risks that are absent in the core advertising business, but Zillow is establishing some risk management measures in place. The company has been hiring a team from Colony American Homes and Starwood Capital with experience managing large real estate portfolios, providing some confidence in the know-how they'll bring to the space. The company also explained in a New York meeting that it has in place a system that limits its credit facilities and thus, its ability to buy into home cohorts that do not end up following expected behavioral patterns. For example, if the company purchased a cohort of homes that end up proving to be more difficult to sell than originally anticipated, the credit facility will not allow the company to purchase further homes that fall into this cohort.A significant driver of the Homes segment has been the ability to monetize seller inquiries that do not result in purchase by Zillow (iBuying) by referring these people to agents. The company, however, signaled this could be a concern. Given the scenario where Zillow declined to provide a potential seller a cash bid, but instead offered to connect the seller to an agent to sell their home, this could result in the perception of a ""bait and switch"" move by Zillow. As a result, we come away less upbeat about the seller-lead opportunity. This is particularly disappointing because while the Homes segment unit economics are likely to take years to scale, we saw seller leads as something that Zillow could more quickly monetize.OpCity is a lead validation platform that generates millions of real estate leads around the web, filters them, then transfers the lead to the first agent that responds to a mobile alert. It's similar to Zillow's PA transition, but the problem about OpCity is that it does the lead filtering and sells leads on a 30-35% commission basis when a transaction is closed. In addition, unlike the Zillow PA model, OpCity only offers live phone call leads instead of Zillow's mix of phone and e-mail leads. When Realtor acquired OpCity, it stated it would offer OpCity as an additional opportunity, but in some markets, it is now the only offer for lead generation. The feedback from the agent community has been quite negative, which could help shift budget back to Zillow, and this could also facilitate Zillow's own ramping of its commission-based model, Flex Pricing.With that in mind, the full-year 4% YoY growth from the company's PA guidance seems a bit conservative. Additionally, the company mentioned PA transition costs are stabilizing and that Agents realized that other alternatives are not working as well as Zillow. Since ~60% of home transactions usually happen in 2Q and 3Q, we think the company could benefit from stabilization in churned agent dollars ahead of the home selling seasons. From a comps perspective, 2H19 has easier comps so we think there is a basis for the PA revenue acceleration.Competitive advantages in the short-term from the expansion of OpCity, and PA costs stabilization partially offset challenges in the execution of the Homes business and the iBuying opportunity.The core Internet Media & Technology (IMT) business won't require as much investment as expected, Zillow assured, as most of the employees' backfill is already done. The only notable investment pointed out is in its rental business where it hopes to expand ancillary services for property managers.Though we're upbeat on the company's long-term prospects, we still think the stock is pricey at ~6x sales - even following the recent drawdown. Hence, we're remaining on the sidelines on Zillow for now, but further de-rating in valuations may just get us interested."
4290284,105372,2019-09-06T19:12:36-04:00,"Zillow’s move into iBuying is a high risk, high reward strategy, which greatly increases their total addressable market.The only genuine competitor in the market at this stage is Opendoor, but strong competition will make profitability difficult.Zillow’s success in iBuying will be dependent on their ability to leverage data and manage operations efficiently.","Zillow's (Z) move into iBuying has resulted in tremendous revenue growth and, if they can become profitable, will greatly increase the value of the company. Although iBuying is likely to be a low margin and volatile business, I believe Zillow's experience estimating property prices, control over leads through their website and large financial resources give them an advantage in the market, which will allow them to be successful.Zillow was founded in 2006 as an online real estate database company that generated revenue by selling advertising on its website. Zillow has recently shifted strategy and now operates three segments:Due to the rapid growth in the Homes segment, it will soon dwarf the other segments and will make or break Zillow as a company.In a well-functioning market, buyers and sellers should be able to execute transactions quickly, at a fair price and with reasonable fees. This becomes difficult when the product is highly differentiated, has a high value, and transactions are relatively infrequent, like in real estate. As a result, home buyers and sellers are faced with an illiquid market with high transaction fees. Instant buying or iBuying is a relatively new business model which seeks to reduce friction in the real estate market and create liquidity by buying homes from sellers instantly and then selling to buyers at a later date, similar to corporate bonds where institutions such as investment banks act as intermediaries, holding their own inventory, providing liquidity for a fee. iBuyers are seeking compensation for removing friction from transactions and bearing price risk for sellers, a risk that it has a much greater understanding of through data analytics.Innovation in the real estate market has been slow, likely due to a lack of incentive for incumbents. For individual buyers and sellers, transactions are infrequent, giving little incentive to push for a simpler solution. Real estate transactions are also large, making buyers and sellers risk averse and unwilling to try new services. There is also a significant amount of regulation and paperwork associated with real estate transactions and assistance to buyers and sellers can be valuable. These factors have led to consumers accepting the status quo even if the services provided by agents are expensive.Figure 1: Residential Real Estate Commissions(Source: The Economist)Previous tech approaches to the real estate market, like Zillow and Redfin (RDFN) were unable capture a large portion of the industry's value as they worked within the confines of the existing system. iBuying is a disruptive innovation which has the potential to reshape the industry value chain and capture a huge amount of value. It is a business model which seeks to create value though, not just capture value, and its rapid rise indicates that there is latent demand for liquidity from an underserved market segment.Some of the key features of the iBuying value proposition to consumers are:The real estate market presents a large opportunity for disruptive innovation as it is large and relatively inefficient. It is estimated that the iBuying total addressable market in the U.S. is approximately 900 billion USD, but it is likely to be a competitive and low margin business. In 2018, iBuyers accounted for over 25,000 transactions nationally (approximately 0.2% market share) although iBuyers have currently only entered a handful of markets and are growing rapidly.iBuyers have entered big cities with large ""cookie-cutter"" housing stocks first which provides them with a large addressable market and housing which is relatively easy to value and sell quickly. Although most benefits of scale will accrue in individual markets (e.g. large scale in a city will allow favorable terms with contractors like security or renovators), there will also be significant benefit to scaling across regions as it will diversify risk and should allow more favorable financing terms. New markets are also likely to be less favorable and present challenges like seasonality, heterogeneous housing stock and crime.Despite its large potential, iBuying is a risky business model, and at this stage, it is not clear if it will be profitable or able to withstand a real estate market downturn. There is a large amount of concern amongst investors that, in the event of a real estate market downturn, iBuyers will be stuck with a large inventory of housing that it is unable to sell and is declining in value. iBuyers believe this risk is overstated as they can charge greater fees during periods of volatility. I believe iBuying is only likely to be viable if competition is low as competition will be based primarily on price, leading to low margins, and these margins are unlikely to be sufficient to compensate a company during a downturn.Many online businesses have achieved success by controlling the customer relationship and integrating it with however it is their industry generates revenue. For example, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) controls the customer relationship and is now integrating content creation. Zillow controls the customer relationship in the real estate industry through its dominant position in lead generation and by integrating this with the actual transaction process could potentially capture the majority of the value in the real estate industry.Zillow entered iBuying in April 2018, and although it is a relatively late entrant to the market, it is growing rapidly; aided by Zillow's brand name, financial resources and dominant position in lead generation. This is resulting in a rapid shift in the financial performance of the business as they shift from a high-margin, asset-light business to a low-margin, capital-intensive business. Revenue is expanding rapidly, and Zillow's target of $20 billion revenue annually in the next 3-5 years does not appear unrealistic.Figure 2: Zillow Revenue(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Zillow is also expanding their portfolio of offerings to cover more aspects of buying, selling, renting and financing, which gives it great potential for economies of scope, although this is not apparent from financial performance so far. Since starting the homes segment, the IMT and Mortgages segments appear to be maintaining trend growth. Zillow will likely be hoping to see strong growth in these segments, particularly mortgages, as the Homes segment continues to expand.Zillow has the opportunity to greatly expand IMT revenue through its dominance in lead generation. Zillow's statistics show that 45% of people who request an offer through Zillow Offers end up listing their home, but Zillow is unable to manage the volume of leads generated. Zillow can potentially sell these leads to agents or receive an industry standard referral fee of approximately 1% if the home sells. To give an idea of the size of the opportunity, Zillow estimates that if Offers was available in the top 200 metro markets, sellers of 2.75 million homes would be eligible, and based on numbers from Phoenix, 15-35% of these would request an offer. This could bring in revenue of approximately $0.5-1 billion with very little associated cost.Figure 3: Zillow Segment Revenue(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)As Zillow's Homes segment expands, the company's gross profit margin is declining rapidly, although the operating profit margin has not been greatly affected. This trend will continue as the Homes segment expands, and Zillow's future profitability will be largely dependent on the unit economics of iBuying.Figure 4: Zillow Profit Margin(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Zillow's move into iBuying is also dramatically expanding the company's balance sheet as it holds housing inventory financed with debt capital. Zillow's success in iBuying will be highly dependent on its ability to rapidly turn its inventory over and avoid inventory write-downs due to falling house prices.Figure 5: Zillow Asset Turnover and Return on Assets(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)iBuying is a difficult business from a working capital perspective as sellers are paid upfront and then Zillow must hold housing in inventory for an extended period as it prepares the home for sale and tries to sell it. This dynamic can be seen in Zillow's rapidly expanding cash conversion cycle.Figure 6: Zillow Cash Conversion Cycle(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Zillow has rarely managed to achieve positive free cash flow, and its large negative cash flows, as it expands its iBuying business, are likely a cause for concern for many. Given the rate at which revenue is currently growing, I do not currently see this as a concern as positive cash flows will come once growth moderates if they are able to make the unit economics work.Figure 7: Zillow Free Cash Flow and Growth(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Zillow takes an approximate 7% fee for their iBuying service and must cover their expenses from this, plus any appreciation that may occur in the home price. This leaves little margin for error in accurately estimating a home's price, managing renovation and selling costs and quickly selling the home. So far, Zillow is making small losses on their homes segment which is not too concerning as there are likely to be teething issues, and Zillow is yet to reap the benefits of economies of scale.Figure 8: Zillow Homes Profit Margin(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Investors should look for a flat or declining trend in Zillow's iBuying costs relative to revenue as the business scales to give an indication of its viability. If home acquisition costs begin to increase, this may indicate Zillow is having to increase its bids due to competitive pressure in the market. Renovation costs should decline as Zillow scales and obtains more favorable pricing with contractors as long as they are able to buy homes in good condition. Holding costs and selling costs should decline through economies of scale, diversification of risk by expanding geographically, and by reducing the time required to sell homes.Figure 9: Zillow Homes Expenses(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)The thin margins in iBuying mean that price estimates must be extremely accurate, which reduces the pool of potential homes. Homes which are unusually expensive or cheap, older homes and homes with unusual features are likely to be excluded due to difficulties pricing them. The median error for Zillow's price estimate of on market homes ranges from 1.2% in Washington DC to 3.6% in San Francisco. It is unclear how Zillow's price estimates compare to competitors, but given their experience in the area, they are likely to be a leader.Figure 10: Accuracy of Zillow Real Estate Price Estimates(source: realestatedecoded)Zillow must also not lose focus on its core IMT segment, which is an important source of cash flow and leads for the other segments. Growth in traffic to the website has slowed in recent years, although this is likely due to Zillow reaching market saturation. Zillow's Homes segment puts it into direct competition with agents which has the potential to alienate IMT's consumer base. Given how dominant Zillow is in the lead generation market, though I do not believe this is a major risk. Zillow's focus on providing agents with high quality leads through excess volume from Zillow Offers is also likely to ensure IMT remains successful.Figure 11: Zillow Website Unique Visitors(source: Created by author using data from Zillow)Zillow's main competitor in iBuying is Opendoor, which was founded in 2014 and is the world's largest iBuyer. So far, Opendoor has raised $1.3 billion in equity and $3 billion in debt, and its last funding round valued it at $3.8 billion. Opendoor is significantly larger than its competitors, and it is still growing rapidly as it expands into new markets. Phoenix is currently the largest market for iBuying with 6% of all transactions by iBuyers and 3% by Opendoor.Figure 12: Opendoor Net Revenue(source: iBuyer Report)It is not known if Opendoor is currently profitable, but their unit economics appear reasonably attractive. These economics are likely to continue to improve through scale and more efficient operations. For example, housing days in inventory declined from 140 in 2015 to 90 days currently.Figure 13: Opendoor Unit Economics Phoenix(source: mikedp)Although Opendoor is currently the largest player in the market, Zillow is gaining rapidly as a result of its strong brand name, dominant position in lead generation and larger financial resources.Table 1: iBuyer Equity Raised(source: Created by author using data from iBuyer Report)Figure 14: Phoenix iBuyer Mark Share 2017-2019(source: iBuyer Report)Figure 15: Number of Homes Purchased in 2018(source: iBuyer Report)I believe Zillow's iBuying business will approach the size of Opendoor's in the next few years, and competitive pressure between the two is likely to increase as growth in the iBuying segment slows. If this occurs, home sellers are likely to benefit, and iBuyers could potentially bid all of their profits away. In this scenario, profitability will only be achievable through better data analytics, superior operational efficiency, and cross selling value-add products and services.Figure 16: iBuyer 2018 Revenue(source: iBuyer Report)Although Zillow is achieving rapid growth its home purchasing strategy appears to be different to Opendoor and OfferPad and could potentially be problematic. Zillow is purchasing more expensive homes than competitors which experience shows are more difficult to value and take longer to sell.Figure 17: iBuyer Median House Purchase Price 2017-2019(source: mikedp)Figure 18: Zillow Home Purchases and Unsold Inventory(source: mikedp)I believe the iBuying market will be fragmented somewhat geographically as the business does not naturally lend itself to scaling across cities and regions. Low profit margins in iBuying mean that profits are only significant at scale, and this is likely to result in a fairly consolidated market, and at this stage, it appears as though Zillow and Opendoors will be the winners.Given the rapid growth that Zillow is likely to achieve over the next 3-5 years, the low margins of their business, even if it is successful, make it difficult to value Zillow with any confidence. The rate of growth, eventual market penetration, profit margin and time taken to achieve profitability will all significantly impact the value of the company. I have estimated an intrinsic value for Zillow of $85 per share, although I do not think this number is particularly important. If the iBuying business model is feasible, then Zillow is undervalued. If it is not, then Zillow is overvalued. If Zillow can effectively monetize their large volume of high quality leads, they are undervalued. If they cannot, they are overvalued."
4210955,103480,2018-10-10T16:02:45-04:00,"Over the past month, shares of Zillow have lost nearly 20%, exceeding declines seen elsewhere in the tech sector.Investors are pinning the fall on sensitivity to interest rates, with Zillow moving deeper into its Instant Offers strategy.Wall Street has never liked Zillow's push into Instant Offers (wherein it takes balance sheet risk by buying up houses), but the rate fears have compounded that dislike.Even large rate moves are unlikely to put a dent in Zillow, whose exposure to homes is actually not large.","Over the past week, the markets have cared about one thing and one thing only: interest rates heading higher. Among a widespread market rout, technology stocks got hit the worst. Investors have taken the pullback as an opportunity to rebalance sector weightings, and winning tech stocks have been the deepest decliners - as evidenced by the NASDAQ's ~6% fall from highs in the span of a week.This makes bargain hunting in a perennially expensive technology sector a bit better. Among the companies that I believe to have fallen too far is Zillow (Z), the online real estate data platform.Zillow is a beaten-down stock and has been all year. The company has been hit with a triple-whammy of news that investors considered unappetizing: first, a string of so-so results that hinted at top-line revenue deceleration; second, a push into proprietary home buying called Instant Offers, announced in April; and most recently, a spike in interest rates.Over the past month, Zillow has lost more than 20%. Ever since hitting a peak of $65 in mid-June, shares of Zillow have lost more than 40%. Year to date, Zillow is also down about 10% - whereas the majority of the technology sector is still up. This seems, to me, a bit overblown.Z data by YChartsIn my view, Zillow is now a highly undervalued stock (a 5.6x forward revenue multiple for a company growing its top line at ~20% y/y, while still producing positive cash flows, is difficult to find in this market) for whom a spike in interest rates will have some impact, but not much.Let's put it this way - over the past month, Zillow has lost some ~$5.5 billion in market value. The question for investors is this: does this loss in market value overcompensate for the risk of higher interest rates?The answer is no - far from it. The selling pressure on Zillow has evolved into hysteria (with the stock dropping as much as 5% daily), but the actual fundamental impacts of a higher interest rate environment don't nearly justify this drop-off. Investors need to be patient with Zillow, as with any heavily unpopular stock - but those willing enough to shoulder a few more quarters of pain have much to gain when Zillow recovers.In Zillow's most recent quarter ending in June, the company reported $394.4 million of long-term debt (it also reported $899.6 million of cash and short-term investments, so it's actually at a net cash position of about half a billion at the moment, but let's ignore that for now. The company also raised $750 million of additional cash through convertible notes in July, which are not yet reflected on the balance sheet).Currently, Zillow's debt burden is small. But part of the negativity on Zillow stems from the thinking that, with Zillow's push into Instant Offers, the company would be loading up mortgage debt on its balance sheet at just the same time as rates are going up.As I noted in a prior article, Zillow initially announced that the Instant offers program would buy up 300-1,000 homes. In the company's most recent quarterly update, however, Zillow has cut that estimate to 300-550 homes, already reducing the scope of a program that investors dislike. In Zillow's core Instant Offers markets, Phoenix and Las Vegas, home prices are still relatively low - let's assume a median price of $250,000 per home, leading to an overall portfolio value of $137.5 million if Zillow ends up purchasing a full 550 homes.This is a tiny blip on Zillow's balance sheet, which after its convertible debt raise has more than $1.5 billion in cash. Investors, however, are overly concerned about the rate impact, as Zillow is financing these purchases with 85% debt. Here's the language from the latest quarterly update letter detailing Zillow's debt facility to support Instant Offers:Putting 85% leverage against $137.5 million in home value implies debt of ~$117 million. Let's assume that all of this debt is floating rate, and that interest rates move up by a full 100bps (they haven't yet). This translates to about $1.2 million in additional annual interest expense - or less than 0.1% of Zillow's revenue guidance of $1.32-$1.35 billion for the current year. If we add in Zillow's current debt of ~$400 million, this implies a total interest impact of ~$5 million - which is still an insignificant chunk of Zillow's revenues.So, clearly, we shouldn't be too concerned about higher interest rates eating into Zillow's earnings.The interest expense rationale ignores one key piece: the possibility that home values may decline as interest rates go up. In the past, real estate values and interest rates have often seen an inverse relationship. In addition to rising interest expenses, investors are also concerned that Zillow is buying up homes at the peak and could suffer from capital losses as we head into a period of stagnant home prices.Here again, we have to emphasize that Zillow's proposed Instant Offers scope of up to 550 homes is minuscule, barely reaching over $100 million in total portfolio value (depending on what we assume the average home price is). Zillow isn't buying multi-family apartments or shopping centers - it's buying cheap, easily sellable single-family homes. Even if the company suffered a 10% loss on this portfolio (which would be a major decline in any real estate market, taking us back to 2008's declines), it would still be a blip to the company's overall financial picture (~$1.33 billion in revenues and ~$240 million in EBITDA).In any case, the possible loss of principal itself is limited thanks to Zillow's short-term approach to Instant Offers. The company has noted that it doesn't intend on keeping any home longer than 90 days. Zillow noted the following in its latest quarterly update (emphasis added):The quick turnaround that Zillow expects to execute on its home purchases will likely shield it from any sustained, long-term reduction in home values driven by higher interest rates.Zillow has lost $5.5 billion in market value over the past few months, about ~$2 billion of which was lost in the past two weeks over interest rate fears. As we've discussed in this article, the actual impact on higher interest rates driving higher interest expense is actually small, perhaps leading to up to ~$5 million in added interest expenses per year. As for portfolio losses in a higher interest rate environment, Zillow's Instant Offers program will be a small enough piece of the company's balance sheet that the possibility of principal losses, too, will be limited. This is especially true because of the short-term (<90 days) nature of Instant Offers, which will make a sustained portfolio loss highly improbable.The selloff, in my view, has heavily overdramatized the impacts of interest rates on Zillow's financials. The company still remains a capital-light business that generates the majority of its revenues from advertisements and premier Agent subscriptions. Stay long on this fantastic name."

In 2017, the company reported 27% revenue growth amounting to $1.076 billion with total costs growing at 19%. Zillow reported net losses of -$94 million, which value investors may not appreciate. With that, the company is losing less money as compared to 2016 when Zillow lost $220 million. The image below provides further details on this matter:Source: 10-KIn the most recent quarter released, the company continued to release revenue growth. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the company released 21.7% increase in total revenues as compared to the same quarter in 2017. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the company released a revenue increase of 21.8%. Revenue growth was more significant in 2017, but Zillow is still growing at a high pace. The image below provides further details on this matter:Source: 10-QThe company is reporting positive Adjusted EBITDA, equal to $168 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. It is growing, but not significantly. In the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Adjusted EBITDA was equal to $165 million. The image below provides further details on this matter:Source: 10-QRegarding the cash flow statement, value investors should appreciate the company. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, Zillow released positive but declining CFO, equal to $102 million. The same figure in 2017 was equal to $176 million. The image below provides further details on this matter:Source: 10-QThe balance sheet is quite beneficial. On September 30, 2018, Zillow released 30% increase in the amount of total assets and a massive increase in the amount of cash and short-term investments. The cash and the amount of short-investments add $1.642 billion, 155% more than that in December 2017. The image below provides further details:Source: 10-QIn addition, Zillow shows a large amount of goodwill, 45% of the total amount of assets. The company is very active in the M&A market, which seems beneficial. If Zillow is able to make a good post-merger integration of the new companies acquired, shareholders should benefit in the long run. The lines below provide further details:- On September 6, 2017, Zillow, Inc. acquired New Home Feed, Inc. The value of the transaction was not given. Goodwill was equal to $3.6 million, and identifiable intangible assets were equal to $1.9 million.- On January 11, 2017, Zillow, Inc. acquired substantially all the operating assets of RealNet Solutions, Inc. Goodwill was equal to $4.0 million.- In February 2016, the company acquired Naked Apartments for $13 million. The image below provides further details on this transaction. Note that the goodwill registered was very significant, which may be a risk as well. If the accountants believe that the assets worth less, the assets will be impaired, which could lead to share price declines:Source: 10-K- On July 28, 2014, the company also released the acquisition of Trulia, Inc. for $3.5 billion. The image below provides further details on the assets acquired. Note again that the goodwill was equal to almost 89%, which may worry certain financial analysts.Source: 10-KOn the liability side, investors should note that liabilities are also growing at a high pace. In the last quarterly release, the total amount of liabilities increased by 55% as compared to the same quarter in 2017. With that, as of today, the liabilities do not represent a problem. Total liabilities equal $883 million, and assets are worth $4.202 billion. The company’s financial situation seems stable. The image below provides further details on this matter:Source: 10-QWith several banks targeting very low price marks, investors should study the trades of institutional investors carefully. The truth is that the smart money does not seem to be negative about Zillow. The institutional investors’ ownership equals more than 80% as shown in the image below:Source: YchartsThat’s not all. On November 26, 2018, one of the directors acquired 850,000 shares worth $25 million. With this in mind, it seems time to buy Zillow.Source: Seeking AlphaThe company has three different share classes, which most investors will not appreciate. The lines below provide further details on the amount of shares outstanding:As of November 27, 2018, assuming 203 million shares outstanding at $33.48, the market capitalization equals $6.796 billion. Deducting $1.642 billion in cash and short-term investments and adding $0.69 billion in long term debt, the enterprise value equals $5.84 billion. Let’s assume 21% increase in revenues, so forward revenues are worth $1.3 billion. Using this figure, the company trades at 4.49x forward sales.There are not many companies that can be compared with Zillow. Redfin (RDFN) trades at 3.11x sales with gross profit margin of 26.69% and revenue growth of 34.45%. With this in mind, Zillow should trade a bit higher than 4.49x sales. Keep in mind that the company’s gross profit margin is 82.65%, which is more than two times that of Redfin. Additionally, Zillow receives more visitors than Redfin, and the company’s stats are better.With Redfin trading at 3.11x sales, Zillow should trade at more than 4.49x sales. Keep in mind that Zillow receives more than four times more visitors. Additionally, its gross profit margin is more than two times larger than that of Redfin.With that, institutional investors bought the stock long time ago and nobody seemed to sell shares. Finally, with a director buying $25 million in stock at $29-$30, the company seems to be a buy for many individuals. Can a bad quarter destroy the beneficial revenue growth of four years?"
4221144,100666,2018-11-11T20:33:57-05:00,"Zillow's drop of more than 50% brought it back to a level not seen since May 2016.After a look at the company and its stock price performance, we look at the recent Q3 2018 results.We look at three reasons Zillow has fallen so hard: Zillow Offers, the Premier Agent slow down and the Q4 guidance.Zillow has a long-term vision of becoming the reference platform for everything related to real estate and if that works out there is a high possible reward. But there are risks attached.","What was away for a few years, is completely back, with a vengeance, in this market recently: volatility. Dramatic drops of 20% or more on a single day are no longer an exception. You see them almost every day now, often even from huge companies like Facebook (FB). Sometimes these drops are the result of inflated stock prices, but also often because of sentiment. Some of these drops present an excellent opportunity to buy quality at a lower price.Zillow (Z) (ZG) has fallen to its lowest point since May 2016 and just 9% above its price of August of 2015, when the stock started trading under this construction of voting and non-voting shares. Such a big drop seems attractive, but price doesn't tell you everything, of course. Quality is a major selection criterion, not just price. In this article I will explore if Zillow has the necessary quality to be bought right now.But first, an brief introduction to Zillow for those who don't know it that well. It is a well-known provider of digital marketplaces for real estate services.Zillow started in 2005 and launched in 2006. This is a timeline of the first years:Zillow has a whole bunch of products. This is an overview of the consumer products:(Source: zillowgroup.com)Zillow and Trulia are the best known products. Trulia used to be a competitor of Zillow, but Zillow acquired it and became Zillow Group as a consequence. Although both are quite similar, they seem to be getting other customers. Both Zillow and Trulia are free and provide guesstimates of what your house could be worth, zestimates in Zillow's vocabulary. Trulia was the second biggest, but the overlap of Zillow and Trulia was surprisingly small at the time of the acquisition:(From the 2014 press announcement of the acquisition, bold added by FGTV)I'm pretty sure that in the meantime the overlap has become bigger, but still Zillow and Trulia seem to offer their services to different audiences.Because of the split in Zillow and Zillow Group, we can only look at the performance of the stock since February 2015:ZYChartsAs you can see, the stock has had quite a volatile trajectory. Most of the time its stock price return was above the market, but the huge recent drop made it an underperformer. It is only up 9% now over three and a half years, which is not the kind of return you expect from a growth company.To put the drop into more perspective, this is the chart since June 15th:ZYChartsThe recent plunge made that the stock trades at its lowest point since May 2016.Does this mean that Zillow is in trouble? Not at all. The stock is down on what brings most stocks down: fear. Investors are worried about a few things, which I will come back to later in this article to evaluate them one by one.But first let's have a look at the most recent results, which caused an extra 20% drop. Revenues grew 22% YoY, which is still a great performance in my book and only missing $1M to analysts' consensus. For a total revenue of $343M, that is less than a 1% miss. I call that meeting expectations. But analysts call this a miss and misses are always bad publicity for company's stock prices.The premier agent segment grew by 18% to $232.7M, the rentals segment grew by 31% to $37.3M, mortgages went down by 12% to $18.4M and the 'other' category grew by 23% to $43.6M. 'Homes', of which Zillow Offers is a part, produced $11 million of revenue.What I always find interesting to hear about are cash and equivalents. On the Q3 earnings conference call, Spencer Rascoff said:$1.6B with 138.16M shares, that means $11.58 of cash and investments per share. Not unimportant for a stock with a share price of around $30. Zillow's total liabilities are up to 883M, only 21% of the total market cap. And with 1.6B in cash and equivalents, Zillow could pay off debts anytime it would want. This should give some confidence to investors. And it most certainly shows that Zillow is not in trouble. There must be other reasons for the big drop than financial troubles, that is for sure.The first reason that Zillow dropped was Zillow Offers, the new house flipping business Zillow has started up. The mortgage business was already controversial for investors, but the house flipping business only added to what investors and analysts consider to be a much more fluctuating environment.The advantage of Zillow has been until recently that it had an asset-light platform. It is more a tech or an advertisement company than a real estate company and that is one of the reasons the stocks sports a high forward P/E ratio of 39 (and a negative ttm PE ratio) even after such a big drop.The markets don't seem to like the Zillow Offers. But I actually do. It seems a logical step for Zillow to monetize its huge data collection. Spencer Rascoff, Zillow's CEO, pitched it in a CNBC interview with Jim Cramer as Netflix moving into original content.I think Netflix is actually a good example. It too switched from an asset-light to an asset-heavy platform, but was able to leverage its customers base because of this. After all: the total focus of Netflix's CEO Reed Hastings on streaming in 2011-2012, dumping DVDs in Quikster and raising prices by 60% cratered the stock with 77%. Wall Street is a strange place: it is the altar of capitalism, but at the same time companies that take bold steps are slaughtered on that same altar.It has been said before: data are the new oil. To pump up an oil well can be a nasty job too, but it will be rewarded later if it works out. Zillow wants to revolutionize the buying and selling of a house even more than it has already done. Therefor it has to wade deeper into the muddy waters of the real estate market. It wants people to be able to buy a house with a click.I remember the early days of Amazon (AMZN): people were never going to buy online. Using your credit or debit card on the net? No way! And once that obstacle proved false, the next argument was that people would buy small, relatively cheap things online, but never bigger of more expensive items. Each time these negative forecasts turned out to be wrong, although the adoption rate sometime looked rather slow. The thing is, with these kind of things there is a tipping point. Until that tipping point, it goes slow. But once the tipping point has been reached, the landslide follows. I think the same might happen to Instant Offers over the longer term.I had already thought about Instant Offers for a while. Somewhere in the first months of 2017 I read Zillow Talk, Rewriting The Rules Of Real Estate, the 2015 book of Zillow's CEO Spencer Rascoff and Zillow's Chief Analytics Officer (then Chief Economist).(Zillow Talk cover, source)I was already impressed by not only the amount of data Zillow could gather, but also the trends, the predictions about which houses would sell and which not, their zestimates that became more and more accurate (at the time just 7% difference on average with the selling price) etc.Just as Netflix knows so much about the viewing habits of its clients, Zillow knows knows more than anybody else about real estate. By becoming a house flipper themselves, they can refine that knowledge even more with their top-notch, unrivaled algorithms. What is not to like?Zillow Offers bought 168 homes and sold 36 in the quarter. This is still a very small part of the company, but I think Zillow Offers might grow to the main business over time, but not anytime soon. If the model works, why would you pay an expensive real estate agent as a seller? You can get cash immediately. As Spencer Rascoff said during the conference call:I agree with this. The only question I still have is the buyer's side. Will Zillow Offers convince enough people to buy from Zillow? 36 sold of 168 are not numbers to be incredibly optimistic. My take is that they will, but that it will need (a lot of?) time to gain confidence and to convince people of the Zillow Offers model. It could be a long road towards the tipping point.Another reason for the drop is Premier Agent, the main contributor to Zillow's revenue.(Source: Q3 2018 earnings slides)As you can see on the pie chart, 71% of the revenue of Zillow comes from Premier Agent. It is Zillow's (paying) advertising platform for real estate agents that connects them with clients who want to buy a house or sell one.Premier Agent's revenue contribution disappointed as well, for a lot of analysts. Although the revenue was up 18% YoY, a Susquehanna analyst said that the results are ""the clearest evidence yet that the core Premier Agent business is in trouble"". In the last quarter, Premier Agent's revenue was up 22% and so the growth decreases. What is more, the increase QoQ was just 0.78%. That is probably what the analyst was referring to. But I think he has just looked at the numbers and not at the underlying reason. If he had, he probably would have had a more nuanced view. (Or would being moderate be against his own interest?)Spencer Rascoff gave on the earnings call an explanation that not only makes sense, but even is a positive for Zillow if it works out. I have to give a long quote to give you the full story, but I will highlight a few things in bold for those who want to scan:This explanation makes sense, although there is, of course, still some risk involved. Will the prediction turn out to be correct? Wait and see in the next few quarters, especially Q1 2019, as Rascoff indicated.The Q4 guidance was considered weak by most analysts. Zillow guided to revenues of $340M-$357M, versus a consensus of $367.8M and EBITDA of $26M to $38M. For the full year 2018 it thinks revenues will be $1.307B to $1.324B, versus a consensus of $1.34B.I think that these small misses in guidance are often given too much weight. In this case 20% of the stock price was blown off. Especially if you read why the growth slowed, I think investors shouldn't be too afraid.But it is a fact that both Zillow Offers and the new Premier Agent formula have created fear in the mind of many investors. And probably the rising rates also play a role in two ways: less people buying houses and a direct impact on the mortgage business of Zillow, which a lot of investors didn't like to start with. The revenue of the mortgage division was down 12% YoY, so this actually confirms the fears of investors.I have seen time and again that new concepts and first movers have experienced difficult times each time they introduce a new feature (or several), no matter how correct the direction might be. I think that this is the case with Zillow. I like the Zillow Offers and it seems a logical evolution to me, but logical doesn't mean simple.Only time will tell if the market is ready for this new model. Over the long term I have no doubts, but will it convince over the short term, or will Zillow be obliged to shut it down after a few years of languishing? That is something we can not be sure of. I have a gut feeling that the market starts to be ready for this, but that is just my very subjective feeling. I think Zillow Offers might be the correct direction over time, much more than the Premier Agent service. But it will take years or even decades before the model is accepted by home buyers.If this turns out to be true and Zillow will become the omni-channel platform for real estate that it wants to become, the stock really is a bargain now. If Zillow can not convince the real estate market clients, then it could be a flop, even over the long term. Probably another company will jump at it then and with just a few adaptations to Zillow Offers be the new king in this segment.What I have done is an approach I have learned from Buffett and a few other investors: I have purchased a very small number of stocks. In Buffett's case that is sometimes 100 or 1000, in my case it is 3. I think percentage-wise in our portfolios that must be around the same number. The reason I do this, is because then I have the tendency to follow the stock more closely than if it is just on my watch list. I want to see how Zillow Offers and the adapted Premier Agent features evolve over the next few quarters. Having heard Spencer Rascoff quite a few times now in interviews, having read his book and having seen the direction he has taken the company, I think he will pull the trick. But with this volatile market and the soft guidance for Q4, there might be even lower prices on the horizon for Zillow.The house flipping business Zillow has gotten into with Zillow offers is for me the right direction if you look at the enormous amounts of data Zillow has. Just like Netflix entering the original content space, this is not a short-term play, but a long-term vision. Those tend to turn out positive more often than not. But they also create uncertainty and volatility, as investors actually have to valuate the company and its stock with new standards. That may take time.I think the end game is not just house flipping, but becoming the Amazon of real estate, with more and more diverse divisions, with something for everyone, as a market place where people automatically turn to buy or sell houses. That is a huge ambition, but if it works out, as it did with Amazon and Netflix, it could be hugely rewarding for investors of Zillow.If you liked this article and would like to get more articles written from a long-term perspective, please feel free to hit the follow button.In the meantime, keep growing!"
4207755,103480,2018-09-23T14:14:56-04:00,"Zillow has faced a host of downgrades and investor pessimism since last quarter, when a slower ramp of its controversial home-flipping business (Instant Offers) led to a miss on guidance.Additional concerns about a slowdown in residential real estate have also driven pessimism for Zillow, despite the fact that its revenue streams are largely insulated from a home sales downturn.Zillow also recently launched property management tools that offer an additional, diversified recurring revenue stream, further insulating Zillow from the real estate cycle.The company is down 35% over the last three months alone.","It's no secret that the Internet space has been taking a beating over the past few months. Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) have both fallen hard on regulatory pressure as well as a re-classification into the new so-called ""communications services"" sector, and Netflix (NFLX) is still reeling from a bad subscriber print in its most recent quarter. Only Amazon (AMZN) continues to defy gravity, with its valuation expanding much faster than its profit growth.Among the hardest-hit internet names, in my opinion, is long overdue for a rebound, and that name is Zillow (Z). I began steadily building a position in this online real estate leader after its Q2 guidance fiasco, and continue to believe this stock represents one of the best values in an otherwise expensive internet sector.Make no mistake - Zillow is not without its fair share of issues. Most controversial among these is the rollout of Zillow Instant Offers, which is a new Zillow program targeted in certain markets that will offer to buy homes from Zillow users with the goal of eventually flipping them.Unsurprisingly, investors resisted Zillow's expansion of Instant Offers. They decried the balance sheet risk it entails, as well as the lumpiness of its revenue streams. I have always thought of Instant Offers as purely additive to Zillow's revenue growth, especially as its core advertising revenue streams saturate and begin to slow down. If the investing public is praising Blackstone (BX) for its push into residential real estate (a big driver of home-price increases in 2017 and 2018 has been the entry of large buy-side firms, buying up thousands of single-family homes via targeted screening algorithms), why don't we trust Zillow to have similar success?Equally confusing is the fact that even though investors punished Zillow's stock for expanding Instant Offers, investors also punished the company for a lackluster Q3 guidance last quarter in connection with a slower Instant Offers rollout. In my view, Zillow has been twice punished unfairly and is long overdue for a rebound.Though I've sustained losses on my position, I remain fervently long on Zillow. Recall that Zillow has one of the largest data assets in the real estate industry. Almost every prospective home buyer or renter passes through one of Zillow's sites to do their research, and Zillow has become an irreplaceable marketing channel for real estate agents and mortgage lenders. The value of this data - and the audience it attracts - is, in my view, worth much more than Zillow's present ~$6 billion market cap. Real estate is a huge space, and so far the underpenetration of the technology sector into real estate presents huge opportunities for Zillow, especially as it rolls out new revenue-generating products such as property management tools. Zillow may have fallen out of favor now, but its long-term story is still very much intact.Recall that it wasn't long ago that Zillow was a top-performing stock. It notched all-time highs as recently as June, when the stock briefly soared above $65. Since then, shares have plummeted more than 35%:Z data by YChartsZillow is now trading at just over 6x forward revenues, at a time when the rest of the internet and software sectors have greatly ballooned in their valuations.In addition, Zillow's profits and margins are still in the process of expanding, and against that backdrop, Zillow's ~30x forward EBITDA multiple also represents a tremendous opportunity. Gross margins in its core advertising business, after all, are sky-high and carry tremendous unit economics.To some degree, Zillow has become highly correlated with fellow online real estate company Redfin (RDFN), despite their vastly differing business models. All real estate technology stocks, in turn, have fallen on widespread fears of a housing slowdown.The National Association of Realtors, most commonly referred to as NAR, released its highly authoritative, monthly report on home sales last week. In that report, the company noted that existing-home sales are down 1.5% y/y.Two primary factors are to blame, and they're the same factors that have been driving the meager home-sales action all year. Inventory remains low, and limited supply of both existing homes and new construction have dampened listing volumes. In recent months, however, the demand side of the equation has also seen a shift: rising interest rates, as well as a broader realization of the Trump tax code (which no longer allows for full deduction of property taxes, by capping both state/local and property taxes to a maximum of $10,000 in deductions) has driven many would-be buyers to renting.This is really bad news for a company like Redfin, which depends on real estate commissions to drive revenues. It wouldn't be surprising for Redfin's growth to decelerate meaningfully over the next few quarters (perhaps even dip into negative territory), as its small market share gains can't forever cancel out a broader slowdown in the housing market.These same concerns, however, largely don't apply to Zillow. In fact, with many real estate agents facing the prospect of lower sales, they might choose to increase their advertising activities in an effort to drum up business, which helps Zillow's Premier Agent business. The real estate market has always been prone to boom-and-bust cycles, but Zillow's revenue streams are somewhat uncorrelated - as long as agents keep advertising, Zillow can keep growing.Zillow's most recent efforts into property management tools, in my opinion, is a far more worthwhile news item for investors to be focusing on. Over the past few months, Zillow has broadened its intentions of moving into the rental services/software space.The new Zillow tools offer an all-in-one solution for the rental process. On the renter side, prospective renters can now submit a single application for multiple properties, which includes a background check and landlord eviction history as well as the standard credit checks that are typically done by a human landlord or management company. Aside from the upfront application, Zillow also offers a host of ongoing tools to smooth the rental process, including the ability to pay rent online via Zillow.Property management is a large business. Almost every apartment complex, and even many single-family investment properties (including several of mine) are managed by professional property managers. Zillow's tools are still nascent, but have the ability to disrupt a multi-billion dollar industry that is largely paper-based and underpenetrated by technology.And best of all, Zillow's tools are scalable. Unlike Redfin - which requires increased realtor hires in order to drive growth into new markets - Zillow's technology platform can grow enormously without adding significant operating expenses. As revenue growth in Premier Agent slows down (and even if real estate advertising faces a cyclical downturn), Zillow can take advantage of the rising tide in rentals to capture a new, diversified revenue stream.While a pullback in Zillow from its June highs was likely a healthy move for the long-term growth of the stock, the ~35% drop it's sustained since has gone too far. Zillow's invaluable data platform now incorporates a wide breadth of fast-growing revenue opportunities, from its core advertising business to rental management and Instant Offers.Remain long on Zillow. Virtually no other company has the data asset that Zillow has, nor its brand dominance among consumers. It won't be difficult for Zillow to touch new all-time highs within the next year."
4219202,103480,2018-11-07T05:04:06-05:00,"Shares of Zillow crashed nearly 20% after reporting weak Q3 results, as well as light guidance for Q4.Investors balked at the company's rate of deceleration, mostly due to a slower ramp of Zillow Instant Offers (a program investors are queasy about).Currently, the Instant Offers playbook has expanded to seven cities, with new additions in Houston, Charlotte, and Raleigh.Investors were also spooked by bearish commentary on the company's flagship Premier Agent business.Zillow shares are now down more than 50% from recent highs, giving the stock a tremendously favorable valuation.","It's been an extremely painful year to be a Zillow (Z) investor. The real estate website suffered its second huge one-day loss this year after reporting mixed Q3 results that missed Wall Street's revenue estimates; and adding further insult to injury, Zillow also guided low for Q4.Let's cut to the chase: I'm extremely long on Zillow. The short term may be painful, but Zillow's long-term thesis remains very much intact. Virtually no other company has the data assets that Zillow has, nor its brand power. Across its portfolio of sites - including other heavy hitters like Trulia and StreetEasy in New York - the modern homebuyer, and even renter, can't avoid doing research on Zillow before making a real estate transaction. That's why, for realtors and other real estate professionals, having an advertising presence on Zillow is key.After falling 20% in after-hours trading and extending a harsh 50% decline from its peak, shares of Zillow are trading at two-year lows:Z data by YChartsWhile I acknowledge that Zillow's quarter could certainly have been better, the continued selling pressure on the stock exaggerates an already-overstated pullback. It may take several quarters for Zillow to get back on track, but for a company with this much consumer popularity and with such vast proprietary data, a recovery is nearly guaranteed.Two items thoroughly spooked investors during Q3 earnings: first, a light guidance view for Q4, and related to that, commentary on softness in Zillow's Premier Agent business - which, to date, is the largest driver of Zillow's revenues.In Zillow's Q3 shareholder letter, the company wrote as follows (key points highlighted):Zillow is not the first internet company to begin tweaking its business model this year, and almost each of its predecessors saw a similar plunge in stock prices. Snapchat (SNAP) toyed with how users see the primary Story feed. Trivago (TRVG) greatly changed its advertising model and saw a large contraction in site visits as a response.In Zillow's case, however, management believes that the issues in the business are ""temporary and solvable,"" and noted that ""we have already made changes to improve advertiser retention and drive acceptance of the new model."" As previously mentioned, there are simply so few alternatives for Zillow out there on the internet. Like it or not, Zillow is the dominant platform where consumers spend their time before making a purchase decision. Especially amid a slowing real estate market, driven by rising rates and persistently low housing inventory, real estate agents will be angling to get in front of homebuyers to win more deals.It's worth noting that in Q3, Zillow's group of sites hosted 1.9 billion site visits alone, up 13% y/y. Visits to Zillow.com, meanwhile, were up 22% y/y in September. These are powerful traffic metrics that will eventually shepherd agents and advertisers back onto the Zillow platform.The resulting outlook for Zillow's fourth quarter could have been better: but a ~20% stock plunge in response to a single quarter's guidance during a particularly jarring business shift is an overreaction.Figure 1. Zillow 4Q18 guidanceSource: Zillow investor relationsZillow is expecting total revenues of $340-$357 million, which at the midpoint of that range is still up 23% y/y over 4Q17 revenues of $282.3 million. Premier Agent midpoint revenues of $223 million are also up 12% y/y over 4Q17's $199 million. Wall Street was expecting slightly higher total revenues of $367.8 million (+30% y/y). All told, while the guidance certainly disappointed, it wasn't disappointing enough to merit a 20% crash - especially when management already warned that Q4 suffers from seasonality. Zillow has also noted that it is confident advertiser churn will return to normal levels in 2019.Here's a look at Zillow's performance in Q3:Figure 2. Zillow 3Q18 resultsSource: Zillow investor relationsTotal revenues grew 22% y/y to $343.1 million, keeping pace with last quarter's revenue growth. Premier Agent revenues, however - Zillow's bread and butter, and its largest margin generator - decelerated to 18% y/y growth, down from 22% last quarter. Wall Street was expecting slightly stronger total revenues in the quarter of $344.2 million, or a negligible 40bps lower than Zillow's actual results.The Homes segment is also beginning to contribute to Zillow's growth, generating its first-ever quarterly revenues of $11.0 million in Q3. Zillow's Instant Offers strategy is the other big reason that investors are shying away from the company, but in my view, Instant Offers is net accretive to both the top and bottom lines. Flipping homes is obviously not a risk-free business, but if any entity is equipped to reduce transactional risk through extensive data, it's Zillow. Zillow also reported that it ended the quarter with 151 homes on its balance sheet and just under $25 million of debt drawn on its credit line, which is actually small relative to Zillow's ~$1.3 billion annual revenue scale.Zillow also disclosed some new key points on its Instant Offers strategy: it's targeting a long-term net profit of 1-2% on a per-unit basis. It also charges home sellers a 6-9% fee on homes sold to Zillow Offers, essentially giving Zillow a transactional revenue stream that works just like a real estate agent's fee. It's not just buying every home that comes across its desk, however - Zillow noted that it has received interest from ""nearly 20,000"" home sellers, and has purchased just about 1% of these.Zillow's expense growth in the quarter compressed its EBITDA expansion. The company reported a 30% y/y increase in general and administrative expenses and a 26% y/y increase in technology and development costs, respectively. As a result, Zillow's EBITDA fell -7% y/y to $66.1 million, while EBITDA margins retreated to 19%, down 6 points from the year-ago quarter.Investors should be patient with Zillow, however, as it tweaks its Premier Agent delivery model and begins to ramp up its Homes segment. Its near-term results aren't going to be indicative of the company's long-term growth trajectory.I keep buying shares of Zillow on every dip, and though I concede that Zillow's third-quarter results and Q4 guidance were slightly disappointing, these are near-term hurdles that pose no threats to the company's long-term future. I'd be more concerned if Zillow's traffic numbers were slowing down or if a major competitor came onto the playing field, but in Zillow's case, its only a slight and temporary dip in agents and advertisers in a period of slowing real estate activity. With billions of homebuyers swarming Zillow's sites on a quarterly basis, eventually these advertisers will return- Zillow is one of the best sources of leads in the real estate industry.Recall that Zillow's management is hopeful that normal rates of churn will return in 2019, and that year-end seasonality will have an outsized impact on Q3 and Q4's growth rates. Zillow is not in the midst of a longer-term, secular decline; it's still the dominant player in real estate technology. Stay long on this fantastic name."

Why? Two reasons:In my latest report, The Future of Real Estate Portals, I provide a strategic framework for how to think about portals expanding into new businesses. There are two ways: Getting involved in more of the transaction, and getting closer to the transaction.There are two big examples of real estate portals making big moves to get closer to the transaction: Zillow's Instant Offers program, and REA Group's acquisition of mortgage broker Smartline. Zillow's announcement today is yet another major - and not unexpected - move in that direction. That's a big deal - it's a clear signal of intent and strategy, and one that no other portal is matching around the globe - yet.What we are seeing is the result of a strategic shift at Zillow, likely started in 2017, and now moving full-speed ahead. It's an intentional move to get closer to the transaction in all areas of the business, and move away from simply being a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers. It's a move from search engine to service engine. And it's a move to larger revenue pools. Zillow's existing mortgage lead gen business generates about $4 per lead. Mortgage origination can generate hundreds to thousands of dollars per customer.It's a big move. While all the iBuyers talk about providing mortgage solutions to streamline the process, no one has purchased an existing mortgage broker. This isn't testing the waters, it's jumping straight in and hoping for the best.I believe one of the big drivers of Zillow's strategic shift was the slowing growth of its flagship premier agent program. As I've written about in the past, it's naturally slowing down.To Zillow's credit, with slowing growth in its main revenue driver, it did two things:The first action opened up new areas of growth. The second arrested the decline and stabilized the premier agent program.There are a number of key takeaways from Zillow's latest move:"
4205788,102795,2018-09-12T12:33:13-04:00,"Last week, News Corporation, owner of realtor.com in the U.S. and the majority owner of REA Group in Australia, announced the $210 million acquisition of lead qualification service Opcity.Opcity features a referral fee business model where customers are worth 36x more than a lead.A concierge, lead qualification model provides a superior experience for consumers and agents. And for agents, it delivers a superior return on investment.","Last week, News Corporation (NWSA) (NASDAQ:NWS), owner of realtor.com in the U.S. and the majority owner of REA Group in Australia, announced the $210-million acquisition of lead qualification service Opcity.Why it matters: With this acquisition, realtor.com dives deeper into the lead conversion funnel in a major way. Opcity features a referral fee business model where customers are worth 36x more than a lead - which highlights why the U.S. portals are diving deeper into the funnel.Zillow (Z)(ZG) and realtor.com are both lead generators. They drive traffic to their websites, advertise real estate agents, and generate leads in the form of consumers who are looking to buy a house. This is the lion’s share of their revenues and the core of their business models.The conversion of leads to actual, paying customers is left up to individual real estate agents, and nominally occurs offline. But this is changing.In Zillow’s last earnings update, it shared its goal of ""moving beyond lead generation and actively evolving toward being a deeper funnel real estate industry partner.” It launched a new, super-charged concierge service where Zillow sales reps qualify leads before matching them with a premier agent.Source: Zillow investor presentation.News Corporation’s acquisition of Opcity is the same move: deeper down the funnel. Opcity takes raw leads, qualifies them, and then matches them with an agent. It does not charge per lead, like Zillow or realtor.com, but charges a referral fee for any leads that turn into paying customers (typically 30-35% of a buyer’s agent commission).The cost per lead on Zillow ranges from $20 to $220. I estimate the average to be around $55 per lead. For Opcity, assuming a $250,000 home, a buyer’s agent commission of 2.75%, and a 30% referral fee, each customer is worth around $2,000 - or 36x higher than the value of a lead.The rationale for Zillow and realtor.com to move deeper down the funnel is simple: a better experience.In the case of both Zillow's concierge service and Opcity, consumers are able to speak to a human being faster, and are matched (not just sent) to an agent faster. Agents are matched with pre-qualified consumers, saving them time and energy. Plus the return on investment for the concierge model is far superior to simply buying leads.At first glance, the Opcity and referral fee model may seem like a bad deal. Why would an agent pay 30-35% of their commission (around $2,000 for an average transaction) for a referral when they can buy leads for a fraction that price?It comes down to the math. Buying leads and converting them to customers cost an agent, on average, around $7,500 per customer - compared to $2,000 for a customer through Opcity.Source: Author's estimates based on industry data, Opcity public metrics, and Zillow's FY16 financial results.It all comes down to the conversion rate. Operating at scale and singularly focused on doing one job, Opcity and Zillow have the scale and technology advantage to convert leads more quickly and efficiently. They have call centers, teams, data, and a long list of agents if the first one contacted doesn’t answer the phone. It's no surprise their conversion rate is higher.So how big is the opportunity from a revenue standpoint? (The analysis below is based on Zillow, simply because there is so much more data available, but the same logic applies to realtor.com and Opcity.)Back in FY16, when Zillow last reported the figure, it generated around 17 million leads during the year. If we assume Opcity’s 4% lead conversation rate (between 3x-5x the industry norm of 1%) and a 30% referral fee, those 17 million leads are worth $1.4 billion in revenue to Zillow (about 50% higher than the ~ $930 million in current premier agent revenues today).Source: Author's estimates based on industry data, Opcity public metrics, Zillow's FY16 financial results.Both Zillow and realtor.com can better monetize their leads if they qualify them and adopt a referral fee structure. Realtor.com now has that option through Opcity.Given the industry upheaval it would create, it's unlikely that Zillow would change its fee structure. Rather, it will likely approach the same commission rate through the existing premier agent program and share-of-voice bidding system (similar to Google AdWords). Zillow will get there in the end, but through a different path: by providing more value to agents and growing the revenue per lead.The core of this entire model is the buyer lead, which only works in markets where there are buyers' agents. In international markets like the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand - where there are only listing agents - buyer leads are not nearly as valuable.A similar lead qualification service still has merit for seller leads, when consumers are looking for a listing agent (see Homelight, OpenAgent, or REA Group’s Agent Finder service). But real estate portals generate significantly fewer seller leads with a lower intent.To sum it up for portals: Pay close attention to lead qualification if you operate in a market where you can monetize buyer leads. It's a superior experience with a big revenue opportunity.For anyone involved in this sector, there are a number of key takeaways:"
4196895,57252,2018-08-09T02:20:32-04:00,"Zillow is making a large strategic investment into mortgage origination.
        This is part of Zillow's strategy to make a human-light real estate model to appeal to millennials.
        Mortgage origination is a fine business, but Zillow will have to execute well.
        Zillow Offers looks like a risky model.
        Revenue is growing quickly, but I think FCF is multiple years away, so I am staying away from the company's shares.","Shares of Zillow (Z) fell after the company guided to top and bottom line well below consensus expectations while simultaneously announcing an acquisition in an adjacency. Although the guidance was some cause for concern, I believe the strategic decision to enter into mortgage originations is part of a broader plan of digitizing as much of the home buying process as possible. Overall, I like the deal at first glance, and I think Zillow’s strategy is fundamentally sound. Let’s take a look at how the deal transforms the business, how millennials hate certain types of social interaction, but why I am not taking a position in the company even after the drop.Mortgage origination is not a glamorous process –typically contact someone at a bank or a third party like Guaranteed Rate or another originator that has ties to your real estate agent. They get you a quote on a mortgage rate, and you in turn pay them fees. The originators take very little credit risk, and more likely than not, your mortgage will get traded around as part of a securitized portfolio until the obligation no longer exists.The likes of Wells Fargo (WFC), PNC (PNC), and Guild all perform this service, but ultimately, I think customers are fairly fluid. There is very little brand value, and most companies compete on fees, level of service, and convenience. Much of this business is referral based either from real estate agents or a service like Zillow or Redfin (RDFN).By purchasing Mortgage Lenders of America, Zillow will immediately become a viable option for consumers looking for a mortgage. I see two issues here: 1.) This business cannibalizes Zillow’s existing lead referral business and 2.) Zillow will have to deliver a level of service worthy of using.If you have been through the mortgage process recently, then you are well aware that there are varying levels of service. Some firms have solid support staffs that pester the buyer for necessary documentation and truly quarterback the deal process. Other firms run with much leaner staffs, and though the homebuyer can save on fees, the headache and effort on their end can increase substantially. Since it is often seen as a one-time fee that generally looks irrelevant relative to the larger purchase value, I think consumers are unconsciously able to pay a premium.All of this is to say that, yes; Zillow may be able to generate excellent deal flow because of its strong web presence. However, execution will be key, and for the sake of Zillow shareholders, hopefully they are able to integrate industry best practices.I may hate the label, but I am unquestionably a millennial. Millennials hate phone calls, and as a digital native, there is just a natural proclivity towards using technology. Email and text provide written documentation of everything, while a phone call feels antiquated. 68% of millennials avoid face-to-face conversation, and I can confirm that I know dozens of millennials who frequently exhibit this behavior. This leads to a generation that prefers online shopping to the in-person experience.Zillow grasps this concept. The combination of Zillow Offers, where the company makes an immediate offer on your house and resell it at a later date, the browsing portal, and now mortgage origination could combine to create a powerful one-stop shop for buying a house. I do not think we are quite there yet, but as further generations become accustomed to online portrays of real life consistently become more accurate, I can see a world where you can buy a house from Zillow with almost no interaction.As I mentioned, we are not there yet. Both Zillow and Redfin work with real estate agents, and I believe even millennials enjoy some handholding and the psychological outlet that real estate agents can provide. Both services continue to account for less than 2% of sales nationwide, and we have yet to see evidence of a shift away from human real estate agents. Still, I expect that a shift towards the lower cost services will eventually start to shift marketplace dynamics.In many ways, I clearly see the strategic direction of Zillow, and I understand why it makes sense. Zillow is call point synergy 101 –building adjacent products and services around your captive audience. However, I believe their current strategy is fraught with risk.On the latest conference call, when asked about Zillow Offers, CEO Spencer Rasoff offered this commentary:High volume and low margin scares me in the housing industry. This non-distressed flipping model seems tough for me. In order to get volume and turn the balance sheet over 4x per year, Zillow will need to buy a lot of properties. However, the best time to buy properties at a discount is usually when supply is high, not when it is low. Current marketplace dynamics are marked by low supply and high demand, so sellers have little incentive to sell to Zillow with a lower bid. On the other hand, Zillow could be overwhelmed in a down market when supply greatly outpaces demand, faced with a lot of ideas for capital deployment and weak demand post-purchase.In addition, the pursuit of higher revenue and profits makes execution of this model tricky to navigate. Managers and employees will be incentivized to take more risk if they are able to boost sales, especially since it is being branded as a scale model.Underlying sales growth continues to look solid, as the firm guided to $1.32-1.35 billion, good for growth of roughly 25%. However, profitability is declining, as adjusted EBITDA is likely to be flat to slightly up at $237 to 253 million. The firm also expects to have at least 330 homes in inventory at the end of the year, increasing working capital intensity.Modeling a recurring free cash flow number for this business is very challenging as Zillow changes the business model materially. That being said, I do not model a free cash flow of $500 million for at least four years, meaning the company is trading at well over 20x my 2022 free cash flow number. This seems a bit rich, and even with optimistic revenue growth assumptions; I cannot derive a reasonable DCF value much over $40.I like the bold ambition laid forth by the management team, but I simply believe the new business model is too risky. There is a price I’d be willing to roll the dice on the business model, but that price is 50% lower than today’s current share price. I admire the strategic M&A, but I am happy to stay out of this situation as Zillow transforms its model."
4221747,102795,2018-11-13T12:48:26-05:00,"Last week, Zillow announced its latest financial results, and the stock dropped 25 percent (losing $2 billion in value).But the story everyone is missing is the Zillow Offers iBuying business, and the huge potential of seller leads.Zillow doesn't need to actually buy and sell a lot of houses for this model to generate significant profits for the company in a national rollout.","Last week, Zillow (Z)(ZG) announced its latest financial results, and the stock dropped 25 percent (losing $2 billion in value). But the story everyone is missing is the Zillow Offers iBuying business, and the huge potential of seller leads.Why it matters: Last week I was quoted on MarketWatch saying, “If you’re thinking about Zillow doing iBuying and you’re not thinking about seller leads, you’re thinking about it the wrong way.” Seller leads are the real billion-dollar opportunity.Here's the reason why Zillow's stock tanked 25 percent last week, in one chart:Zillow's premier agent program accounts for over 70 percent of its revenue, or nearly $1 billion. Growth is slowing down. I'm not sure why this surprised anyone on Wall Street; I've been writing about it since early this year (Zillow's revenue growth slows and Zillow's strategic shift to iBuying and mortgages). I believe it's the primary reason Zillow has aggressively expanded into adjacent businesses.Zillow's iBuyer business continues to grow, and the latest results crystallize the opportunity in seller leads.Zillow says that since launch, nearly 20,000 homeowners have taken direct action on its platform to sell their home. Of those, it has purchased just about 1 percent of homes (around 200). That leaves about 19,800 leads who remain interested in selling their homes.If Zillow simply sold those leads at $100 a pop, they're worth nearly $2 million.But the real opportunity is giving those leads to premier agents in exchange for an industry-standard referral fee, about 1 percent, if the property sells (similar to the Opcity business model).Here's the kicker: Zillow claims about 45 percent of consumers that go through the Zillow Offers funnel end up listing their home. That's a high conversion rate reflective of a high intent to sell; about 10 times higher than Opcity's conversion rate.Assuming a 1 percent referral fee, a $250,000 home, and a conversion rate of 45 percent, those 19,800 leads are worth $22 million in revenue to Zillow, almost all profit.Compare that to the estimated profit of its iBuyer business (1.5 percent net profit), which, on 200 houses, is $750,000. The value of the seller leads is worth almost 30 times the profit from flipping houses!Zillow says that based on its current purchase criteria, if Zillow Offers were available in the top 200 metro areas in the U.S., sellers of nearly half of the homes sold in 2017 across the entire nation would have been eligible to receive offers from it to buy their home directly. That equates to around 2.75 million homes annually.Last quarter, Zillow said that it received offer requests from around 15 percent of the total for-sale stock in the Phoenix market. Interestingly, that number increased to 25 percent in September and 35 percent in October. That's a reflection of the strong lead generation power of Zillow Offers across its various web properties.Based on these numbers, if Zillow goes national (200 metro areas) and sees 35 percent of the for-sale stock, it would receive 962,500 offer requests each year.Taking the latest numbers, which have been validated to the tune of 20,000 offer requests over five months in two markets, the total opportunity becomes clear with a national rollout.Seller leads can be a billion-dollar business for Zillow if you believe the current numbers. Even if a national conversion rate is lower, or the % of for-sale stock fluctuates, it's still worth several hundred million dollars in revenue annually.Given the value of the seller leads, should Zillow even be in the business of buying houses? Yes, if it wants a credible product for consumers. The real question is: What proportion of houses should Zillow actually buy?Zillow's ""big picture"" is 5 percent national market share, which equates to buying around 10 percent of all offer requests (it is currently buying around 1 percent of offer requests). At a 1.5 percent net margin, that's around $1 billion in profit.But to reach that scale, Zillow would need to spend $68 billion to purchase 275,000 houses annually. Assuming an average holding time of 90 days, it would need a credit line of $17 billion to fund the effort. Big numbers.A more realistic target would be to only purchase around 1 percent of requests. Nationally, that would be 27,500 homes, which is only around double what Opendoor is currently doing, so it's feasible.In any case, the point is clear: Zillow doesn't need to actually buy and sell a lot of houses for this model to generate significant profits for the company in a national rollout.Zillow is a lead-generation machine, and its recent foray into iBuying is no exception.If you're in the industry and your value proposition to agents is seller lead generation, there's a new game in town. Zillow will be able to generate a massive volume of seller leads with higher intent than almost any other source. If successful, this will have significant implications across the industry."
4175569,20262,2018-05-18T16:42:07-04:00,"Zillow’s Premier Agent advertising program is its prime revenue driver.A pending New York State regulatory review might make Premier Agent a substantially less effective revenue generator.I’d have thought this was sufficiently material to have warranted disclosure to the investment community, but Zillow obviously thinks otherwise.","Note: Much of this is a re-posting of an article that initially appeared on forbes.com, except for a specifically identified section based on additional information.Premier Agent, a program in which real estate agents pay up to have their names, faces and contact information posted alongside listings of other agents, might have changed in a way that could hurt the program and Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) in New York State. There is no official ruling to this effect - yet - but the Department of State has shared with Zillow its intention to do this. If it becomes official and is imitated in other states, it would seriously threaten the extent to which the company can continue to generate anywhere near the level of revenues it's seeing now - unless some of its other ideas can get a heck of a lot of traction and do so very quickly.Sally Seller wants to sell her house. She considers a bunch of agents, some of whom may be friends or relatives, some of who may have been referred by friends or relatives, some of who may have nice offices in the neighborhood, etc. into which Sally can wander. Eventually, she chooses Sal Sale and gives him the exclusive listing.If Sal is lucky, he'll find a buyer on his own, through open houses, advertising in the local papers, word of mouth, potential buyers walking into his office, etc. If that happens, Sal gets to keep a nice commission (5-6%) all by himself.If Sal is less lucky, as is often the case, he'll find a buyer by having posted his listing on an MLS (multiple listing service) to which he belongs. This is a shared system (today we'd call it an intranet or a private members-only internet) in which he shows his listings to other agents and they show him theirs. The benefit of doing this is that Sal gets to quickly and cost-efficiently expose Seller's house to a heck of a bigger pool of prospective purchasers than he could gather on his own. The downside, for Sal, is that if he attracts a buyer that way, there will be another agent involved (since only other agents can see the MLS). In that case, he'll wind up sharing his commission, usually 50-50, with the other agent.As it turned out, MLS is the way most properties in most places get sold, so Sal probably assumes, going in, that he'll make 3% on the sale. That's balanced by the fact that he can also get a lot of other opportunities to make 3% as he scours the MLS on behalf of others who walk into his office looking for help buying houses that are listed by other agents.In our example, Bruce Buyer, who lives in a different part of town, walks into the office of Patricia Purchase and asks for help finding a house in the area in which Sales happens to be selling. Patricia doesn't know Sal but she sees the listing for Sales house on the MLS. Patricia brings Buyer to a showing. Buyer loves the house and makes an offer. Sal discusses it with Seller. After some back-and-forth negotiating, a deal is stuck. When all is said and done, Buyer has a new house, Seller has a lot of money and moves on with her life. Sal and Patricia shake hands as they leave the closing each with a check representing 3% of the sale price and expressing a desire to work with one another again really soon.The open internet is invented, and all sorts of businesses are turned topsy-turvy. Now, Buyer need not look for an agent to help him find a new house. He can just go on zillow.com or any one of a number of rival sites the company swallowed up under our nouvelle views of monopoly and screen for houses the way I screen for stocks. Buyer can even save screens and have alerts emailed or texted to him. The new incarnation of Sal, who posted the listing to Zillow or let his MLS send it there for him, still hopes Buyer will see the online listing, contact him using the information he provides on the site and make the deal himself and keep the whole commission.It looks like Patricia is out of luck since there's no need for Buyer or anyone else to wander into her office looking for help finding a new house. But alas, Zillow is a free-to-user website, and, like all other such websites, it needs to find money somehow if it is to pay its bills and survive. It could sell banner ads and other ads, as do many sites. But as is often the case in the modern internet, these have lost a lot of value as uninterested consumers have become adept at blocking or ignoring them.Zillow found an answer, a program it calls ""Premier Agent."" It's an ad program, but with an interesting twist designed to really shove the ads right into the faces of prospective buyers without them even realizing they're looking at advertisements. When the Buyer clicks to contact the agent for an online listing, then he is unwittingly directed, not to Sal, the listing agent who enabled the listing to get onto Zillow, but to Patricia, who paid to have her name, picture and contact info displayed on Sal's listing. The exact visual presentation has changed a lot (like all those annoying updates you see in your phone apps, Zillow's developers seems to live to update, modify, reimagine, etc. things). But classic Premier Agent was set up to make it highly probable that Buyer would click to contact Patricia rather than Sal. In fact, in some iterations, if Buyer really wanted to get directly to Sal, the listing agent, he'd have to roll up his sleeves, put on his reading glasses and really hunt aggressively and with much determination for the link to Sal that Zillow ""subtly"" (cough, cough) included somewhere on the web page.But at the end of the day, it really isn't so bad. It's not as if Buyer would have likely found his way to Sal anyway. Chances are he'd have gone through Patricia, and Sal and Patricia would have split the commission anyway. Basically, Zillow replaced the brick-and-mortar real estate offices (which still exist but tend to be pretty empty as agents work from their homes and cars via their phones, tablets or laptops).So, Sally Seller is where she would have been in the old days. Bruce Buyer is where he would have been in the old days. Sal Sales is where he would have been in the old days. Patricia Purchase is where she would have been in the old days.The big loser is the principal broker still paying for the physical office that is becoming increasingly less valuable. And the big winner is Zillow which, through Premier Agent, is making money ""renting and administering"" its virtual real estate offices.Harry Hog, Sal's cousin, is a real estate agent in Manhattan, the famous part of New York City with the big buildings. He and other agents who work there hate sharing commissions. So they do not have an MLS. There are some itty-bitty wannabe MLS-like setups (RLS, OLR) heavily used by smaller firms. But the big-shot agents who work for the biggest firms try to go it alone believing their personal brands and/or the brands of their respective firms are all they need. In the old days, they'd do open houses, etc. and advertise in the New York Times or a lower-end paper for lower-end listings. Yeah, there would still be some pesky buyers' agents horning in every now and then. But dual agency (representing and getting paid by both parties to the transaction) was the ideal.Then came a site called streeteasy.com. It was a traditional free-to-consumer site that lived off conventional internet advertising. Manhattan brokers and the public loved it. The listings were very informative, the search capabilities were powerful, the blogs and research were great and there was no Premier Agent, so Harry would be much less likely to have a buyer's agent chiming in and grabbing half his commission. He was so much better off than cousin Sal, who suffered with Zillow and Premier Agent.Everyone in Manhattan lived happily ever after - until Zillow acquired StreetEasy and introduced Premier Agent. No, that explosion you heard was not a rogue state testing nukes. It was the collective cry of anguish of the Manhattan real estate community. (And by the way, I do mean just Manhattan. I'm amazed that nobody at Zillow nor any of the trade journalists who cover real estate in the New York City area realize that the city has four boroughs-counties in addition to Manhattan, which actually have regular Zillow and MLSs and function the way the rest of the country functions.)Skipping the gory details, none of which found their way onto Bravo's reality TV series Million Dollar Listing New York (except for one possibly sponsored scene in which Ryan Serhant discusses use of realtor.com, which is pushing into StreetEasy's territory), here's where things stand today.The New York Department of State, which regulates the local real estate industry (and lots of other licensed professions), is considering changes that could hurt Premier Agent and Zillow consistent with the claim of REBNY (the Real Estate Board of New York, a Manhattan trade group) that allowing other agents (such as Patricia Purchase) to ""advertise"" on the exclusive listing of another agent is illegal. But Zillow isn't actually a real estate agent. Too bad say the regulators, it's on the hook anyway as are all agents who use Premier Agent.The formal rule hasn't yet been issued. Regulators and Zillow are talking and reportedly, Zillow is even talking to REBNY, a scenario that until recently, I'd have pegged as having a much lower probability than a Donald Trump-Kim Jong Un summit (oh, that's also happening - go figure).Here's what Zillow has to hope for:Here's what Zillow (and its shareholders) have to fear:1. Premier Agent dies in Manhattan (and, necessarily, all of New York State since the regulators, unlike the media, know that Manhattan isn't the whole state and require their rules to be followed statewide); and2. Agents and regulators in other states might look at Manhattan, lick their chops, and decide to crowd into their local version of Cafe Regulator to have Zillow-stew for dinner, or3. Premier Agent survives but increased clarity over who the listing agent is reduces the amount for clickthroughs and ultimately commissions that flow to advertisers causing them to abandon the program or slash the prices they're willing to pay thereby causing Zillow to wind up issuing a series of downward estimate revisions that might make brick-and-mortar retail or landline telephony look good.As of this writing, there is no disclosure about this from Zillow, or if there is one, I haven't been able to find it and I've been looking specifically for it. I only know about it because as an attorney in New York, I was able to get a real estate broker license for $155 and I got one. So I'm pretty familiar with the field and what goes on.This story is conspicuous in The Real Deal, the top real estate Trade Publication. I'd have thought that since it calls into question the legality and future of Zillow's biggest source of revenue, it might have been appropriate for the company to have disclosed it to shareholders. Just saying.Here's a Statement from StreetEasy's Senior Manager of Marketing and Communication that was added to the original Forbes article:The author's response to the StreetEasy statement:The following three paragraphs did not appear on Forbes:During a conversation between myself and the StreetEasy spokesperson after publication of the article and before her statement was submitted to Forbes, she was extremely dismissive about the existence of any controversy at all regarding the legality of Premier Agent and insisted that the company's relationship with REBNY and the Manhattan real estate community is harmonious, which I thought was complete baloney based on what I know regarding what's been happening in the real world. And then, after the above statement was added to the Forbes article, I received copies of documents that are before the New York Department of State which directly contradict her verbal assertions to me and cast severe doubt on the viability of the above statement (which, by the way, was submitted by an individual who is not professionally qualified to say that anything is legal or illegal and, as I note below, she declined my request for appropriate contact information with Zillow's corporate attorneys).Whatever the ultimate decision of the New York regulators, it is clear from these documents that there absolutely positively is a substantial controversy before the regulators as to the legality of Premier Agent. It is not my role to make the ultimate judgment on legality or illegality of Premier Agent, although as an attorney (yeah, besides being an investment strategist, I'm that too), I'd put in a heck of a lot more sweat and billable hours trying to argue for Zillow's position than against it.More relevant to an investment community audience, however, I strongly believe Zillow is flat-out wrong to have failed to disclose to disclose to the investment community the existence of this controversy, which, if it goes against Zillow in New York, has the potential to spread and seriously damage the lion's share of Zillow's revenue base. If the assertion of the StreetEasy spokesperson turns out to be less than accurate, well, you know what often happens when estimates and stock prices drop for reasons investors think should have been disclosed.Anyway ... before having received the aforementioned documents, here's what I added to the Forbes article underneath the StreetEasy statement:I softened text contemplating what the New York Department of State might do viz. Premier Agent. I'm OK with the change. I'm not interested in rhetorical hair splitting (unless I put on my legal hat and go into Court, in which I split, split, and split some more). For this venue, let's just get to the substance of this situation.First, in a conversation with the StreetEasy spokesperson, she stated that ""The Real Deal,"" the publication I used a source is not to be believed. I disagree. ""The Real Deal"" is a well-established source in the real estate communities in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami.As to the regulation cited by the StreetEasy spokesperson, it's actually 19 NYCRR Section 175.25. It deals with rules of advertising real estate listings. Specific to this matter, subsection (b)(2)(ii) of 175.25 states as follows:First things first in practice, ""authorization... from the owner"" means a written ""exclusive"" listing agreement. No such writings are required by the reg itself. Listing agreements can be verbal and they need not be exclusive. But for a seller's agent to get a listing onto an MLS, and onto StreetEasy, it has to be written and exclusive. So 175.25(b)(2)(ii) combined with StreetEasy policy (I can verify the latter from personal experience) means no property can be advertised on the site StreetEasy without a written exclusive listing agreement that authorizes the selling agent to do so.Is it possible a Premier Agent (a buyers' agent/advertiser) might somehow or other get his or her hands on an authorization that allows for the Premier Agent to advertise the property? Anything is possible, but that would create a messy situation involving the written exclusives in favor of the listing agent. Also, I have experience with Premier Agent and what Zillow wants from them are credit card numbers, not written authorizations from property sellers.So now, let's see how things actually play out in StreetEasy's Premier Agent.I went to the StreetEasy website and clicked at random on a listing near where I'm sitting; 416 West 52nd Street Apt 616. I look to see how I can contact an agent. By default, I see a big box to the right of the listing inviting me to fill in contact information and click on a huge link with a conspicuous blue background labeled ""SEND MESSAGE."" Below the link is a phone number I can call if I prefer. The number is 646-846-0960. That's the listing agent, right? Given Section 175(b)(2)(ii), coupled with Zillow's generally sensible policy of requiring written exclusive listings, as well as ordinary human common sense, one would think so.That phone number is listed in White Pages Premium as ""No name is associated with this number."" I call it and get a prerecorded message telling me the call may be monitored for quality purposes and then that I'll be connected to ""an agent"" (that's ""an"" agent, not ""the"" agent). It rings through to a voicemail... and then bounces to a second voicemail, and finally, I hear a greeting announcing that I should leave a message for a 718 number. I hang up and refresh the web page. Now, I'm invited to call 917-809-6799. I refresh the page again and this time, I'm invited to call (646) 859-0460. By the way, I tried this routine earlier today and learned, from someone who did pick up such a call, that these are going to Premier Agent advertisers.So what about the listing agent, the one who presumably was authorized under 175(b)(2)(ii) and StreetEasy policy to place the ad, presumably through a written Exclusive Listing? There's another link, very light grey text on a white background, that says ""Seller's Agent Info."" I learn there that the agent is Elena Smirnova of Park River Properties. I click on her name, but get nothing. It's just there, no link. To contact Elena, I have to google her firm, and then hunt for her on the Park River web site. (By the way, if I use the StreetEasy app, it's even harder to find the listing agent's name. Try and see for yourself. But at least on the app, the link does give contacting information for the listing agent -for the hardy folks who can find it.)So, might a rational person looking at StreetEasy Premier Agent, noticing the listings, and noticing how much more likely that it is that an interested party will be directed to an agent who paid for the opportunity to get the communication but has no authority to advertise the listing conclude that this is a violation of 19 NYCRR 175(b)(2)(ii)? Oh, one more thing before you answer. There exists generations of legal precedent in New York and throughout the AngloAmerican legal system that says Courts should consider the ""substance"" of a situation, not just its ""form."" (If the StreetEasy spokesperson would like, I'll be happy to supply an overwhelming number of specific case citations; I just did a quick search on Lexis for and got 3,770 results, for New York alone.)Given all this, was I wrong to wonder about potential legal changes that could hurt Zillow and that should have been disclosed to Zillow shareholders? Check the coverage in ""The Real Deal."" Was I wrong to use it as a credible source as to the existence of a legal controversy, in light of what I showed you here?By the way, I never said Premier Agent can't work. In my opinion, it can if handled, let's say, ""better."" Consider Elena Smirnova, the agent who was being ""made subtle"" in the listing I illustrated above. Actually, I'd seen her name before though I don't know her personally. As I recall, she was once written about in ""The Real Deal"" as a spectacular purchased-lead success story. (I believe she used to work for a firm that bought bulk leads, if not from Premier Agent than from a similar setup, and distributed them to their agents.)But seriously, do you REALLY like the clarity and integrity of the way StreetEasy is presenting this thing? If you were on a jury and were presented with these facts and the judge's instructions on 175(b)(2)(ii) and substance over form, what sort of verdict would you support in a trial charging Premier Agent's with a violation? Or, skip the jury and you be the judge. How do you decide?If you think I'm in the wrong, that no reasonable person could assume the New York Department of State is considering the appropriateness of Premier Agent in light of 175(b)(2)(ii) and that the StreetEasy ""Senior Manager, Marketing and Communications,"" should be taken at her word even though she so far declined to put me in touch with Zillow attorneys as I requested, then you can send me a message and receive a personal one-to-one apology."
4173696,53292,2018-05-14T11:03:42-04:00,"Zillow's new plan to purchase homes provides little impact to the company's bottom line.Zillow's estimates for scale and profitability are not realistic.Even if it could scale, the project would require immense amounts of capital.The project is a distraction from Zillow's growing core business.","The big announcement this quarter from Zillow (Z),(ZG) was that they will be entering the real estate market as a buyer of residential homes.The big concern from investors about Zillow’s latest endeavor is the amount of capital that will be required to implement the project. Here is a quick rundown of Zillow’s estimates for how the program will operate and be financed, based on their most recent earnings call and presentation: What does all of this do to Zillow’s balance sheet?Assuming homes purchased average $250,000 in price and Zillow puts a 30% down payment on each home, Zillow needs $75 million to meet the high end of their goal in 2018. This is a cost that Zillow can easily cover with their $822 million of cash on hand.Zillow also will need cash to prepare the homes for sale. In the latest quarterly earnings call CEO Spencer Rascoff was quick to make the point that Zillow will not be “flipping houses” or doing full remodels:Even an added $10,000 budget per house, which seems high, requires just $10 million from Zillow. That makes the total cost for Zillow to have 1,000 homes on its balance sheet about $85 million, about 10% of its cash balance.Bottom line, I don’t think the capital requirements from this new venture should be a concern initially. Zillow boasts a very strong balance sheet and has the cash available. However, that doesn't mean it's a good idea.If Zillow hits all its targets for this new business segment in 2018, it should bring the company an additional $3,500,000 in income from selling those 1,000 homes. (1,000 homes, with a net income of $3,500 from each home sold, a 1.4% net margin on a $250,000 house).There's some ability for Zillow's plan to scale without requiring massive amounts of capital. Zillow estimates that it will take 90 days to turn over a house.So, if Zillow allocates $85 million to hold 1,000 homes at a time, that money can effectively flip 4,000 homes during the course of a year. If Zillow can turn over a house that quick, and if management's assumptions are realistic, that means $85 million in cash can produce about $14,000,000 in income for Zillow.For a company with a lot of cash on its balance sheet, this seems like a good use of the company's cash, and certainly should provide a better return than the company is getting from its hundreds of millions parked in money market funds.However, I'm doubtful that these numbers are realistic. Zillow's margins are too optimistic and Zillow's new endeavor will not be able to scale much higher to become a significant segment of the business. In the company's most recent prepared remarks, the CEO highlights this new venture as a billion-dollar venture:Zillow's CEO is just using the law of large numbers to make this seem like a viable opportunity. Zillow is dreaming imagining that 5% of all homes will be sold through Zillow’s instant offer, and purchased by Zillow.Besides the fact that this would make Zillow the largest purchaser and owner of homes in America (for reference, Invitation Homes (INVH) owns approximately 100,000 homes and American Homes 4 Rent (AMH) owns approximately 51,000 homes) I don't think this business can scale to anything meaningful.First, as this scales the capital required to be deployed at any one time becomes burdensome. In order to purchase 275,000 homes each year, Zillow would need about $5.83 billion in cash available (assuming a 30% down payment on each home, a $10,000 renovation budget, and that a home can be turned over in 90 days). This will require a lot of additional debt, the interest expenses of which would cut significantly into Zillow's margins. If Zillow could borrow $5 billion at 5%, the interest costs alone would reduce Zillow's margins by 25%.Or the company could issue more shares, but sooner or later shareholders will resist being diluted more than they already have been:Z Shares Outstanding data by YChartsBut more importantly, I don’t think it makes sense in relation to the rest of their business.Ultimately, Zillow would be competing against its own customers.First, other investors using instant offer, such as Invitation Homes (INVH), that are looking to purchase properties to add to their portfolios, would be hurt. Zillow could either keep the best deals on the instant offer platform for themselves, ruining their reputation of providing deals for other investors, or be forced to outbid other investors who can justify higher purchase prices.Would Zillow be able to monetize instant offer if other potential investors know they will only be given deals that Zillow passes on?Zillow has spent a decade building up its reputation and brand to bring hundreds of millions of visitors to its websites. Using Zillow as the platform to connect buyers and sellers, and taking a commission from a buyer like Invitation Homes on instant offer, seems much easier (and not much less profitable?) than taking on the task, and risk, of flipping a house for a 1 or 2 percent margin at best.Second, the margins required for Zillow to produce that net margin of 1% to 2% on a flip requires some desperate sellers.Assume Zillow purchases a home for $250,000. Prior to purchasing, Zillow faces some costs such as loan fees, inspections, legal work, and possibly realtor fees. Then Zillow pays contractors to tidy up the house and prepare it for sale. Finally, Zillow sells the house, once again paying realtor fees and some closing costs.I don’t think it is unreasonable to assume those costs would be around $15,000 for a $250,000 house (3% realtor fees at closing, $5,000 for contractors, $2,500 for other expenses such as legal work, inspections, titling, insurance, loans, other closing costs, etc.)This brings Zillow’s cost to $265,000. Add in a 2% desired net margin and Zillow needs to sell the house that it just purchased a month or two ago for $250,000 for a little over $270,000. I'm not sure there's that much slack in the real estate market to be able to charge 10% more for a home after just a month or two by just applying a new coat of paint.If this can be profitable for Zillow, it will require low-priced offers from Zillow, providing lower commissions for real estate agents than they would get from a traditional sale, again potentially hurting their core business model of attracting real estate agents to the platform. I love Rascoff’s ambition, but ultimately I can’t imagine 5% of all home sellers in the country every year will take $20,000 less on their home for the instant offer conveniences, especially as the average time a home remains on the market shrinks further and further:Source: Zillow DataLike a recent author on Zillow, I'm struggling to understand why Zillow would be attracted to a capital-intensive, low-margin business when it seems to be gaining market share in its much higher margin software and advertising businesses.Source: 2018 Q1 Investor PresentationFor Zillow to scale its new homes segment into anything meaningful, billions of dollars would have to be deployed. That is a scary prospect for a company with a poor history of generating returns on its investments.Z Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YChartsZillow doesn't provide any guidance for the total costs to start this project. But no doubt this will be an excuse to further ramp up SG&A expenses and total debt (and therefore impact that 1 to 2% net margin further):Z SG&A Expense (Annual) data by YChartsI think Zillow has the potential for a very bright future, but this new venture is just a distraction from their solid core business.Zillow has been dominating their market and rapidly becoming a household name for real estate searches. Everyone from realtors to landlords have noticed, and Zillow has been rewarded.The number of agents paying more than $5,000 per month to advertise on Zillow is up 58% over the last year. Income from new rental market products is up 35%. The market share of Zillow's Premier Agents is up 50% since 2016 to 7.5% of all residential real estate transactions. This new venture requires tons of capital, does nothing to improve its market share in any current segments, potentially takes away from its ability to monetize its platform, and adds significant risk to the company's balance sheet."
4200869,102795,2018-08-21T09:35:56-04:00,"The Instant Offer data from Zillow's Q2 financial results was five weeks old. Let's take a look at the most updated data; it's more interesting.
        Zillow is ramping up fast, buying 43 homes in the last five weeks. It's serious.
        Zillow is buying more expensive homes than its competitors and what the market predicted. It's still early days, so let's see if this changes over time.","Zillow's (Z),(ZG) Q2 financial results include some insight into its Instant Offers business and traction to date, but the data is five weeks old. Let's take a look at the most updated data; it's more interesting.All of the data below is for Phoenix, is based on public records, and is accurate as of August 8, 2018.Zillow announced that it bought 19 homes during the second quarter (through June 30). The current total is 62. That's an additional 43 homes purchased in July and the first week of August. A good ramp up.Of those 62 homes, 10 have sold, with the remainder either under contract, for sale, or coming soon.Zillow is purchasing more expensive homes than its iBuyer competitors in Phoenix (Opendoor and Offerpad). The average purchase price for the 62 homes Zillow purchased is $324,000, 25 percent higher than Opendoor.It's worth noting that the median purchase price is materially higher than the estimates being used by analysts and what was suggested in Zillow's Q1 announcement, $257,000.For the iBuyer model to work, the home must be sold for more than its purchase price. I call that price appreciation. As a percentage, the price appreciation on the 10 homes Zillow has sold is 3.3 percent.But because Zillow is purchasing more expensive homes than its competitors, when translated to a dollar value the amount is about equal to Opendoor at $9,600 per home.Keep in mind that this number is not the net profit per transaction. It does notinclude any of the costs associated with buying and selling a home, including agent fees (which are considerable), buyer concessions, finance, holding, and repair costs.The 10 homes Zillow sold moved very quickly. The sample size is small so it shouldn't be used as an assumption for the business at scale.Having said that, of those 10 homes it has taken an average of 20 days to get a contract, and an additional 22 days on average to close. These sales are not indicative of long-term numbers. They are quick sales by definition so they have unusually low times on market.A few takeaways to keep an eye on:You may have noticed the market reacting strongly to Zillow's Q2 announcement, which contained five-week-old data. If you're a serious investor and don't want to live in the past, drop me a line."
4195611,103480,2018-08-07T03:29:50-04:00,"Zillow crashed more than 15% after reporting a miss in Q2 revenues and a light top-line guidance range for Q3.News that Zillow is acquiring a mortgage lender and doubling down on its Zillow Offers strategy is also increasing investors' fear of risk.Still, the company remains one of the largest online real estate assets in the marketplace and trades at decent valuations ,especially after a huge drop.Equally encouraging is an improvement in operating margins and a 41% y/y increase in adjusted EBITDA.","Zillow (Z), the online real estate platform, just can't seem to play the earnings game right. For the second quarter in a row, shares have suffered a huge pullback after reporting results - this time, the ~15% drop was twice as bad as in Q1. Investors have begun to lose patience with Zillow - when will the pain subside? While shares are still up double-digits for the year, the company hasn't budget up since early May.Z data by YChartsOf course, Zillow isn't alone in the Internet sector in losing huge gains since Q2 earnings. Most notably, both Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) suffered large losses after reporting earnings - for the former, the concern was around a slowdown in user growth and disappointing guidance anecdotes for Q3 and Q4, and for the latter, it was a miss in U.S. subscriber counts that got investors worried. Like Zillow, both stocks lost nearly 20% after earnings, yet have made small recoveries since.The primary question for investors now is: will Zillow see a rebound as well? In my view, Zillow is one of the most attractive stocks in the Internet space to invest in. When I take a step back and look at it, the long-term story for Zillow has not changed. When you think about the sites that renters and homebuyers turn to most to do their real estate research, the top sites - Zillow.com, Trulia.com, and StreetEasy (the dominant real estate site in Manhattan) - are all owned by the Zillow Group. And nowadays, basically everyone does house-hunting research online before calling an agent.So in the long run, is Zillow really impacted by one quarter of bad guidance? We'll discuss investors' concerns in the next section, but in my view, this pullback presents a fantastic opportunity to pick up shares of Zillow at a discount.The main landmine that investors stepped over after this quarter's earnings call was a huge miss to Q3 guidance - a far bigger guidance disappointment than basically any other company in the technology sector this quarter. This is also surprising given the company has just launched into a revenue-accretive push into Zillow Offers, which generates a new stream of house-flipping income for Zillow.For Q3, Zillow guided to $337-$347 million in revenues (see table below):Figure 1. Zillow Q3 guidance missSource: Zillow investor relationsZillow generated $281.8 million of revenues in 3Q17 (+26% y/y at the time), so this guidance range now represents a growth range of 20-23% y/y. That's certainly below Wall Street's guidance of $405.1 million (+44% y/y), but not far off from the growth rate that Zillow has posted in Q2 and Q1 (+22% y/y in both quarters).Consensus figures aren't broken down into revenue category, so it's difficult to estimate which pockets of revenue Zillow is missing on. But considering the company just added its new ""Homes"" segment, it would be a safe conjecture to say that it's the Homes segment that Wall Street was expecting more revenues from - especially after the company spent much of last quarter hyping up its ramp of Homes.In my view, we should care less about a revenue shortfall in Homes - which, as you can see above, will contribute a negligible $2-$7 million (1-2%) of Zillow's Q3 revenue base. There are a couple of reasons for this. First of all, the company's Homes business (branded as Zillow Offers to consumers) is a much lower-margin business than its internet services counterpart, and there's even the possibility that Zillow can lose money on flips. Homes also produces negative EBITDA, as shown in the table above. While a quicker ramp on Homes would be preferred, it's not the end of the world to defer those losses until later when the company is better prepared to absorb them.The second source of pessimism is due to Homes itself. Zillow announced it was expanding into two additional markets, Atlanta and Denver, beyond the current launch plan in Phoenix (the first market, debuted in April) and Las Vegas (debuted in June). In addition, Zillow doubled down on its home-buying segment by purchasing a mortgage lender, citing a desire to speed up the mortgage approval process when selling a home purchased via Zillow Offers.Zillow investors have always been wary of Zillow Offers due to the balance sheet risk of carrying homes on inventory, some of which might be sold at a loss or cause the company to enter financial distress should another 2008 happen. I've always argued, however, that Zillow Offers gives the company a chance to diversify its revenue beyond its current fee-for-service business to real estate agents - a market that, as the leading incumbent, is already pretty saturated.In my view, neither a soft Q3 outlook (which seems to be due primarily to a Zillow Offers ramp timing issue) nor an expansion of the Homes segment are real red flags to Zillow's long-term growth story. Zillow is still the dominant online real estate platform, and one that sits on a minefield of critical real estate data - a small bump in the road doesn't change that.Here's a look at the company's Q2 results:Figure 2. Zillow Q2 resultsSource: Zillow investor relationsThe biggest surprise here is that Zillow missed revenue estimates by a hair (it didn't do so great last quarter, either, with in-line results). Revenues grew 21.9% to $325.2 million, barely missing analyst consensus of $325.6 million (+22.1% y/y). Zillow's growth rate, however, stayed roughly flat with last quarter's growth rate of 22.0% y/y, so the shortfall isn't terrible.As noted previously, when we consider the fact that Zillow's core business has been growing at this ~22% y/y rate for the past several quarters, the fact that Wall Street consensus suddenly expected ~40% y/y growth for Q3 implies that the difference must be in Homes - which, as a new addition with uncertain launch timing, does not correlate with a concern about Zillow's core business health. Previously, Zillow had mentioned that Homes wouldn't be revenue-accretive until the ""back half"" of 2018, but now it appears that Zillow meant Q4 whereas analysts might have interpreted that statement to include Q3.I'm also encouraged by a continuation of strong site traffic metrics in Q2, which should be equally as important when evaluating Internet businesses as revenue growth. Total site visits across the Zillow portfolio grew 14% y/y (in-line with last quarter's growth of 15% y/y), and average MAUs of 186 million in the quarter grew 4% y/y, also in-line with 5% y/y growth last quarter.The primary highlight in the quarter, in my opinion, was a boost in margins and a huge narrowing of losses. In particular, Zillow managed relatively flat sales and marketing spend - its largest component of operating costs by a wide mile, which consumed just 45.4% of revenues this quarter, 380bps better than 49.2% in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted EBITDA, Zillow's primary profit metric, grew 41% y/y to $56.0 million and noticed an EBITDA margin of 17.3%, 240bps better than 14.9% in 2Q17 and driven primarily by the efficiencies and sales and marketing spend. Note that this reverses a negative tone din Q1, when EBITDA margins slipped to 15% - with any luck, adjusted EBITDA margins are on the way back up. The company had guided to an adjusted EBITDA range of $49-57 million for this quarter, and ended up achieving the top end of that range.It's also worth noting that, though Wall Street analysts had penciled in a consensus GAAP net loss estimate of -$11.3 million in the quarter, Zillow managed to lose just -$3.1 million in the quarter - shrinking 2Q17's losses by a factor of seven.Zillow's core business is humming along, or at least, it's no worse for wear from Q1. The miss on Q3 guidance seems to be due primarily to a disconnect in Zillow Homes, but given this is a riskier and lower-margin revenue stream, we can afford to hold off on ramping those revenues without sacrificing too much on the bottom line.As usual, the Zillow selloff seems like a gross overreaction. Zillow is a great example of an internet stock that has achieved nearly complete category dominance, and I'm keen to buy on this dip."
4171038,103480,2018-05-08T06:58:42-04:00,"Zillow shares lost 7% after the company posted an in-line quarter.Investors focused on the deterioration of profit metrics, with adjusted EBITDA margins falling to 15% of revenues (from 22% in the prior Q1).The market is still also punishing Zillow for its expansion of Zillow Instant Offers, which can throw unpredictability into Zillow's results and reduce margins.The company's market-leading product, however, is extremely valuable and provides its long-term moat.Though shares are likely to see additional pressure in the near term, Zillow remains a long-term buy.","Similarly to how it's performed over the past several quarters, Zillow (Z) tanked yet again after reporting Q1 earnings. Investors have more or less been treating Zillow like a hot potato: bidding it up quickly for a short stretch of time, then selling off the shares on any hint of negative news. Zillow lost 7% in after-hours trading after the earnings release, essentially reversing all of the gains it made in the prior trading session. In separate news, Zillow also announced the retirement of its CFO, though this seemed to be a planned and gradual exit (she will continue to serve as chief legal officer through 2020) rather than a newsflash to panic about.Though the stock is still up for the year, it's down more than 10% from highs reached in mid-March:Z data by YChartsA quick recall for investors: Zillow shares have been under pressure since last month, when the company announced it would be expanding its Instant Offers program, which essentially buys up houses and flips them later for profit and turns Zillow into a quasi-real estate trader. The company aims to hold between 300-1,000 homes on its balance sheet by year-end, primarily in the Phoenix and Las Vegas areas.Balance sheet risk and unpredictable results are the primary reasons why investors don't like the program - and indeed, we saw some of that this quarter, with adjusted EBITDA margins dipping harshly and net losses widening. But as I've asserted in a prior article, alongside the risk is also room for upside, as Zillow gets another vehicle for revenue stream diversification and growth. Zillow's guidance for FY18 includes an extremely wide revenue range of $125 to $255 million for Zillow Homes, highlighting the uncertainty that investors dislike but also leaving room for massive upside.The other reason Zillow has seen pressure recently is underwhelming guidance, particularly on the profits side. The company hasn't touched its prior guidance range of $1.43-$1.58 billion in revenues (+49% y/y, the bulk of the growth being parked in Instant offers) and adjusted EBITDA of $260-$285 million; the latter was below both Zillow's own original outlook and analyst expectations.I'd argue, however, that while Zillow's margin compression is slightly concerning, it's a mere distraction from Zillow's long-term story. From a big picture standpoint, no company has an internet portfolio as dominant as Zillow's - across its ownership of Trulia, StreetEasy, Hotpads, and several other online real estate platforms, literally no other company is a competitor to Zillow's scale. The uniqueness and dominance of the company's product make Zillow an unshakeable long-term buy. It also wouldn't be completely out of the question for a much larger internet company like Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to want to snap up real estate-focused internet assets.The key message for investors: although there certainly are disappointing elements in Zillow's Q1, the long-term thesis is very much intact. Shares are likely to see pressure in the near term, so I wouldn't buy into Zillow at the very moment, but investors should be prepared to buy on substantial dips.Here's a look at Zillow's Q1 results:Figure 1. Zillow Q1 earningsSource: Zillow investor relationsEven as a Zillow bull, I'll admit that I wish Zillow had done a bit better. Total revenues in the quarter grew 22% y/y to $299.9 million, over the company's initial guidance of $291 to $296 million that had investors scrambling to see the stock at the end of Q4. Still, this result was only in line with consensus expectations, and also showed deceleration from the 24% y/y growth Zillow experienced in Q4. For the full year FY17, Zillow also saw 27% y/y revenue growth.Where Zillow's results were particularly disappointing, at least in my view, were the user statistics. Zillow grew monthly average users (MAUs; arguably the most important metric for any consumer-facing internet company) by just 5% y/y in the quarter to 175 million, while total site visits to all websites in Zillow's portfolio grew 15% y/y to 1.8 billion.Of course, these are still impressive numbers - but no longer puts Zillow in a meaningful growth mode. Last quarter, in which Zillow also got destroyed over poor guidance, the company had at least posted 8% y/y growth in MAUs. A three-point difference at these levels is the difference between night and day. However, I still contend that Zillow has an extremely irreplaceable product at its disposal. What other site can you turn to for house-hunting and rental comparisons? Zillow's sheer market dominance and brand recognition across its portfolio of top-notch names, Trulia included, will drive user growth in the long run.The company isn't expecting any meaningful revenue lift from Instant Offers/Zillow homes until the back half of the year; in its guidance for Q2, the newly-separated Homes segment is still showing a contribution of zero. As Zillow's core Premier Agent revenues begin to taper off into the low 20s and high teens, the availability of Instant Offers revenue (despite how long the margins compared to advertising and agent services) will help to drive some of the upside Zillow is lacking.The profit side is where the story dampens. As you can see in the above chart, Zillow's net losses widened to -$18.6 million in the quarter, down from -$4.6 million in 1Q17 (though surprisingly, pro forma EPS of $0.07 came in a penny above consensus estimates of $0.06).The major focus, however, is on adjusted EBITDA - which saw a 15% y/y contraction to $46.3 million in the quarter. This also represents a 15% EBITDA margin, down sharply from 22% in 1Q17. The primary cause is a 30% y/y rise in sales and marketing costs to $137.3 million - a much faster rate of expense growth than the revenue growth it was able to accomplish. And though it's a smaller proportion of revenues than sales and marketing, technology development costs also rose faster than revenues (29% y/y) to $93.9 million, eating further into Zillow's operating margin.The problem is likely to exacerbate in Q2. The company's Instant Offers product is expected to bring in no incremental revenue, but incur between -$8 million to -$5 million in negative adj. EBITDA. This will put further pressure on Zillow's EBITDA margin - the company is guiding to $49 to $57 million of EBITDA in the quarter, including the headwinds from Zillow Homes, which implies a 16% margin on revenues of $322 to $327 million. This is slightly better than this quarter's margin, but seasonally Zillow should be performing much better in Q2 than in Q1 to begin with.So Zillow had a somewhat mixed quarter, but there's no reason to panic. The company is undergoing a few growing pains as it adds a major new business line and sees some deceleration in its core Premier Agent revenues, while at the same time dealing with a national tight real estate market due to limited supply growth and rising interest rates.These issues, however, are temporary ones. I believe Zillow's product and value proposition affords it an extremely long lifetime of growth opportunities, and the bullish thesis remains very much intact. In the near term, Zillow shares are a hold as the markets continue to digest Zillow's news, but any signs of a dip to the mid/high $40s should be bought."
4163604,22148,2018-04-17T19:50:38-04:00,Zillow enters the home investment market via Instant Offers.The online real estate company cut EBITDA targets for the year following weak guidance in February.The market shift to the iBuyer model places pressure on the Premier Agent business model that's driving ad growth.,"Zillow Group (Z, ZG) plunged following the decision to move forward with Instant Offers that expands the business beyond just an advertising model. The additional risk is being overplayed, but the upside from the venture appears limited.Source: Zillow websiteOne of the biggest issues with the merger with Trulia a few years back was the shrinking of the growth rate as Zillow acquired future growth vs. taking market share in the home rental market. The stock is down about $10 from the recent highs as revenue was set to dip to historically low rates below 20%.ZG Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsThe latest plan to more aggressively pursue Instant Offers helps expand the total addressable market opportunity. Instant Offers was originally offered starting in May 2017 in Orlando and Las Vegas with home owners submitting data to Zillow and instantly obtaining offers from investors to purchase those homes. Based on that experience, Zillow is entering the marketplace as an investor in Las Vegas and expanding the marketplace to include Phoenix.Source: Zillow investor presentationThe biggest issue is whether the company is moving into new opportunities similar to how Square (SQ) has expanded the business or completely changing the business model. Square expanded into Square Capital, Square Cash and other associated business lines that expanded the reach of the fintech. The company went from transactions to recurring revenue streams that mostly involved financial transactions. Zillow is going from an advertising model to real estate investments that completely alter the business model.Zillow is hoping to facilitate transactions in the real estate sector, but the program comes at a huge cost with no guarantee of a profit. The company suggested the TAM expands to $1.8 trillion, but the key figure is the profit margin and not the transaction values.Worse yet, the company spends entirely too much time discussing these investments as a business and not a tool to facilitate a real estate market lacking in liquidity.Back along with the Q4'17 earnings report on February 8, Zillow forecast EBITDA of $307.5 million. The company suggests that about $20 million of expenses to support the original testing of Instant Offers were included in that target, but the Q1 and full-year targets were lower than expectations.The new update forecasts a big hit to EBITDA to the tune of another $35 million. The new forecast highlights the issue with the Homes business. Revenues are surging to $1.5 billion providing $200 million in additional revenues, but profits are down substantially as flipping houses in scale is costly.Source: Zillow preliminary Q1'18 presentation Zillow has about $763 million on the balance sheet, so the risk of up to 1,000 homes in the flipping process isn't a risk to the long-term story. Even an investment loss of $10,000 per home only amounts to a $10 million hit, so financial risk isn't a big problem.The bigger issue is scaling up the business for the investments vs. building out the platform for real estate agents and investors to stay on the platform. The bigger concern being that the existing business model is under assault by Opendoor and other players in the sector. If the on-demand homebuyers grow market share, the Premier Agents will have less business and reasons to use Zillow as a lead generation platform. According to this Forbes article last October, Opendoor topped $1 billion in annual home purchase volume, reaching 3% of market share in some markets. The company has clearly increased share for Zillow to enter the market.At a market cap of $10 billion, Zillow isn't much of a bargain with EBITDA forecast at $272.5 million for 2018 and the business model under assault.The key investor takeaway is that the move into the home buying sector appears more defensive than a great business opportunity. The story would be more interesting if Zillow wasn't taking such an EBITDA hit to expand this test marketplace offering. For this reason, the stock isn't an instant bargain and we're on the sidelines for this test."
4172852,86896,2018-05-11T11:14:46-04:00,"Zillow's first quarter results are a mixed bag of good and bad.The principal question on everyone's mind is will the real estate tech firm ever show us profit?With competition, higher interest rates, and a somewhat unfamiliar plan to buy/sell homes, Zillow seems pretty expensive.","Zillow (Z) is an enigma to me. For the most part, I dislike the pervasive nature of West Coast tech companies. They wish to replace labor intensive businesses, rather than complement them. Zillow is different. Its model is useful to the real estate industry as a whole. Real estate agencies and brokers can use it as a tool to complement their own business. In fact, the majority of the company's revenue comes from agents. I like that, and have been intrigued by the company's growth.What I don't like is the company's apparent total inability, or lack of interest, in managing its expenses. The firm's revenue stream has increased to over $1 billion annually. But the company still isn't turning profits. The company reported its first quarter results yesterday. The results were a continuation of revenue growth combined with incessant losses. It seems to be the hip thing these days. Tech companies are following a weird trend of creating huge sales gains, with almost inherent losses.Losses can be forgiven if the future will more than make up for it, but at the current stock price, Zillow simply costs too much. The future profits are already stacked into this one. Who wants to pay $54 a share for a stock with zero earnings? Also, I fear the company is being given too much credit regarding its place within the real estate industry. It is not a unique platform. There are competitors working to capture the exact same market space. It could very well end up diluting the total slice of the pie for Zillow.After reaching $1 billion marker last in year in revenues, Zillow has taken things even further in the first quarter, with 22% increase in revenues (year over year) to just under $300 million. The majority of that revenue comes from their premier agent accounts, with over $213 million in total revenues from that category. By far the most important aspect of Zillow's business, premier agent revenue increased by 22% year over year, as the number of agents spending more than $5,000/month on Zillow grew by a whopping 58%.Make no mistake. There are encouraging metrics. Visits among Zillow's various sites increased 15% year over year. Sales growth for customers that have been Zillow members for more than a year's time increased 38% year over year. That's a good indicator of the growth potential past simply increasing the total number of agents involved.The pesky problem with Zillow thus far is simple. They don't make any money. In fact, they lost more money in the first quarter than they did last year. Negative net income of $18.59 million is more than four times last year's loss of $4.6 million. That's a loss of $0.10 per diluted share. Why should shareholders pay a big premium for that? It's a habit common among tech stocks that I simply will never understand. Tesla Motors (TSLA) is more tech than car. It loses big sums of money, faces competitors in the arguably the most cut throat industry in the world, and STILL somehow trades near $300 a share. It's absurd.These types of stocks need to be kept within sane levels or there's no merit for shareholders.There's one reason that I'm perplexed by Zillow's new plan to buy and sell houses. The estimated margins are slim. Zillow's current business involves pretty high margins, and they still can't turn profits. So why are to expect pouring money into a low margin business, that the company has never done before, to be a good idea?Past that, the logistical operations of buying and flipping homes is much more complicated than their current advertising platform. They'll need contractors and large scale financing to do it. That involves more debt; something the company is getting a little too comfortable with for my liking.As of the first quarter, Zillow had long term debt of $389 million. You end up taking on debt when you don't produce income. It's that simple. If they're going to invest in the buy/sell of homes, I expect that debt level to increase by millions more as they finance their initiatives. The company is also creating most of its cash flow through financing. The sale of stock is diluting shareholders positions, making that $54 price tag even less appealing.Overall Zillow presents a real dilemma to me in terms of investment. The idea is great. And it definitely increases consumer exposure to a wider range of properties. But I'm confused by the drawn out route to profitability. Surely expenses could have been curtailed enough by this point to showcase a little value for shareholders. It's important to note that the company's business model is not unique, and can totally be replicated. Redfin (RDFN) is doing just that.Though smaller, Redfin's business model is pretty darn similar. They also have been plagued by negative net income. Both stocks trade at overpriced levels relative to their actual businesses. Why can't RE/MAX (RMAX) make their own site similar to Zillow? Why can't Keller Williams? The answer is they can. They could also block their brokerages from allowing their listings on Zillow. This further demonstrates my qualm with the digital real estate industry. All of the major players could quite easily disrupt the market for one another.Another company, eXp World Holdings (EXPI) is making waves within the digital real estate realm. Though small, the cloud based and agent owned company is experiencing large scale revenue growth. Like Zillow and Redfin, it is headquartered out of Washington State, and seems intent on shaking things up. Either way, Zillow sits in a very competitive marketplace. There are multiple players vying for position, as well as the old cohort like Keller Williams and RE/MAX that won't simply give up their positions within the real estate industry. I think Zillow should focus on profits while there are profits to be made.My last thought that I'll throw out on Zillow and the real estate business in general is the effects of rising interest rates. If rates continue to rise, home buying could slow down. It's a natural progression from having to pay higher yields on your loans. I know. I'm rattling off econ 101 right? But hey it's the simple concepts that have the greatest effect. In the utterly reactionary markets that we live in these days, higher mortgage rates will curtail home buying. That could slow Zillow, and everyone else's traffic.In summary, Zillow is pretty expensive when you consider everything it still needs to overcome. If we were getting $1/share in earnings, the stock would make total sense. But right now all you're getting is higher losses and rising debt. While I think the company can obviously create a viable business with its big revenue growth, downgrades and overreaching are hampering the appeal of the stock price at this time.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4163007,103480,2018-04-14T06:11:11-04:00,"Zillow has endured a nasty selloff after announcing that it would expand its Instant Offers program, which engages home flipping on the company's own principal, into Phoenix and Las Vegas.The company is expected to purchase between 300-1,000 homes this year.These are relatively low-cost markets, with the median home costing between $200-$300k. Even buying 1,000 of these homes wouldn't consume half of the $760 million on Zillow's balance sheet.The so-called ""balance sheet risk"" that naysayers are citing are minimal, and there is also potential for upside.The company remains cheap at ~5x forward revenues, especially after releasing preliminary Q1 results that beat consensus by a wide margin.","The fact that investors are risk-intolerant has long been a central tenet of investing. The new and the unknown are not welcome on Wall Street - investors would much rather prefer that their companies produce a consistent stream of quarterly beats, with minimal disruptions and as few strategy changes as possible.Zillow (Z), the premier online real estate data site, shook up the markets when it announced it would be dramatically expanding its Instant Offers program.A quick primer for the unfamiliar - Instant Offers in itself is not exactly new. Zillow has been experimenting with principal real estate transactions since 2017, according to its 10-K, though until now such activities had been very limited in scope. Using the company's proprietary data, Zillow can opt to make a spot offer on a seller's home and purchase it from them in a quick transaction. Zillow also secures a real estate agent for the seller, eliminating the notion that Zillow is effectively competing with its largest customer base (the majority of Zillow's revenues are derived from the fees that real estate agents pay to be featured on Zillow sites next to home listings).Analyst downgrades have come out on the basis of risk in an expanded Instant Offers program, but I find this argument to be a bit inconclusive. True, principal transactions involve risk, but this move also gives Zillow access to a completely new and diversified revenue stream. The company will also own a large portfolio of homes, shielding it from concentrated loss unless the 2008 real estate meltdown repeats itself (unlikely); and in any case, the homes are meant to be fix-and-flips, so they won't bog down the balance sheet for very long.The downside is at least neutrally balanced against the upside, and shares didn't deserve a near-10% selloff. Zillow has made an astounding recovery from near-term lows after posting disappointing guidance along with its Q4 earnings in February, but this pullback offers a chance for new investors to ride the recovery of a data-rich, market-leading Internet stock.Z data by YChartsWith a current market cap of $6.93 billion after the selloff, and taking into account the $762.5 million of cash and $385.4 million of debt on Zillow's balance sheet, the company carries an enterprise value of $6.55 billion. Against Zillow's refreshed guidance of $1.43-$1.58 billion in revenues, that's an EV/FY18 revenue multiple of 4.35x - a downright steal for a company growing at 27% y/y and posting gross margins in the 90s. I'm long with a price target of $68, representing 6x EV/FY18 revenues and 36% upside from current levels.Note that Zillow's previous revenue guidance had been $1.302-$1.317 billion for FY18 - if we treat the incremental $196 million in guidance as due exclusively to Instant Offers, and exclude it from our valuation because it's a lower-margin revenue stream, we still arrive at a price target of $60 (20% upside) based on 6x EV/FY18 revenues on purely its non-Instant Offer revenue stream. That's plenty of room for error for investors to go long.As we just noted, Zillow's FY18 guidance range effectively implies a nearly ~$200 million lift from Instant Offers. Based on Zillow's FY17 revenue of $1.08 billion, that's about 19 points of top-line growth attributed to this business alone. That's serious upside - and it seems almost that the upside narrative got entirely crushed and forgotten by risk worries.Of course, we have to treat this revenue stream as ""less valuable"" than Zillow's core advertising and fee-based revenues. The reasons are simple: one, it's more unpredictable than Zillow's flagship business, and two, it's a lower-margin business model. A slide below, taken from an investor presentation Zillow posted to the SEC website, details how the accounting will work for Instant Offers:Figure 1. Zillow Instant Offers accountingSource: SECDue to the low-margin nature of this business, when valuing Zillow from a revenue standpoint, we can either exclude this revenue stream or assign a lower valuation multiple to it. For conservatism, I've applied the former.Note another salient point on this slide: Zillow is assuming it will be holding these homes for 90 days or less. These short-term holding periods and fast flips aren't likely to cause huge systemic risks in Zillow's balance sheet, as some Wall Street analysts are saying.One more fact that minimizes the potential risk of Zillow's Instant Offers expansion: the company is particularly targeting single-family homes in Pheonix, Arizona and Las Vegas, Nevada - two particularly low-cost markets where the practice of flipping is established, especially in the latter.According to Zillow's own data (the premise, after all, is that Zillow's proprietary home valuation technologies will allow it to earn a premium on its real estate investments), homes in Phoenix have a median price of $227,300 and homes in Las Vegas have a median price of $247,700.Zillow has explicitly guided (also in the slide deck) that it will be holding between 300-1,000 such homes on its balance sheet by year-end. Let's say it has 500 median-priced homes in each market - that's a portfolio of $111.7 million in Phoenix and $123.9 million in Las Vegas, or $235.6 million overall. That's less than one-third of the cash and short-term investments on Zillow's most recent balance sheet, as shown below:Figure 2. Zillow 4Q17 balance sheetSource: Zillow investor relationsThese principal investments are akin to a large company investing its cash into debt or equity securities as part of a treasury management strategy, as many companies are known to do - cash, after all, yields next to nothing. Arguably, due to Zillow's own expertise in the real estate domain, these investments are far less haphazard than typical treasury investments.This line of argument isn't to say that Instant Offers bears no risk - in business, almost nothing is a risk-free proposition. However, in proportion to Zillow's scale and skill in real estate, the concerns are far overblown.Let's also consider the fact that alongside Zillow's Instant Offers announcement, it also released some fresh new guidance figures ahead of Q1 earnings, expected some time in May.Now, the full-year FY18 guidance is a bit mixed. The company raised its revenue guidance to $1.43 to $1.58 billion as previously discussed (+49% y/y at the midpoint, an increase of $196 million from the prior guidance of $1.302-$1.317 billion, presumably due to Instant Offers). However, it dropped its EBITDA view from $300-$315 million to $260-$285 million. Again, this is likely due to the unknown impacts of Instant Offers - the returns on home-flipping can vary widely or even have a negative impact on the business in the first year of the expansion. All in all, however, we have to weigh the possible upside alongside the risk.Note that Zillow's entry into principal transactions also greatly increases its TAM - putting it in a similar business to startups like OpenDoor as well as private equity funds like Blackstone (BX), which, through its Invitation Homes (INVH) holding, snapped up hundreds of thousands of single-family homes last year.Zillow's new opportunity gives it access to a much wider TAM as illustrated in its slide below, at just the right time when its growth is beginning to see deceleration:Figure 3. Zillow's expanded TAMSource: SECAside from the mixed FY18 guidance, Zillow also released preliminary results for the first quarter ending in March. The company is expecting to report $299-$301 million in revenues (above consensus of $295 million) and $45-$47 million of EBITDA (above its own guidance of $42-$47 million).With a Q1 beat virtually assured, there's almost no reason not to take advantage of Zillow shares while they're low.The key sound bite for investors: Stay long on Zillow and give it the benefit of the doubt as we wait for a ~$60-plus price target - the opportunity for upside in Instant Offers is much more appealing than the risk it entails, and even if some of these principal investments go sour, Zillow is only putting at risk less than one-third of the cash on its balance sheet."

In its recent quarter, gains in its consumer audience and engagement drove revenue outperformance, flowing through to profitability, according to management.In years past, most people visited its website out of curiosity to see the Zestimate for their or maybe their neighbor's home. Zillow's brands have evolved to become a resource for consumers during the home shopping process. Nearly four out of five buyers are shopping for their home online, according to company reports. Many of them expect more seamless services down the funnel toward the transaction.Zillow is evolving toward being a deeper funnel real estate industry partner. The company's new mobile-friendly site provides buyers and renters with town guides and expansive for sale, for rent and land listings. Its Premier Agent business helps connect home shoppers from its mobile apps and websites with actual real estate agents, and helps agents improve their conversion and profitability. Its Dotloop platform provides real estate professionals with software to complete paperless transactions, spending less time on administrative tasks and more time with clients.Additionally, with its new My Agent feature, agents and clients are given a better platform for beginning a conversation. After being connected through Concierge, Zillow enables agents to have an exclusive relationship with consumers on Zillow or Trulia. Once My Agent is activated, when the buyer returns to Zillow or Trulia, the consumer only sees their agent.The typical buyer comes back to Zillow's apps or websites almost 30 times over the course of the month following that initial contact, according to management. The exclusivity of the My Agent connection ensures that the consumer communicates only with their agent every time they come back, significantly strengthening that relationship. This more frictionless experience for consumers aids in accomplishing the home transaction, while eliminating the superfluous aspects of shopping for a home.Zillow is also gathering consumer satisfaction data on Premier Agents and Brokers, which will help the company match consumers with the best agents going forward. Another new product that helps Zillow get deeper down the funnel with home sellers and agents is Instant Offers. The early adoption of this product identified a subset of motivated sellers who value speed and certainty of a sale over price, with many consumers who were testing the waters but want to sell their home in a traditional way.As is seen, Zillow is using quantitative metrics to better define the home shopping environment. By creating markets for specific buyers and sellers, transactions occur more seamless. This easy flow of transaction is not commonly associated with buying a home, much like finding a date is more difficult in a new area without the online capabilities of a dating app. Zillow is innovating and reinvesting in the online home buying experience, which looks to be paying off.Below is a chart of Zillow's revenue, price per share, and earnings per share. Although demand for Zillow's products has been strong since its inception, the company has only really operated at a profit in recent quarters.

We compare its key metrics to global peers.While it leads in terms of revenue and yearly growth, it lags considerably in profitability.A data-driven analysis reveals key insights as part of a larger report.","I recently released my Global Real Estate Portal Report for 2017, a 100+ slide, evidence-based presentation looking at the top real estate portals from around the globe. It gives an illuminating view of best practices, emerging trends, growth strategies, and common insights and challenges.Of particular interest for this audience is the detailed look at Zillow Group (NASDAQ:Z) (NASDAQ:ZG).To begin with, Zillow is the largest real estate portal in the world in terms of revenue, as shown by the chart below.And its yearly revenue growth is very strong, especially compared to peers in mature markets.But profitability lags far behind global peers, as the continued investment and cost of business in the U.S. grows each year.In terms of organizational efficiency, the revenue per employee is near the lower end of the spectrum globally.Zillow has always spent more than it makes. It’s an expensive business to operate.Expenses came in line with revenues for three quarters, but are back up in Q2 2017.When it talks about EBITDA, Zillow is using an adjusted figure that doesn’t paint an accurate picture of the business. I have adjusted it as follows to arrive at an apples-to-apples comparison.And because of the low profit margin, its enterprise value is out of line compared to global peers.The big question: how big can Zillow become? Looking at macro numbers, it’s right in line with global peers in terms of revenue per capita.The full report, which contains much more information on both Zillow and a variety of global peers, can be seen below:"
4109130,86896,2017-09-25T07:12:10-04:00,"Zillow Group has been getting a little attention as expenses and revenues finally start to edge toward a balance.The third-quarter outlook involves positive net income. That said, the figures don't seem to justify the stock price.The company has competitors forming through normal brokerages, and other players like Apartments.com. It does not make sense to me to pay anywhere near $40 a share for this stock.","Something that drives me nuts about Zillow Group (NASDAQ:Z) is how long it is taking for it to produce meaningful profits. You have a stock that until the recent drama over home valuation lawsuits was trading at over $50 a share. Ironically, the company has reported consistent losses. The second quarter of 2017 showed signs of expenses finally nearing a balance with revenues. Will it all change in the third quarter? If so, will it be enough to justify the stock’s valuation? I have concerns. For one, its business model is easily replicated. The company has created over $300 million of debt, and the stock is expensive.Ignoring this year’s drama over lawsuits, Zillow’s moves have shaken the real estate world. On top of that, its revenue growth has been impressive. Between 2012 and 2016, revenues have increased more than 800% to $846.59 million. That said, it just hasn’t proven super profitable. In that same time frame, the company lost around $400 million. Shares outstanding have subsequently skyrocketed to 185.44 million in order to raise capital. That’s roughly 6x the number in 2012. The company reported $6.81 million in earnings last September, and hasn’t delivered positive numbers since.Q2’17 was a big improvement. Not only did Zillow’s revenues improve by 28% year over year, but also its net loss drastically improved to $21.8 million versus $156.1 million in 2016. Alas, despite a record $266.9 million in business, Zillow Group found no profits. The cause is an aptitude for increasing costs. While the cost of goods sold actually decreased for the quarter, Zillow’s SG&A expenses expanded 19.37% quarter to quarter. That’s about double the rate of the company’s actual sales growth.Again, I would point out that year over year the numbers are still a drastic improvement. SG&A expenses decreased 35% to $239.95 million. So if I was to simplify my take on this whole story, Zillow has drastically improved its big picture finances, but there are still some tweaks that need to be made.I myself still feel the stock is a bit overpriced considering the lack of real earnings backing it up. As I said before, SG&A expenses are still outgrowing revenues on a percentage rate basis. If Zillow turns a profit this quarter, I doubt it’s going to create a price to earnings ratio justifying $40. Barring a severely blunt end to what has been a very long bull market (that’s right, it could very well happen), I expect Zillow’s third-quarter results will have a significant impact on which direction the stock carries throughout the rest of the year. This is all about morale. Investors have waited quite a few years to see some significant returns on investment.All they’ve actually gotten thus far is a severe dilution of their stock. In turn it has diminished their cut of the much anticipated earnings. Couple in the bearish weight from lawsuit talk over insulting housing valuations and Zillow really needs a win. Personally, I think the only thing that has held the stock up was its surprising second quarter. The record-setting quarter that outperformed many estimates has provided hope of a profitable third act for the year. The exponential revenue growth is an encouraging sign. Zillow Group’s own outlook has net income for the third quarter ranging broadly between $2.25 million and $7.25 million. God be with it if it comes up in the red again after tugging at our heart strings.Like most things, real estate is certainly merging with online business. To that end, I think Zillow has a bright future. When you consider the sheer increases in revenue, it’s clear there’s a good business here. That said, I’m not sure now is the time to take the plunge. The stock is expensive. Even if the company hits on the higher end of that net income projection, $7.5 million doesn’t deliver much in terms of earnings per share when the company is projecting diluted shares between 196 million and 198 million. $0.03 per share does not justify a $40 price tag. Furthermore, the full-year outlook is still in red territory with 2017 net income projections at a loss of $25-15 million.If you couple in the very high nature of the stock market right now, I think Zillow has room to fall. Let’s be honest, many of these mainly online-based tech companies have very elevated valuations relative to their actual earnings performance. If this bull market does break, and we finally experience some widespread downside, I see these types of stocks as being the first to fall.From a less dramatic viewpoint, Zillow’s stock has been bearish for the past three months. A profitable third quarter might bolster prices in a reactive manner, but the projected earnings aren’t enough to justify current prices. I will consider taking a long-term position in Zillow Group around $20-25 a share. It doesn’t make sense to pay $40 for a company that will still be in the red for 2017. Furthermore, its model is easily replicated.There are hundreds of real estate brokerages out there that probably don’t like seeing commissions being spread into paying for Zillow advertising. Who’s to say that more won’t follow the Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN) approach and start pushing their brokerage work online? Keller Williams certainly has the scale and capacity to do it. CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) is already doing it with Apartments.com as well as other ventures. CoStar is also priced very high, but it is at least putting up profits.Overall, I like Zillow’s business. I just want to see a little cost management moving forward in order to justify the stock price."
4133318,102795,2017-12-21T14:07:42-05:00,"Facebook’s deeper move into real estate — both in rentals and for sale listings — represents a strategic threat to a range of existing businesses.For real estate portals, the first battleground is agent premium spend. Facebook is giving agents a new, powerful choice of where to spend their money for leads.In the near term, real estate portals need to take action to cement their position as the best place to advertise properties for sale and for agents to generate leads.","Facebook (FB) has always played a supporting role in the marketing portfolio of real estate professionals: historically, agents have been twice as likely to advertise on a listing portal than on social media. For its part, Facebook has never built features that cater directly to real estate consumers and professionals. Earlier this year, that changed—signaling a shift in strategy with major implications for real estate portals.A month ago, Facebook announced a major update to the “Property Rentals” section on Facebook Marketplace, launching a new front-end that allows mobile users to search for rentals using a variety of new filters: rental type, location, number of bedrooms, pet friendliness and more.Facebook Marketplace’s Property RentalsPaired with this product update are new partnerships with Zumper and Apartment List—two of the most prominent online rental platforms, which collectively receive millions of unique visitors a month—which will directly syndicate “hundreds of thousands” of rental listings to Facebook.This is the second major step that Facebook has taken into residential real estate in three months. September saw the launch of Dynamic Ads for Real Estate, which lets brokerages and real estate websites promote live listings to Facebook users.What do these features reveal about Facebook’s real estate strategy, and what does Facebook’s growing interest in real estate mean for portals? In this article, we’ll take a closer look at Facebook’s recent moves into residential real estate, assess its motivations and forward-looking roadmap, and discuss the implications for existing players, especially real estate portals.Facebook cemented its status as an important marketing channel for rental managers and real estate agents well before the launch of Property Rentals and Dynamic Ads. On the rental front, Facebook has long hosted groups like Gypsy Housing, home to local classified posts from individuals and small-time landlords renting their property and rental seekers seeking the perfect match. Individual landlords have been able to post listings to Facebook Marketplace since the product’s launch last fall.But rudimentary search and lack of quality inventory has stopped rentals from really taking off on Marketplace. Though we don’t have precise data from Facebook, this qualitative observation is reinforced by the continued growth of informal housing groups.On the sale front, real estate agents have used Facebook to build local awareness of their services or conduct targeted promotion of their listings, taking advantage of relatively slim competition to generate strong ROI. When Inman News surveyed agents on their use of Facebook this past September, one agent noted that she once spent $750 on a listing ad that generated six contracts and “hundreds” of leads.Another agent reports that his average cost per lead from Facebook is around $5, comparing favorably to an average of $100 per lead from Zillow (Z)(ZG)—although that cost per lead has jumped sixfold over the past three years as more agents bid for ad inventory. In general, Facebook has delivered high ROI to agents, but only for those willing to manually upload listings, optimize ad creative and nurture leads over a longer time horizon. Even without the benefit of any features specific to real estate, Facebook has already captured substantial mindshare among agents, with a September 2017 report by research firm Borrell Associates suggesting that agents are “more likely to buy ads on social media than all other forms of digital media, including listing portals.”The revamped Property Rentals section and Dynamic Ads for Real Estate seem like simple optimizations at first blush, but their impact will be substantial.On the rental front, the product refresh and accompanying listing partnerships are game changers. Syndicating listings from established rental sites—and improving the user experience for renters—will make rental search far more useful on Facebook, attracting users who will ultimately incentivize more landlords to post inventory directly to Facebook.Facebook isn’t settling for feature parity with powerful incumbents like Craigslist, encouraging landlords to post 360° photos to provide a better sense for what a listing is like.Facebook is smart to focus on rentals, which are an ideal entry point into residential real estate because competition is fragmented: there is no MLS or single source of truth for rental inventory. By supercharging its network effect through listing syndication and user-side tweaks, Facebook has a shot at replacing Craigslist as the most comprehensive database of rental listings in America.On the sale side, the launch of Dynamic Ads for Real Estate makes Facebook a far more powerful tool for real estate agents.Facebook’s Dynamic Ads for Real Estate productUntil now, agents could only target broad audiences, capturing leads with less intent than users actively surfing a real estate portal for homes. By allowing brokerages to upload a catalog of live listings and target users based on their past interaction with specific listings, Facebook lets agents market to users who directly demonstrate affinity for their homes for sale, which should improve lead quality and ROI.What do these new features have in common? Both incentivize suppliers of real estate inventory—property managers and landlords on the rental side, agents and brokers on the sale side—to upload more listings to Facebook.The fundamental competency of an advertising platform is surfacing the right product or service (in our case, inventory) to the right consumer at the right time (in our case, transactional intent): in other words, identifying a consumer’s need and offering a relevant solution. With more than two billion users between its various products, Facebook is one of the few platforms that already has the right consumer in its grasp—and its real estate strategy targets the other pieces of the equation.Listing inventory is the bedrock of Facebook’s strategy to capture market share in real estate ad spend. Even if Facebook had perfect knowledge of a consumer’s intent to rent or buy a home, it can only monetize that intent if it has a “product”—a listing—to display.Accumulating a greater volume and variety of real estate inventory has another major benefit: by giving consumers more opportunities to interact with real estate, Facebook learns more about their preferences and intent, which enables more effective targeting. For example, Dynamic Ads for Real Estate already helps agents automatically target consumers who have visited their websites and browsed their listings. But a strong rental platform allows Facebook to add another powerful targeting tool to the mix, letting them advertise to folks searching for rentals with demographic characteristics that also make them likely buyers.The more precise targeting options available to agents, the stronger a case Facebook can make to brokers that they should syndicate listings directly to Facebook. This is when things get interesting: if enough agents use Facebook real estate ads in a given market, we can even imagine progressive MLS boards—who have been eager for more leverage against the portals—syndicating listings directly to Facebook.This presents the billion dollar question: will Facebook attempt to compete directly with real estate portals? We don’t believe Facebook wants to launch map-based real estate search, or turn the Marketplace into a fee-generating product for rental and sale listings. In the short run, Facebook is laser focused on improving its advertising product for real estate professionals and capturing a higher proportion of ad spend from portals.Things could get worse for portals in the long run. We discuss this in greater detail below, but as Facebook accumulates more inventory and learns how to precisely mate those listings to consumer needs, it may be able to leapfrog map-based search entirely by using natural language queries from the homebuyer and precise algorithms to match users with the perfect home for them.This won’t happen for years, but inventory would make it possible—and as we’ll discuss below, cultivating and protecting proprietary inventory is one way that portals can fight back.The primary impact of Facebook’s move, in the short- to medium-term, will be increased competition for premium ad dollars from real estate agents. In the U.S., 70 percent of Zillow’s revenue comes from real estate agents, and the trend extends to each major international market.Facebook’s entry into real estate advertising represents clear and direct competition for this premium spend. Real estate agents will have another top-tier platform to spend money on to generate additional branding for themselves, generate leads, or promote the homes they are selling. Premium spend usually has no upper limit; agents can spend as much as they want to promote themselves or their listings.Facebook launched its Dynamic Ads for Real Estate product last August. Two months later, Zillow announced a partnership with Facebook and “Premier Agent Direct,” an advertising product that pushes ads directly to Facebook.Zillow’s reaction is straightforward - the move gives it a seat at the table. With Facebook’s potential competition in the space, Zillow has decided the best way to stay relevant is to embrace the new Facebook advertising product and offer it to its existing customers.Zillow’s Premier Agent Direct productAt the time, Zillow said it “wasn’t just buying ads and reselling them.” In reality, that’s exactly what it’s doing, but with the benefit of using Zillow’s user data to improve relevance and targeting. Zillow has assumed the role of a middle man. Agents can go directly to Facebook to spend their ad dollars, or they can continue spending with Zillow and get exposure on Facebook. It’s a win-win where Zillow stays relevant, Facebook generates ad revenue, and agents maximize their exposure across multiple channels.Each option has its own benefits. Buying ads directly from Facebook gives agents more control and highlights their brand, compared to a co-branded experience through Zillow.For Agents: Buying from Facebook vs. Buying from ZillowFacebook’s entry into real estate will illuminate two key strategic pivot points, around which the Facebook vs. real estate portal competition will focus.The first strategic pivot revolves around the user experience, pitting search vs. match. The current consumer experience on real estate portals is focused around searching and browsing. Visitors scan a map, enter search criteria, or browse through featured listings. It’s the equivalent of flipping through a glossy magazine or scanning the pages of a newspaper classified section.The very nature of the Facebook product lends itself to matching experience. Real estate listings will be targeted to consumers based on what Facebook knows about them (in the same way it already targets advertising). This targeting is among the most sophisticated in the business given the amount of information Facebook knows about its users. The majority of Facebook users won’t be searching for real estate; they will see real estate presented to them.The second key strategic pivot is all-of-market vs. some-of-market. Real estate portals maintain their reputation as the best place to find a home because they have all of the inventory available in the market. When a consumer is searching for a new home, they want to look where all of the properties for sale are available.Facebook’s marketplace strategy, on the other hand, is not predicated on having all of the available real estate listings. At least for the foreseeable future, the listings available will be those uploaded by its advertising clients. So while the consumer experience on Facebook will target and match listings directly to visitors, it won’t represent the entire market of possible houses for sale.This leaves a competitive opening for real estate portals. As long as the portals have a greater inventory than Facebook (which we believe will be true in the medium-term), their benefit to consumers is clear. Do you want access to all of the market or only some of the market?Facebook represents a clear and present danger for real estate portals around the world. It’s here, it’s growing, and it’s coming to eat your lunch.Competitive Advantages: Facebook vs. Real Estate PortalsWe believe a response strategy should center around the following:Facebook’s deeper move into real estate—both in rentals and for sale listings—represents an opportunity for agents and brokerages and a strategic threat to a range of existing businesses. For real estate portals in particular, the first battleground is agent premium spend. Facebook is giving agents a new, powerful choice for where to spend money on leads.This situation poses a dilemma for real estate portals. Do they cooperate with Facebook as “frenemies,” as Zillow has done, or do they work to stifle Facebook’s momentum at all costs?It is our belief that Facebook is here to stay in real estate, and will continue providing a positive ROI to agents looking for leads. In the near term, real estate portals need to take action to cement their position as the best place to advertise properties for sale and for agents to generate leads. The good news, for portals, is that they have a fighting chance.This article was written by Mike DelPrete and Sib Mahapatra.

4079395,102795,2017-06-07T03:08:35-04:00,"The industry is up in arms about Zillow displacing agents and brokerages, but the data doesn't support it.
        Instant Offers is about giving consumers choice, expanding the existing lead marketplace and providing a new source of revenue with seller leads.
        Zillow is not well-positioned to make a big move against the industry. Its revenue is not diversified and there is a strong No. 2 on the market.","Over the past week, real estate has been dominated by news of Zillow Group's (NASDAQ:Z)(NASDAQ:ZG) Instant Offers. The new program, which allows prospective home sellers to receive instant offers on their homes, has been covered across the industry, with the reaction - as one would expect - largely negative.A thought-provoking article in VentureBeat rhetorically wondered whether Zillow could ""Uber-ize"" the hundred-billion-dollar real estate brokerage business. The author claims that Zillow is well-positioned to disrupt the industry and capture an even larger share of the brokerage market.All up, there's an immense amount of interest related to Zillow disrupting or displacing the traditional real estate industry structure. It's a huge opportunity, but one fraught with risk.I'm going to approach this situation from two angles: my own time as head of strategy for a publicly-listed, multi-billion dollar business, and what the data tells us.The key strategic question in all of this is whether Instant Offers is an offensive, defensive, or opportunistic move by Zillow?If Instant Offers is an offensive move and amounts to Zillow's first salvo against the real estate industry, it's a strange one. It's just too far removed from the endgame of displacing real estate agents. The risk doesn't match up with the reward.Or, perhaps it's a defensive move against the rapid rise of Opendoor and its growing list of national competitors. With Opendoor raising over $300 million U.S. and valued at more than $1 billion U.S., it's difficult to ignore. But, even a disruptive operation such as Opendoor still needs to sell houses, and those houses will appear on Zillow. And with a two-percent market share in the Phoenix market, it still has niche appeal - not exactly an existential threat to Zillow.So, the most likely answer is that Instant Offers is an opportunistic move by Zillow. It wants to capitalize on the growing consumer demand for instant home offers, and sees it as a potential new revenue stream, whereby it can collect and monetize seller leads.This fits well with Zillow's existing business model: It continues to operate as a marketplace, monetizes leads, and sells those leads to real estate agents. It's a natural extension, rather than a radical disruption.Real estate websites around the globe have the same problem: a love-hate relationship with their biggest customers - real estate agents. The top sites are fighting a constant battle to extract more money from their customers through regular price rises and value-added services.On the other hand, real estate agents pay the sites for advertising, exposure, and leads, because of the clear return on investment, but do so begrudgingly and with a sense of fear. Most agents are afraid of these sites gaining too much power, continually raising prices, and perhaps even replacing them with an online-only offering.So, while real estate sites are best positioned to disrupt the real estate industry by displacing agents, they're also the least likely to do so, because agents are their biggest customers and source of revenue.Case in point: The Trade Me Property price rise. While I was at Trade Me, New Zealand's dominant horizontal, we initiated a modest price rise for agents. It was a change from an all-you-can-eat model with a flat subscription fee towards a pay-per-listing fee. It was not well-received.Real estate agents across New Zealand were angry. They did not take kindly to a price rise and organized themselves around our rival and No. 2 on the market, the industry-owned RealEstate.co.nz. The impact was a material narrowing of the traffic gap between both sites - arguably the most important performance indicator for a real estate website (see Network Effects for more on that).Source: ProperazziTrade Me Property's traffic lead went from five times to three times the traffic of the No. 2 rival, a huge drop. Increasing prices for real estate agents - let alone disrupting them - isn't easy.(Zillow's traffic is approximately three times higher than its top competitor in the U.S., namely Realtor.com.)I believe there are a number of critical preconditions for a real estate website to truly disrupt real estate agents:Most real estate platforms capture their revenue from agents. Whether spending their own money to promote themselves or buy leads or spending their vendor's money to advertise a property, the agent controls the purse strings.In the case of Zillow, around 70 percent of its revenue comes from real estate agents. While not surprising, it's still a big number that reflects a poor level of diversification. Furthermore, as we can see below, that number as a percent hasn't changed over the past four years. Zillow does not look like a business trying to diversify its revenue.Zillow fully believes it is at the beginning of its journey, not the end. It sees plenty of runway left to grow its revenue even higher as more spend goes online. And the numbers prove it: revenue grew 31 percent from FY 2015 into FY 2016, higher than any of its global peers.In other words: Zillow is making a ton of money with its current business model and sees plenty of growth left. Why put that at risk and kill the goose that lays the golden eggs?We can also see that Zillow's revenue share from agents is on par with its global peers. Most of the major players illustrated above receive between 65 percent and 75 percent of revenue from agents.Zoopla, the single exception, has taken a proactive strategy to diversify its revenue streams away from agents. In 2015, it acquired uSwitch, a price comparison business, for £160 million and the acquisitions have continued at a brisk pace since then, all in an effort to expand along the value chain and become a one-stop-shop for consumers and real estate professionals.As opposed to Zillow, Zoopla looks like a business that is diversifying its revenue streams. With that clear strategy in place, revenue diversification has followed.Of all the major real estate websites in the world, Zoopla is best positioned from a revenue diversification standpoint to disrupt the industry.Given what we know about its strategy and what the data shows us, I consider it unlikely that Zillow is making moves against the industry. The existing business is just too lucrative with plenty of growth left to put it all at risk.Rather, Instant Offers is about giving consumers choice, expanding the existing lead marketplace, and a new source of revenue with seller leads. It's also just a test.Zillow is not well-positioned to make a big move against the industry. Its revenue is not diversified and there is a strong No. 2 on the market.Regardless, Instant Offers should be instantly interesting to all of the major real estate websites around the world. It's capitalizing on a pro-consumer offering that can make these sites more valuable to consumers around the world. I guarantee many - myself included - will be watching this test with great interest."
4054239,60151,2017-03-10T15:14:15-05:00,"A hedge fund believes Zillow can be a $50 billion company, which is roughly 8X its current market capitalization.The hedge fund is completely correct that Zillow is operating in a burgeoning industry, which will expand at a prodigious rate over the next few years.However, its estimates are egregiously optimistic, and there are significant risks on the horizon, which can substantially stymie Zillow's growth.","Zillow Group (NASDAQ:Z) (NASDAQ:ZG) has recently been touted by a hedge fund as its best pick. In November 2016, a well-known hedge fund in Australia, Caledonia, took a stake in Zillow and explained that the company was its largest ever bet in its 22-year history. Caledonia's portfolio manager, Michael Messara, explained that his fund believed there was significant upside: ""[W]e believe Zillow will be a $US50 billion enterprise value company - around seven times the size it is today."" (Zillow has since fallen a bit, so now its estimate is closer to 8x its current level). The fund believes the Australian online real estate is a blueprint for other markets and thinks that the US will follow suit. However, I believe this fund is being way too sanguine about Zillow's future prospects, as there are significant risks on the horizon.Source: Zillow.comRoadmap to My AnalysisI will first give a brief overview of Zillow's business. Then I'll quickly discuss recent news and will provide a more granular overview of how the company's business has been operating. Following that section, I'll discuss the competitive landscape. Afterwards, I'll discuss its recent performance, then highlight various risks, and will discuss potential negative and positive catalysts. I'll then conclude with a valuation section and summarize my findings.About Zillow GroupZillow Group, Inc. operates real estate and home-related information marketplaces on mobile and the Web, with a complementary portfolio of brands and products to help people find information about homes and connect with local professionals. Zillow Group's brands focus on all stages of the home lifecycle: renting, buying, selling, financing and home improvement.Zillow's database has more than 110 million U.S. homes - homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market. In addition, Zillow Group provides advertising services to tens of thousands of real estate agents and rental and mortgage professionals, helping them connect to consumers.Individuals and businesses that use Zillow's mobile applications and websites have updated information on more than 68 million homes and added more than 456 million home photos, creating exclusive home profiles not available anywhere else. These profiles include detailed information about homes, including property facts, listing information and purchase and sale data. Zillow also uses proprietary automated valuation models to provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on more than 100 million U.S. homes.Its home-related marketplaces benefit from network effects. As more consumers go to its mobile applications and websites to use its products and services, more real estate, rental and mortgage professionals contribute content to distinguish themselves, thereby making its marketplaces more useful and attracting additional consumers. As of December 31, 2016, it had published more than 2.6 million reviews, including more than 2.3 million reviews of local real estate agents and approximately 336,000 reviews of mortgage professionals submitted by users on Zillow.Recent AcquisitionIn February 2015, Zillow closed on its $2.5 billion acquisition of Trulia. Zillow now operates under the name Zillow Group, which is comprised of four real estate brands: Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy, HotPads, and Naked Apartments.Source: Zillowgroup.comAt the time of the acquisition, CEO Spencer Rascoff said:It is notable to mention that Caledonia believed Zillow is worth $50 million while Zillow's CEO identified its total addressable market as $13 billion. Does Caledonia sound a bit too sanguine to you now?Explanation of Dual SharesI just briefly want to mention why Zillow has two ticker symbols. In August 2015, shares of Zillow Group split into two trading tickers: Z and ZG. Zillow created a new class of shares, non-voting Class C shares, that was divvied up between its Class A and B shareholders. The C shares trade under the ticker symbol Z while Class A shares trade under the ticker ZG. The company created this new stock to make acquisitions and compensate executives. However, for investment purposes, there is no material difference between these two share classes.More Granular Business ExplanationZillow generates revenue through two separate avenues: marketplace advertising and display advertising. It sells its advertising to real estate, rental, and mortgage professionals.Premier Agent Advertising New Auction-Based Pricing PlatformBefore the latest quarter, Zillow charged customers for its Premier Agent product based on the number of impressions delivered on its buyers' agent list in zip codes purchased and a contracted maximum cost per impression.However, in the most recent quarter, it implemented a new auction-based pricing method for its Premier Agent product. In this new system, it determines cost per impression delivered in each zip code based upon the total amount spent by Premier Agents to purchase impressions in the zip code during the month.This allows for dynamic pricing for the cost per impression, based upon the demand in that particular zip code. This new pricing method complements its self-serve account interface, which it introduced to Premier Agents over the course of 2016. The interface includes account management tools that allow agent advertisers to independently control their budgets, impression buys, and the duration of their advertising commitment. Management did not comment on how this change has been impacting its business, and in the 10-K said:In its earnings call, management gave further color on how the model will benefit ""elite agents"":While this change benefits higher-performing agents, it also hurts other agents. As such, the number of Premier Agent advertisers on its platform declined on a y/y basis. Management is making a bet that the benefit of having an auction-based system will offset the decline in the number of agents willing to advertise on its platform.One corollary benefit of this is that customers will be offered advertisements with more experienced and effective agents. This could lead to more customer loyalty and drive consumer growth on the platform. On the other hand, by limiting the number of agents on the platform, Zillow is reducing the overall demand for ad space. In the next few quarters, we will have more information to determine if this change is inevitably beneficial or harmful to Zillow's business.My take is that it will overall be a negative change. I believe that initially, higher-performing agents will be willing to pay more for these ads, which will offset the declining demand from fewer overall agents selling ads on the platform. However, I think once these agents get a critical mass of deals though Zillow, they won't be reliant on the platform, as word-of-mouth is a prevalent method to get referred to an agent. Once an agent has a certain number of happy customers, they can rely on those customers referring their friends and family to them. At that point, those agents can reduce their marketing expenditures on Zillow. Of course, this is just my theory, and I could be wrong.Display AdvertisingIn addition to the marketplace advertising, Zillow generates revenue through display advertisements. Its display advertising primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost-per-click basis. It offers customers display advertising opportunities on its mobile applications through display ads that are optimized for the mobile experience, on its home page, and on individual web pages through graphical displays and text links. Management has been less focused on this business segment and revenue has begun to decline from display advertising.New Construction - Emerging MarketplaceIn the earnings call, management discussed this new marketplace and believed its total addressable market opportunity is $1 billion for this new segment. This platform allows homebuilders to advertise their available lots and styles to the public. Builders can display real-time lot availability on search results and maps. Further, builders will be able to receive information on consumer behavior in this platform. This will enable them to assess local market conditions and determine user preferences, helping them make decisions regarding their product positions, land acquisition, and how to improve their marketing efforts. As this is a new platform, it remains to be seen if builders will adopt using it.CompetitionZillow has two main competitors left, after the acquisition of Trulia.com: Realtor.com and redfin.com. Realtor.com was acquired by News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWS) (NASDAQ:NWSA) and recently settled a lawsuit against Zillow for $130 million. The lawsuit regarded a dispute over trade secrets and executive poaching.When it comes to availability and accuracy of data, Zillow doesn't compare to its competitors. For the real estate sector, the best information comes from multiple listing services (MLS) sites. An MLS is a suite of services that real estate brokers use to establish contractual offers of compensation (among brokers) and accumulate and disseminate information to enable appraisals.Today, through more than 800 MLSs, brokers share information on properties they have listed and invite other brokers to cooperate in their sale in exchange for compensation if they produce the buyer. Sellers benefit by increased exposure to their property. Buyers benefit because they can obtain information about all MLS-listed properties while working with only one broker.As the official site of the National Association of Realtors, Realtor.com receives listing data from more than 800 MLSs. This data is used to populate its consumer-facing home listing service, which covers more than 97% of all MLSs listed for sale properties. Moreover, Redfin is a broker, so it is also able to access MLSs to secure data for its listing website.In contrast, because Zillow is not a broker, it isn't able to receive such broad access to MLSs. As such, Zillow must rely on the expensive and complicated process of entering into separate agreements with multiple data providers. This amalgamation of data collection can lead to less reliable data that can mislead its users and lead to them favoring the more reliable competitors.In fact, Zillow lists this risk in its 10-K as a risk factor:By not having the most comprehensive database and by having to go through more expensive efforts to obtain its listing information, Zillow is at a serious disadvantage to its competitors.Competing For Ad DollarsZillow also faces competition for ad dollars from several other competitors. Specifically, it competes with various real estate websites and applications, local brokerage services, general search engines, and social media sites (i.e. LinkedIn (LNKD), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and Instagram). Additionally, Zillow faces competition for these ad dollars from traditional media operators such as newspapers, TV, magazines, and home/apartment publications.Zillow did recently partner with Facebook to offer a precision-ad targeting program. This program enables real estate agents to connect to Facebook with home shoppers who are using its site or Trulia, which it recently acquired. The technology identifies home shoppers or sellers who are using Zillow or Trulia and connects with them on Facebook. Agents are able to feature a specific listing or highlight new listings for recently sold homes. The company says the feature available on desktop and mobile is a chance to connect with shoppers and sellers on a social media platform that they are using every day.Although it will be beneficial for agents to get use of Facebook's customer data, there are two negative implications of this partnership. First, although we don't know the exact figures, I'm sure Zillow has to pay Facebook a hefty amount for this targeted advertising, which will eat into its margins. Moreover, this underscores the risk that Facebook represents. At Facebook's size, there is just no way that Zillow could compete with it if Facebook decided to offer a similar platform. I just don't see Zillow having any real competitive advantage to thwart Facebook from encroaching on its business.Recent PerformanceIn the latest quarter, Zillow reported revenue of $227.6 million, increasing 34% y/y, which exceeded the high end of its guidance range. The largest segment of its revenue came from its Premier Agent Revenue, which increased 32% y/y to $164.3 million. An important figure that was disclosed was that there was a 100% y/y increase in the number of agent advertisers that spend more than $5,000 per month. However, the number of Premier Agent advertisers declined to 84,151, as its new auction-based pricing model benefits the top performing agents, as I discussed before.Now I'll break down the other business segments:Overall, Zillow reported a GAAP net loss of $23.5 million (roughly 10% of revenue) compared to a GAAP net loss of $25.7 million (about 15% of revenue) in Q4 2015.Upon a cursory look, Zillow's adjusted EBITDA numbers appear to be trending in the right direction. In this quarter, Zillow reported adjusted EBITDA of $54.7 million (about 24% of revenue), which is a significant increase from last quarter's $20.4 million (about 12% of revenue).However, its adjusted EBITDA figure isn't such an accurate measure of the true nature of its business. Zillow's adjusted EDITDA excludes stock-based compensation, which is a significant figure for Zillow. In 2016, Zillow reported adjusted EBITDA of $144.8 million, but stock-based compensation was a staggering $106 million. That means, when including stock-based compensation, it had an EBITDA of just $37.9 million. Moreover, when including the one-time litigation settlement with News Corp., Zillow had -$92.1 million in EBITDA in 2016.GuidanceManagement guided that it expects to exceed the $1 billion annual revenue mark in 2017 and guided for revenue to be in the range of $1.03-1.05 billion. The midpoint of this guidance represents a 23% y/y increase in revenue. It also guided for adjusted EBITDA of between $190 million and $210 million. The midpoint for this guidance represents 19% of revenue. However, that guidance excludes stock-based compensation, which is expected to be between $106-111 million.Source: Zillow Q4 Press ReleaseFinally, the company guided for a net loss of between $20.2 million and $40.2 million. This full-year net loss would represent a vast improvement from 2016's reported $220.4 million net loss. Even if you exclude the $130 million litigation settlement, that marks a significant improvement.Other RisksCopyright Infringement Litigation with VHTThere is another notable litigation risk, which was explained in its 10-K:StreetEasy RiskAdditionally, there has been a lot of backlash from brokers when Zillow rolled out its Premier Agent feature on StreetEasy. Now brokers on StreetEasy are concerned that buyers will be directed to third-party agents who have no connection to the property rather than to the listing agent with the exclusive. This costs listing agents commissions, forcing them to split with brokers who get leads simply because they pay StreetEasy to be designated as a ""Premier Agent.""Previously, StreetEasy generated revenue from featured listings and display advertisements. This changed has led to the heads of some brokerage firms calling for a boycott of the platform, and there has been discussion of a Real Estate Board of New York-funded multiple listings service that's currently under development as a back-end platform for brokers to become a consumer-facing alternative to StreetEasy.Nonetheless, although this threat is a risk worth mentioning, its implications are relatively limited, as the revenue from StreetEasy is lumped together into a category with Naked Apartments, rentals, and New Construction, and in the aggregate, that category only generated roughly $30 million last quarter.Notable NegativesReliance on Sales TeamsRelying on a sales team to sell ads to real estate agents does not bode well for Zillow's scalability. Sales teams are expensive and Zillow has not shown its ability to retain these real estate agents on the platform for the long term. It did increase the number of advertisers spending more than $5,000 per month by more than 100% y/y in the last quarter. However, it is shedding the total number of agent advertisers to do so, as it makes advertising on the platform more expensive for less-effective agents.I believe that these top agents will hit a critical mass of customers, and will be able to rely on word-of-mouth advertising to sustain their business, and thus stop their marketing efforts on Zillow. If this process occurs, there will be significant churn in terms of agent advertisers on the platform, and Zillow will not be able to end its reliance on an expensive sales team. Moreover, with the best agents leaving the platform, Zillow's ad costs will face a cap.Convertible NotesIn December 2016, the company issued $460 million in 2% convertible senior notes due in 2021. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2% per year, payable semiannually, but can be converted into Zillow's Class C stock. The conversion rate is $52.36 per share so these very long-dated convertible notes can be quite dilutive and limit the upside beyond the conversion price.PositivesPercentage of Online Real Estate MarketAccording to comScore, Zillow Group's brands represent nearly three quarters of market share of all mobile exclusive visitors to the real estate category. Moreover, the majority of its traffic comes directly, and is not dependent on search engines, which shows that Zillow Group's brands have strong customer recognition and loyalty. Moreover, its traffic continues to expand. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, traffic to its consumer brands Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy, HotPads and Naked Apartments grew to 140.1 million average monthly unique users, an increase of 13% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015.Although these figures are positive, I don't see how Zillow can thwart off competition. Management is investing in its brand to generate customer loyalty, but there really is nothing to stop competitors from offering a similar product. Facebook could easily enter and dominant this space. Moreover, with an expensive, and sometimes inaccurate, method to get listings onto its site, Zillow faces a risk in offering customers a smaller selection of houses and apartments to sort though as compared to its competitors.Market OpportunityAccording to data published by the National Association of Realtors, in 2016, approximately 5.6 million existing and 592,000 new homes in the U.S. were sold for an aggregate transaction value of approximately $1.8 trillion. U.S. real estate agents and brokers spent an estimated $5.9 billion on residential advertising in 2016 according to data compiled from Borrell Associates (its full report is behind a paywall). Moreover, the same report from Borrell Associates found that U.S. real estate developers spent an estimated $1 billion on residential advertising in 2016.For the rental market, Borrell Associates estimated that $1.9 billion was spent on advertising rental properties in 2016. Moreover, it estimated that U.S. residential mortgage providers spent approximately $6.2 billion on marketing their services and loan products to mortgage borrowers.During the earnings call, management discussed how it believes ""the opportunity in front of [them] remains massive."" To give an indication of its future growth opportunity, management used an estimate that in 2016, there were approximately $87 billion in total real estate commissions in the U.S. Of that commission revenue, it earned $604 million in Premier Agent revenue, and delivered nearly 17 million leads to Premier Agents.It further estimated that those leads earned about $4.4 billion in commissions, which represents roughly 5% of all commissions in the U.S. Management said its leads represent a small percentage of the total, but was bullish about its ability to grow that percentage and cited solid growth from last year. In 2015, it generated 12 million leads or 3.9% of U.S. commissions.Furthermore, it is worth noting that the housing market may face a boon from Millennials moving out of their parents' house in the next few years. The share of Millennials that are living with their parents has been growing at a prodigious rate and is now over 33%.Source: Zillow PresentationNet Operating Loss CarryforwardsAs of December 31, 2016, the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $893.3 million, state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $13.5 million, and net tax credit carryforwards of approximately $24.3 million. It is notable to mention that if Zillow is acquired, the acquirer will have not have the use of these tax loss carryforwards since it will be an ""ownership change"" under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, which will limit the acquirer's use of them. However, if Zillow does eventually become profitable, it can use these to offset its taxable income.ValuationThere is no direct competitor to compare Zillow against, so I found a peer group that I believe provides a good comparison. Each of these companies runs a platform with a similar type of business model to Zillow. The comparable companies I've identified are Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), Yelp (NYSE:YELP), and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP).On a relative basis, I believe Zillow is overvalued. Its price-to-sales ratio is around double every other competitors. Now, you may think that is due to Zillow possibly having a much higher growth rate, however, that just isn't the case, as shown by the second chart below. Zillow's quarterly revenue growth is not much higher than Expedia's or Yelp's. Furthermore, each other company in peer group is currently profitable while Zillow is not, as shown by the third chart below:ZG PS Ratio (Annual) data by YChartsZ Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsZ Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsNow, some may argue that Zillow is investing in the future by growing its brand and generating a mass of users before focusing on profitability. However, I do not believe it is creating any sort of competitive advantage. Moreover, its reliance on an amalgamation of services to get listings is a significant risk that can completely up-end its business. Further, I don't see it thwarting off Facebook, if it decides to enter this market; Zillow just does not have any way to compete with the depth and breadth of Facebook's collection of user data.Final RemarksI believe Caledonia was way too optimistic in its evaluation of Zillow. Although I believe Zillow is operating in a growing market, I believe there are too many risks to justify its current valuation, and it is certainly not going to increase 8x its current level, as Caledonia's analysis suggested."
4070765,102795,2017-05-08T15:40:57-04:00,"Zillow continues to edge toward profitability with overall expenses coming in line with revenue.Overall revenue growth is re-accelerating matched by increased spending on sales and marketing.Technology-and-development spend has slowed considerably, contributing to slower overall expense growth.","What's interesting in the Zillow Group (NASDAQ:Z) (NASDAQ:ZG) results for Q1? Here are highlights with charts and commentary.First: The profitability chestnut. Cutting out all the noise for a moment (including stock-based compensation), let's focus simply on revenue and expenses.One of the biggest questions for Zillow is: Can it turn a profit?Zillow has lost millions of dollars during the past few years and has yet to turn a profit even though it's on track to generate more than $1 billion U.S. in revenue this year.So any signs that give clues to whether Zillow can and will become profitable are quite relevant.Zillow has done a good job over the past three quarters; expenses are finally matching revenue. Quarterly revenue growth has picked up steam as well, up from a relatively slow Q4. In Q1, revenue was up 8 percent from Q4 and 32 percent from Q1 in FY2016.In particular, the sales and marketing expense is quite illuminating. While Q1 revenue was up 8 percent from the previous quarter, expenses were up 9 percent overall and the sales and marketing expense was up 18 percent.In absolute terms, revenue was up $18 million U.S., expenses were up $19.7 million, and sales and marketing $15.8 million.But, looked at over the past year, the story changes. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue is up 32 percent, expenses up 10 percent and sales and marketing 7 percent.Again, looking at year-over-year growth in absolute terms, revenue was up $60 million, expenses $22.6 million and sales and marketing up $6.8 million.Looking further, we can see a rough proxy of how effective sales and marketing spend is in driving revenue. For the past several quarters, each dollar spent on sales and marketing generates from $2 to $2.50 in revenue. And it's slowly trending upwards.There was a big increase in sales and marketing spend in Q1 of FY2017, so relative effectiveness has dropped slightly. But overall it's a good direction to be heading in - upward that is. Another interesting metric is technology and development spend. It's finally leveling off. In fact, it's flat when compared to the previous quarter.Technology is surely a critical component of Zillow's consumer and customer proposition, so tech spend will always remain high.But, if you're anxious for Zillow to turn a profit, the relatively flat growth is an important factor and a good signal.Overall, it was a good quarter for Zillow. Not simply for the headline revenue growth but for the drivers behind it that signal a meaningful turn for the company towards sustained profitability."
4138937,103480,2018-01-21T12:34:26-05:00,"Zillow, the largest online real estate platform, has seen nice growth over the past year, with its top line growing ~25% to a $1 billion+ run rate.Its stock has pulled back in recent months, however, on concerns over its growth trajectory and profitability.Zillow's growing user base and revenues are setting up a basis for future profits - it shouldn't be the core focus now.The stock also hasn't quite shaken off the tremors that resulted from the home valuation lawsuits that Zillow got dismissed in the summer.The company's suite of brands and breadth of real estate data make it a structural long-term winner.","As I continue to search for beaten-down tech stocks to invest in for 2018 in the hopes of a pullback, my attention has turned to Zillow (NASDAQ:Z). I'm a fairly heavy user of Zillow myself - when it comes to buying and renting properties, there are few platforms that are as broad-reaching as Zillow is. An investment property of mine just locked in a one-year lease, and the tenant found it through Zillow.Zillow has become rather ubiquitous in today's real estate market, now deeply entrenched into the process we use for researching and executing real estate transactions. As real estate remains one of the last bastions to truly undergo a radical technology makeover, Zillow is well positioned to capture the tailwinds of this trend: its data trove, complete suite of tools for agents, and partnerships with mortgage originators make it a truly one-of-a-kind and end-to-end tool for bringing real estate into the digital age.Its stock of late, however, has not reflected this rosy narrative. Though Zillow is still up by double-digit percentage gains in the past twelve months, it's underperformed against the major U.S. averages and still hasn't been able to reclaim the pre-summer highs in the $50s.Z data by YChartsThis is despite the fact that Zillow managed to shake off the high-profile lawsuits over its Zestimates in August. For a bit of background: Zillow was sued for supposed inaccuracy of its ""Zestimate"" tool, which uses various data points to try to pinpoint the value of any given home. Plaintiffs charged that low Zestimates failed to capture the value of their home and prevented its sale. Zillow, which argued that Zestimates were algorithmically derived from a number of data points and never claimed complete accuracy (valuation is an art, after all), and was not a bona fide appraisal, successfully got the charges dismissed.The fact that Zestimates worked its way into a high-profile suit, ironically, illustrates just how prevalent Zillow is in the real estate world. Across its portfolio of brands (shown below), Zillow has become a dominant market force in real estate and its valuations, with its data and estimates becoming widely used (certainly enough to warrant a lawsuit, no mater how frivolous).Figure 1. Zillow brandsSource: Zillow investor relationsThese are the types of technology companies that make for good long-term investments: dominant positions in their space, rich in data, and macro trends driving in their favor. Investors bearish on Zillow for its current failure to produce profits are missing the huge market opportunity in front of it.Zillow has a diversified revenue stream, as shown in the chart below from a recent investor presentation. It generates the majority of its top line from ""Premier Agent"" fees - which is the fee that real estate agents pay to Zillow to have their name and contact information displayed on a Zillow home listing.Presumably, home buyers who are searching on Zillow themselves don't already have an agent they are working with - thus, when they click on a home they are interested in, they are displayed a selection of agents they can work with. Real estate agents find this exposure extremely lucrative for driving new business, and that's why they spent an aggregate of ~$750 million in 2017 on Zillow fees. In addition to marketing exposure, they also receive a suite of Zillow-branded tools for managing their business.Figure 2. Zillow revenue streamsSource: Zillow Q4 investor deckOutside of agent fees, Zillow also collects revenues from banks and other mortgage originators for advertising their offerings on the Zillow platform, as well as from software offerings sold to other real estate interests.This hopefully illustrates the point that Zillow is deeply entrenched across all parties involved in a real estate transaction: buyers, sellers, agents, mortgage originators and developers. They gravitate toward Zillow through the sheer scale of its platform. Zillow has succeeded in becoming one of the largest online real estate marketplaces, and it's also been extremely successful in monetizing its popularity through both advertising and software solutions.Zillow has grown at a rapid clip in the past few years, capitalizing both on new offerings as well as the continued domination of its core brands. The next two charts show the company's ballooning in annual revenues, as well as the growth in its user base:Figure 3. Zillow revenue growthFigure 4. Zillow MAUs and visit statisticsSource: Zillow investor relationsKey points to notice here: Zillow continues to grow at a high double-digit percentage. Guidance for FY18 has not yet been released, but even growing ~20% coming off a ~$1 billion base can translate to huge bottom-line profits - especially because Zillow, as an internet company with few gross costs, has an ultrahigh gross margin of 92%. Each dollar of incremental revenue flows almost purely to the bottom line.Zillow's adjusted EBITDA margins have grown each year too - this year, the company is expecting a record 22% adj. EBITDA margin. The company is still spending a little under half of its revenues on sales and marketing - both to advertise its platform as well as to acquire new Premier Agents, both activities that drive long-term growth. Zillow shouldn't be faulted for prioritizing growth over near-term profits - when a company has cornered its market the way Zillow has, it would be almost irresponsible not to continue expanding in it.As investors, we want to see that the company's high spending on sales and marketing is translating into results: and we can see that in both the robust revenue growth as well as the visitation statistics. MAUs in Q3 rose to 175.2 million, up 7% y/y. Note how remarkable this MAU statistic is: while Zillow has some international activities, it is primarily focused on the U.S., and 175 million is more than half of the adult population of the U.S.Note that there is some seasonality in MAU and visitation metrics - real estate activity tends to heat up in the summer (Q2) as many life transitions (graduations, new jobs) tend to occur in that time period. The sequential drop from Q2 to Q3 MAUs shouldn't be viewed as a concern.For a company that's this dominant, Zillow relatively undervalued as a multiple of revenues. While a comparison to fellow Internet company Snap (NYSE:SNAP) isn't completely fair as the two operate entirely different businesses, it's eye-opening to note that Snap trades at a revenue valuation that's double that of Zillow.This is despite the fact that Snap operates in a much more competitive environment (locked into fierce competition against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)), is losing far more money, and have similar user counts (Yes, it's true that Snap's ~170 million DAUs aren't an apples-to-apples comparison to Zillow's 175 million MAUs, but the fact that their reach is about the same is instructive to note).Z EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsAside from Snap, Zillow's valuation also sits below a number of other online advertising and marketplace peers. With 92% gross margins and 25% growth, along with positive EBITDA, Zillow should have plenty of room to move higher.The bottom line: investors clamoring for profits in Zillow right now are extremely short-sighted. The company has asserted its dominance in the real estate technology space and is continuing to invest in its growth, and it's well positioned to become a true behemoth in the next 3-5 years.No one is arguing with Facebook's business model now after it's become massively profitable, but there were naysayers immediately post-IPO that doubted it would ever have a sustainable business model. Give Zillow more time to achieve its scale potential and the profits will come. At current levels, after suffering a multi-month pullback, Zillow is a stock worth betting on."
4163577,102795,2018-04-17T16:35:42-04:00,"Last week, Zillow announced it was going to start directly buying and selling houses.This is really about Zillow’s core advertising business and delivering high-quality leads to agents.If Zillow is able to sell a guaranteed lead to its premier agents, it could charge $1,875 per lead -- an 18x improvement over the current average.","Last week, Zillow (Z)(ZG) announced it was going to start directly buying and selling houses. More specifically, it will actively participate in its Instant Offers Marketplace, which allows consumers to get instant offers on their homes (the iBuyer model).Yes, buying and selling houses is a big deal for Zillow. And yes, it’s a huge shift for a marketplace. But this is really about Zillow’s core advertising business and delivering high-quality leads to agents. In this case, it’s the ultimate lead.In 2016, Zillow generated nearly 17 million leads for its premier agents. That’s more than three times the total number of annual residential transactions in the U.S. Clearly, each lead is warm at best and doesn’t always result in a transaction.If Zillow follows through with its iBuyer plans to buy and sell houses -- using agents on both sides of the transaction -- it will have created the most valuable lead possible: a guaranteed buyer or seller. And that’s because the lead is Zillow itself.When Zillow buys a house, it is the buyer, and can effectively sell that guaranteed lead to a premier agent to represent itself. A few months later when Zillow flips and sells the house, it is the seller, and can sell that guaranteed lead to its premier agent partners. And it can sell these leads for many multiples more than it currently sells buyer leads.The current cost per lead on Zillow varies wildly by market, but is generally between $20 and $220 per lead. It looks like the average is around $100 per lead. The most expensive is $220 per lead in the hottest and most expensive zip code in New York City.Agent lead referral businesses -- like HomeLight in the U.S. and OpenAgent in Australia -- typically charge agents a 20%–25% commission as a referral fee if the transaction closes. In other words, if an agent gets a lead and closes the transaction, they pay out 1/4 of their commission. For an average-priced home in the U.S. ($250,000) that equates to $1,875.Using the same logic, if Zillow is able to sell a guaranteed lead to its premier agents, it could charge $1,875 per lead -- an 18x improvement over an average of $100 per lead.If you’re a real estate agent, would you pay $1,875 to make $7,500 (a 3 percent commission on a $250,000 home)? I would. In fact, I’d probably pay more.Zillow says it’s aiming to buy and sell between 300-1,000 houses this year. If Zillow completes 1,000 transactions and charges an average of $1,875 per lead on both the buy and sell side (representing Zillow as the buyer and then the seller), that’s $3.75 million in revenue. Not a very big number compared to the $905 million in premier agent revenue Zillow is projecting for the year.But let’s scale; 1,000 houses is small potatoes. Opendoor is currently buying around 1,000 houses per month. If Zillow were able to match that volume, that’s $45 million in annual revenue. And remember, that’s at a 25% fee. Agents would likely pay more in a bidding system. If Zillow could capture 50% of the commission at the same volume, that’s $90 million in revenue.But that’s not the only way Zillow can make money; it can charge homesellers a fee for the Instant Offer service (in the same way the other iBuyers do). Assuming Zillow charges a 2 percent fee to homesellers (on top of the 6 percent in typical agent commissions), it would make $5 million in revenue on 1,000 transactions (assuming an average home price of $250,000).If Zillow scales up to Opendoor’s volume levels (1,000 transactions per month), that’s $60 million in annual revenue.None of these revenue sources are open to Zillow if it operates an Instant Offers marketplace; it needs to be part of the transaction to generate high-quality leads and charge consumers directly.This has been a fun exercise and I’ve made a ton of assumptions. But the goal is to illustrate the opportunity in front of Zillow and expose some of the (assumed) strategic rationale for this shift -- something a lot of people are completely missing.If Zillow pulls this off, not only will it be in the iBuyer business -- with all of its inherit pros and cons -- it will have managed to create the ultimate, guaranteed real estate lead.P.S. I’ve written a lot about iBuyers, and this note just scratches the surface. Check out the following if you’re interested in learning more:"
4145054,103480,2018-02-09T09:19:40-05:00,"Zillow posted Q4 earnings that beat heavily on revenue and, on a full-year basis, far exceeded the growth outlined at the beginning of the year.Traffic statistics were equally impressive, with unique MAUs and site visits up 8% and 21% respectively in the fourth quarter.Soft guidance was what knocked the stock off course.The guidance weakness may be correlated to the as-yet-unknown impacts of higher rates and a rewritten tax code on the booming real estate market.Over the long term, however, Zillow's massive data trove and major lead in bringing technology and easy-access data to the real estate industry give it a fantastic position for success.","Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), the real estate marketplace site that operates a wide variety of Internet platforms focusing on home sales and rentals (including Trulia and New York-focused StreetEasy), has just reported Q4 and full-year FY17 results that largely came in above expectations. I've found Zillow especially attractive in recent months as both user and viewership metrics point to a fast-growing audience for its offerings. Among Internet platforms, Zillow has also done a remarkable job of monetizing a very popular free platform and remarkably, deriving revenues from subscription fees from the ""premium agents"" who pay to be listed on pages on Zillow. Unlike many of its Internet sector brethren, advertising revenues are actually a very small portion of the company's top line (and in fact, the company is deliberately tuning down its advertising efforts to focus on the user experience and monetize through fee-based revenues from real estate professionals).The January/February time frame has been a bit of a challenging period for Zillow, but then again, it has been that way for most companies. Immediately after posting Q4 earnings, Zillow's stock dropped like a rock. Though the company certainly isn't cheap after a successful recovery since early September, Zillow is still off its all-time highs and the earnings selloff provides an opportunity to build a position at an ~8% discount to recent trading levels.Z data by YChartsFor those willing to play the long game, Zillow is one of those companies that is almost certain to multiply in size over the next few years, despite quarter-to-quarter fluctuations: real estate being one of the last bastions to truly undergo a tech revolution, Zillow stands to capture the tailwinds of millennials entering the high-earning years of their careers (and thus, the home-buying phases of their lives). More and more housing activity will shift online, and the real estate agent and mortgage companies that feed into Zillow's revenues are going to be increasingly willing to pay to be where their customers are, which, increasingly, is Zillow.com.The dark cloud revolving around Zillow's earnings is the perceived weakness of its guidance, amplified by the fact that the company reported earnings on the second-worst day for the market so far in 2018 (with the Dow and S&P 500 off nearly 4%).Zillow provides a guidance outlook that is far more detailed than most companies. See its fresh guidance below:Figure 1. Zillow guidanceSource: Zillow investor relationsThe reason I'm more inclined to view this news as mixed: full-year 2018 guidance of $1.30-1.32 billion (+22% y/y) actually came in two points above analyst expectations for $1.29 billion (+20% y/y). EBITDA guidance of $300-315 million was slightly below expectations for $317 million. But in the grand scheme of things, an upside to revenues will likely trickle down into upside EBITDA as well - so I'd put more emphasis on the robust revenue view.Q1 guidance, however, was a full miss. Analysts had wanted to see $298 million in revenues (above the high end of Zillow's $291-296 million), as well as $69.2 million in EBITDA (about 50% higher than the company's guidance).There's a huge likelihood, however, that Zillow's guidance may just be a statement of uncertainty from the company about the condition of the real estate market (of course, investors don't like uncertainty, but it does leave room for Zillow to perform to the upside). The company has, after all, a long record of strong earnings beats. Under-promise, over-deliver is a tried-and-true strategy.There are plenty of macro reasons to be cautious, and it would be remiss not to acknowledge them as risks. The primary elephants in the room are tax policy and interest rates, with both expected to act as headwinds against U.S. real estate.One of the most controversial elements of the Trump tax policy is the limitation on state and local tax deductions to $10,000 per person, which includes property taxes. This especially hurts high-tax states like California and New York. Add that to the fact that real estate purchased in 2018 and beyond will only have a $750k cap of interest deductions (from a previous $1M), further punishing would-be buyers in these expensive coastal states where real estate prices have shot through the roof and the median home sale in many metro areas is well above $1M.A recent Wall Street Journal article reports that Manhattan real estate sales, for example, have dried up as buyer demand stifles in the wake of tax reform. Add in the fact that higher interest rates from a booming economy are expected to dampen demand and housing prices, and you have a cold wave that's suddenly washing over the real estate industry.Though the macro effects of tax and interest rates on the real estate market are something that even economists can't perfectly predict, there are reasons to be optimistic. The premier agents who make up the bulk of Zillow's revenues probably can't or won't react that quickly to a slowing of sales and advertise less on Zillow's platform. If anything, they'll ramp up marketing and customer acquisition efforts to make up for a business slowdown. If and only if the market slowdown becomes a long-term condition will they truly ratchet back their spending on Zillow.More often than not, guidance usually steals the spotlight instead of the actual results, but Zillow's Q4 numbers certainly deserve some respect. The company generated $282.3 million in revenues for Q4, up 24% y/y and beating analyst consensus of $277.5 million.User metrics were also strong - if the broader market was experiencing a real estate slowdown, Zillow wouldn't know it. In prepared remarks for the company's earnings call, Zillow disclosed MAUs of 152 million (+8% y/y); given that Zillow is predominantly U.S. based, this indicates that nearly half of the U.S. population logs into Zillow at least once a month. Total visits to the site were also up 12% y/y to 1.4 billion, indicating a high degree of user engagement. Strong traffic data for Zillow is a huge support for the company's guidance ranges and indicates that it has the platform and user base to drive sales to premier agents and lenders. As an internet platform, the company's gross margin also remained sky-high at 92%, making its growth extremely accretive to the bottom line.The company generated a fantastic 25% adjusted EBITDA margin ($70.9 million), improving its margin by 1 point from the prior year's Q4. Adjusted EPS of $0.19 was in line.It's also important to note that in closing out fiscal 2017, Zillow's $1.08 billion in revenues represented 27% y/y growth - relative to the 23% the company had expected at the beginning of the year.If we carry that trend forward into 2018, we have an initial full-year guidance range calling for 22% growth that's already 2 points above consensus - given Zillow's history of guiding cautiously and overachieving drastically, I believe the company has plenty of room to outperform in 2018.The best play from here on out would be to wait as Zillow's shares consolidate in the low $40s and build a position into the recovery. With a current market cap of just $5.6 billion, Zillow's equity value alone (not counting its net cash position) is trading at just over 4x forward revenues, a cheap multiple for a stock with 92% gross margins atop double-digit growth."
4050536,102398,2017-02-28T13:22:56-05:00,Real estate market advertising has a different market structure in Australia and the USA.Zillow is richly valued with a much smaller market opportunity than flagged.Zillow suffers from poor profitability and increasing competition.,"A respected Sydney hedge fund called Caledonia has gone all in (""Zillow is Caledonia's biggest ever bet"") on Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), owning 21% of the stock, worth US$1.3 billion. They convinced James Packer to buy 9.33%, but mercifully he has since sold this down. This is such a big portion of Caledonia's fund that they've carved some of it off into a separate vehicle, no doubt with fees and costs.There is a graveyard full of investors who have trashed multi-decade careers by going all-in on a single stock. Think Ackman and Valeant (VRX), Eddie Lampert and Sears (SHLD), Phil Falcone and Lightsquared, et cetera, et cetera.When you see this kind of punt you can be assured the manager is displaying all of the following:1. A deep lack of respect for the market2. Flagging creativity and a lack of new ideas - a decent professional should have more ideas than capital3. Total disregard for even basic risk managementMost importantly it represents:4. A deep misunderstanding of how the world works.Out world is complex (some might say chaotic) and so is business. The most stable firms are only a series of unfortunate events away from going bust. This happens all the time.Among other unknowables, the effects of competition are unforeseeable. Every single company (and every single one of us) is subject to fate, typically expressed in surprise disasters.For a Fund to put >30% of its capital into a single company invariably leads to disaster. This happens so regularly that it's a great telling point that the punter is about to experience a dose of bad luck.In this case, if Zillow - a US real estate advertising play - was so good, why is it owned by Australians?One answer is that the Australian real estate market structure supports a company like Zillow and the Aussies have extrapolated this in the US. Caledonia's reputation is formidable in the Australian market, enough for it to put Australia's richest man into a very weak stock.Caledonia is clearly holding a weak hand - its fund performance is fragile, highly dependent on the outcome of a single situation.But what about Zillow itself, what is the story here?I first thought this was a classic tech set-up of extreme valuation and exceptional growth. If the company executes, the company is cheap, if it fails, then the capital is lost. Such firms spend everything they can to get firm resolution either way.There is some serious delusion going on here. Caledonia states this is a $50 billion opportunity.Er... what? The entire advertising market for real estate in the US is a fraction of that.Facebook has revenues of US$27 billion across all industries. Where is this 50 billion for real estate advertising?Back to psychology: when someone takes an irresponsible position like this there is invariably a history of past success. The thesis has worked before, and the resulting gold rush associated such happy memories with the play that the manager literally falls in love with the next similar idea.In markets as in life, never swallow anything whole.In this case, I'll speculate that Caledonia's old flame is realestate.com.au.There are a handful of stocks in Australia that have gone stonkingly well over the past few years and built the careers of the managers who bet on them. Some of these have stalled recently. Realestate.com.au is one. Caledonia explained itself by pointing at realestate.com.au.Betting on a repeating principle is reasonable enough. The reason I bought Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2011 was that it became clear it was going to roll out its incredibly popular hardware around the world, and was cheap on historic earnings. (FYI, for the first time since I recently started selling Apple share).How would this copycat thesis cope in this situation if the structure of the market in the US and Australia is different? A quick look suggests this is precisely the case.In Australia houses are sold by auction. This means the seller spends a small fortune - tens of thousands of dollars - to advertise to as many actual buyers as they can.An extra person or two can have a huge impact on price at auction, so it's important to hit all the channels and advertise everywhere possible. Advertising must be broad and reach as many bidders as possible.In the US and most of the rest of the world the story is different. There are selling agents, but also buying agents. The agents for both sides find each other, negotiate a price and smooth out the whole process. All up this is a far better way to make a big purchase, and much less prone to error on the buyers side anyway.Zillow is unlikely to become the realestate.com.au of the USA because the US market does not incentivise heavy advertising by sellers to reach every possible buyer. Advertising must only reach a handful of buyers' agents.A different game. Much smaller.In many ways this is a superior purchasing experience than in Australia. Our auctions involve value destroying advertising spend and the vagaries of the auction hammer. If anything, we are likely to become more like the US rather than the other way around.There are other red flags:Run for employeesVery roughly Zillow makes US$100 million in annualised operating cash flow, but pays this all out to its employees in stock-based compensation. Any stall would result in a death spiral of increasing share payouts, while after a few years such stock-based compensation would take the edge off any upside.Trading multiplesOn the valuation side, upside is fully baked in. Even if you go all the way out to 2019 the company is trading on an after-tax earnings multiple of 34.8x, or under 3% return. This is a poor return for the risk.Source: CapitalIQGrowth is also nothing spectacular. Tech companies on these multiples are typically growing far faster than 20%:Source: CapitalIQLack of core profitabilityThe following charts are from an excellent recent Seeking Alpha article.To summarize:The market structure thesis suggests Zillow should have lower core profitability than competitors. We would predict that Zillow has a lower EBITDA margin than realestate.com (REA) and UK competitors like Rightmove (OTCPK:RTMVY). This is indeed playing out:Zillow is in fact barely profitable at the EBITDA level.Tech companies are rightly prized for their scalability. Revenues should rise faster than expenses, which after sufficient growth leads to the incredible gross margins of technology companies.Zillow also does not appear to be achieving any economies of scale. If anything, costs are increasing far faster than revenues:Quarterly revenue growth has slowed down substantially. This is hidden in Zillow's annual results, but 1.3% is a very modest outcome. There are many value stocks that are growing far faster than this. There also seems to be a clear loss of momentum.I'd expect the buyers' and sellers' agents so common in the USA to have substantially more pricing power than international competitors. This indeed shows up in the data:Finally, the US market structure thesis would suggest that there is much less advertising revenue on an absolute basis. Again we can see this quite evidently, with Australian websites run by REA and the Domain achieving far higher revenues per person in each country.CompetitionIn the UK, there is intense competition between websites that try to disaggregate agents and the agents themselves who fight back. There is a great Citron article about how this is playing out in the US, where the same dynamic is taking place. It's located here, in its usual lemony style.Zillow has made a bit of a coup by buying the number 2 in the market, Trulia. However, given there are many existing competitors and multiple players who could set up competing advertising markets, the combined group is unlikely to maintain any pricing power.I've had some luck shorting these things before - Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Valeant in particular. Five years ago I would have made this a 10% or 20% position. But the market is a harsh mistress and I will certainly not put on a Caledonia-style punt.Who knows what's going to happen?Mike"
4045577,102051,2017-02-13T23:18:29-05:00,Zillow recently announced its 2016 results in line to above expectations.Zillow updated their 2017 strategies and guidance with a forecast to cross $1B revenue this year.Investors are less excited about the continued lack of profitability and declining revenue growth rates.,"Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) (NASDAQ:ZG) is a classic tech growth company financially with great revenue growth that is only matched by their spending and legal fees. They have recently provided their 2016 results and 2017 guidance, and I want to refresh my analysis from six months ago, which I provided here. While I recommend reading the whole thing for a more detailed dive into their revenue generation sections, the conclusion was that they were priced fair to high, and would need to be a long-term growth play to be worth a position in your portfolio.Business UpdatesZillow has made several business model updates since my last article. The first is to add a ""self-serve auction-based pricing platform for the Premier Agent Advertisers"" as described by the CEO Spencer Rascoff. This basically allows agents to bid for pieces of a zip code. More investment means a bigger slice of the leads.... until your competitors match your bid or exceed it. Mr. Rascoff gives a great example of how this plays out on their earnings call (found here):I am thrilled by this pricing model as it allows the market to set prices and removes Zillow from the risks of under/over pricing zip codes. There is risk in that a market downturn could cause pricing to plummet, but this risk exists regardless since Zillow would need to price incentives in during market downturns to minimize volume loss. Zillow does provide estimated ROI to agents by zip code as well to help them balance their spend as part of their agent interface software.Zillow also has a new ""emerging"" marketplace titled New Construction. This allows home builders to advertise their available lots and styles to the public. Similar to the real estate agent interfaces, Zillow also provides these companies with a detailed interface full of market information for the builders. They estimate this as a $1B total market.Business ResultsZillow ended 2016 with revenue growth of 31% at $847M. This follows a year where they nearly doubled revenue, so it is slower, but that was heavily based on acquisitions.Earnings came in at -$220M (-$1.22/share). Two items worth noting are a $130M litigation charge (labor pay dispute settlement) and a share-based compensation of $106M. Zillow is fond of using a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, which excludes share-based compensation. I generally disagree with this principle, as it is a cost to the shareholders to dilute them by an incremental 1.58% that would be paid to employees in cash if not in equity, but I share it for reference. It is worth noting though that the share-based compensation was steady YoY instead of growing as it had significantly in previous years.In terms of earnings growth, GAAP loss slowed its rate of growth at -40% YoY. Loss/share had nearly tripled for the previous 3 years based on costs of acquisitions, expenses, and legal fees. While legal fees are typically one-time expenses that is reasonable to exclude, it is worth mentioning that Zillow has had significant legal expenses repeatedly due to concerns over personnel and business acquisitions, technology ownership, and patent infringement. There are three pages in their 10-k for 2016 devoted to details of their cases in the last few years, the most that I have ever seen (here). This seems to be a theme that may continue to drive losses as there is another open case with VHT that started trial in January.Adjusted EBITDA fell due to the legal costs at $14M, an 84% drop YoY. If you exclude the legal settlement (+130M), it is 65% growth.Costs increased by 20% YoY, heavy on marketing and technology spend. This is in line with their strategy and less than the increase in revenue, showing mild restraint and operating margin improvement.To summarize 2016, revenue grew 31%, but ultimately led to -40% EPS based on legal issues and increased spending. Even including Zillow management's adjustments, EBITDA growth slowed showing a maturation of the business model. This places an irrelevant P/E or PEG and 7.4x P/S.Business OutlookZillow outlined four key strategies for 2017:Audience and engagement centers on driving user growth and engagement. User growth is primarily driven by marketing as well as reputation. The emerging marketplaces (i.e. NYC rental, new construction, etc.) also aid user growth, as it brings people to the Zillow family websites. Engagement centers on continued investment and development of the consumer interface.Premier Agent revenue growth centers on the rollout of the auction style lead management, revenue from the agent software services, and continued growth via share of total commissions (currently at ~5%). As they take share in this area, they should expect the auction-based pricing to drive ad dollars accordingly.Growing emerging marketplaces centers on the ""other"" categories at Zillow such as mortgage services, NYC focused sites, New Construction, etc. These experience disproportional growth based on their relatively small sizes individually and are expected to mature segments themselves. This seems to be a major expense area for research, development, and acquisition costs, but the growth rates partially justify it.Zillow's guidance for 2017 revenue was $1.03-1.05B. This was slightly below Wall Street estimates and represents a revenue growth of about 24%, a continued decline in the rate of growth percentage and almost exactly the same dollar value as 2016.Earnings guidance (adjusted) was for a 19% margin versus 17%, excluding the $130M charge in 2016. This would come from operating margin improvement and is still easily wiped out by the time it is translated to GAAP earnings. Their long-term goal is 40% EBITDA margin, but they don't appear to be in a hurry to get there. Several analysts leaned on the minimal margin, but Mr. Rascoff stood by a long-term focus and repeatedly rebuffed them for implying they should be working on margin sooner. To quote (source):From a risk perspective, Zillow is still tied to the real estate market. A crash in real estate (not unimaginable given rising interest rates) would lead to revenue risk as agents curtail spending during the downturn. Given their lack of profitability, this would risk needing to raise more capital and diluting shareholders.Zillow also still has competition from the likes of Realtor.com, which boasts a broader selection. This prevents them from significantly reducing their marketing spend lest they start to lose share.Finally, they do have further litigation hanging over their heads as they are currently in court for copyright infringement with VHT.ConclusionZillow's results and outlook disappointed most investors. Declining revenue growth rates, increasing losses, and continuing issues with litigation are hard to stomach and help explain the recent drop in share price. On the other hand, growth is still over 20% YoY, management has shown foresight in growing the business and investing in the right areas, and they are a market leader with only 5% of share leaving plenty of room to grow. In the end, I am still aligned (if a little more reservedly so) with my previous position on their value. The share price is valued at a premium for growth, so investors buying in now should expect at minimum a 3-5 year horizon before returns are meaningful. This provides a lot of time for the many risks to Zillow's business (real estate market crash, competitive activity, etc.) to come to fruition. This would be a good add for a speculative long position based on future potential if they continue to lead the market and can turn the corner on their expenses. For core portfolios looking for growth, look elsewhere."
4062307,102646,2017-04-13T13:54:43-04:00,Zillow is a market leader in the online real estate space.The company will cross the $1 billion revenue mark this year.Its losses are attributed to increased operating expenses which the management has started to reduce.,"Zillow (Z) (ZG) held its IPO in 2011, pricing its stock at $20. In the first day of trading, the stock went up by 120% to $44. Since then, the company has had an interesting ride. Its annual revenue has increased from $66 million to $846 million. It expects to cross the $1 billion mark this year. It has also managed to become the largest real estate platform with an average of 140 million unique monthly visitors. It has achieved this through various strategic acquisitions.Zillow Group is a market leader in online e-commerce marketing with a directory of more than 140 million homes listed across its platforms. The company operates the most popular real estate websites and apps in the United States. Its portfolio includes sites like Trulia, Hot Pads, Zillow, Street Easy, and Naked Apartment. It also owns other platforms like Dot Loop, Bridge Interactive, Retsly, and Mortech which help real estate professionals in different ways. The company makes 92% of its revenue through its marketplace services and the rest through display advertising.Most of Zillow's visitors access the company’s website directly, bypassing search engines and social media. The chart below shows the three-month unique traffic of Zillow and its brands compared with that of the closest competitors.Source: Similar WebZillow’s stock is currently trading at $34, giving it a market capitalization of $6.51 billion and an enterprise value of $6.1 billion. Its peak market cap was $7.2 billion in 2015. Its short interest is currently near its all-time low.In 2016, Zillow’s revenues increased to $844 million from $644 million in the previous year. Its net loss increased from $148 million to $220 million. The increase was attributed to a one-off charge of $130 million relating to a past lawsuit from Move Inc. which owns Realtor.com. Therefore, without the one-off charge, the company’s net loss decreased to $72 million. The company’s losses are attributed to its increased operating expenses which have moved from $195 million in 2013 to $967 million in 2016.There have been concerns about Zillow’s future growth. As mentioned, the company operates in the online real estate niche which is very different from other fields. This is because the frequency of people moving from one house to another is significantly lower. In addition, Zillow does not make money for every sale made by the agents. Instead, it charges agents a listing fee. Ideally, a slight commission on each sale would make the company more money depending on the number and value of the houses sold or let. This option, however, is not popular among real estate agents.In 2016, through the Premier Agent program, Zillow generated 17 million leads, making agents approximately $4.4 billion. This was significantly higher than the 12 million leads and $3.2 billion in commissions the company generated for agents in the previous year. This is the number that investors should pay close attention to because agents will always pay using their Premier Agent option if they are seeing results for their money.In terms of user growth, Zillow has done a commendable job. According to ComScore (NASDAQ:SCOR), the company is one of the top 50 multi-platform properties in the United States. It’s the only online real estate platform in the list. It is estimated that Zillow Group has a 70% market share in this space. However, maintaining this market share is expensive. The table below shows the increase in expenses in the past five years.Source: 10KAs you can see, the company’s sales and marketing expenses have risen considerably. In 2016, the percentage of sales and marketing to total revenue was 45%. However, this percentage is lower than the previous two years. The main reason why Zillow’s spend on sales and marketing cost is high is that the company depends on sales executives who market the Premier Agent portal to agents. Marketing using salespeople is relatively expensive because of the perks that come with it like share-based compensation.The company’s general and administration expenses have also risen considerably. The percentage of G&A expenses to total revenue has increased from 20% in 2014 to 37% in 2016. Although this includes the $130 million settlement, the remaining percentage is still high for a company that should not have a huge overhead. Similarly, the percentage of technology and development costs to revenue has increased from 26% in 2014 to 32% in 2016.Spencer Rascoff, the company’s CEO justifies the increased spending by saying:Although the company intends to reduce its G&A expenses this year, it will increase its marketing expenditure across the five consumer brands, business brands, and its marketplaces. G&A expenses will be slashed because the company has concluded integrating Trulia to its platform. The company will also reduce technology and development costs this year.At this price, Zillow is a good investment for patient investors. This year, the company expects its EBITDA to increase from $14 million to between $190 million and $210 million. Although the company will increase its marketing expenses, management has also committed to reduce expenses which they incurred in the previous year. Finally, investors should not forget Zillow’s brand value. Although the level of competition is growing, the company has managed to increase its market share by acquiring quality companies at reasonable valuations."
4042716,102704,2017-02-05T02:43:14-05:00,"Zillow exceeds revenue estimates in the last quarter.
        Still grappling with pricing on Zestimate.
        A short position likely to pay out in the long run.","Investment ThesisZillow posted good performance in the last quarter. But underneath the tidy profits, it seems to be valued at a higher price than how it really is.Zillow Group Inc.(NASDAQ: Z) is a Seattle-based media company that sells advertising space primarily to real estate estates agents and companies. Founded in 2006 by former Microsoft Execs, it generates revenue by lending ad space to other websites. It has since grown to be the largest provider of online real estate listing services in the US, recording more than 164 monthly unique visitors. Between 2011 and 2016, Zillow undertook acquisitions to grow its portfolio which includes Trulia, Zillow, StreetEasy, Naked Apartments, HotPads, Mortech, Retsly, Dotloop and Bridge Interactive. The acquisition of diverse platforms was strategic in that it could allow Zillow to build a wider user base without changing the features of existing platforms. Zillow also offers services to the rental market, as well as mortgage services for borrowers through the Zillow Mortgage Marketplace.State of the IndustryToday, it estimated that more than 80% of Americans have online access. Changing consumer patterns to the digitized world have left businesses little choice but to go online in search of more consumers and profits. Physically searching for a home for purchase or to let is a fairly tiresome process, both for agents and prospective home owners. The internet has simplified this by bringing an endless catalogue of homes to a computer or phone, and buyers can choose whether to supplement their search using an agent.Zillow's business model has taken advantage of the gap by giving a platform for both buyers and sellers to meet and transact, at a price. It does this by selling advertising services through its countrywide network of brokers, real estate professionals, contractors, rental brokers and mortgage brokers.Financial OutlookZillow is at a market cap of $6.37 billion, with shares trading at $35.35 apiece.In the Q3 2016 earnings call, Zillow's financials showed that it has outperformed expectations by most, if not all metrics. YoY revenue grew 35% to $225 million, exceeding the higher guidance. This growth was attributed to strong results from Marketplaces and prudent spending on expenses. Zillow's growth was strong across all segments, particularly in audience reach- the second quarter recorded a growth in unique visitors to 168 million on both web and mobile.The Premier Agent recorded revenue growth of 33% YoY to $158.3 million. PA is a software that gives real estate agents a platform to generate and organize leads in one place. In Q3, PA saw 4.6 million leads, in a 40% YoY increase. PA has also linked with Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) through the Premier Agent Direct Program to reach more audience through social media. In my analysis, a company that makes inroads into social media gains an advantage of free marketing through referrals. Also, a presence on Facebook will give Zillow a head-start in tapping young millennials.Despite these positives, Zillow still faces challenge when it comes to Zestimate, its most recognized feature. Zestimates is the home valuation feature through which users can get price estimates for homes according to location. Complains abound that Zestimate has a high margin of error, with buyers paying much more than what is displayed. Also, Zestimate fails to include the quality of a home such as the aesthetics or renovations done, giving a uniform price for houses in one area. However, an upgrade was done to reduce the margin of error from 8% to 6%.ConclusionI have mixed feelings towards this stock; its business model and portfolio are impressive and reassuring to investors, but the figures on paper do not quite do that. In this, I will use Zillow's competitors- The RMR Group Inc. (NASDAQ: RMR), Realogy Holdings (NYSE: RLGY), Jones Lang Lasalle Inc. (NYSE: JLL).Zillow's trailing PS ratio is 8.241, compared to RMR's 2.836, RLGY's 0.6554 and JLL's 0.7343. I take this as one sign of an overvalued company. Further, on profitability, Zillow posted EBITDA of -15.64%, against 55.62%, 8.03% and 9.98% for RMR, RLGY and JLL respectively. The estimates do not seem to help much, too. The estimated forward PE ratio of Zillow is 43.13, compared to 26.28, 15.01 and 12.64 for RMR, RLGY and JLL in that order. Going by these numbers, my take is that at $35.35, Zillow is trading at a price way above its true value. I therefore will call a short position on this stock."
4034247,102436,2017-01-04T11:35:30-05:00,Why Zillow Group won't make money in the foreseeable future.What Zillow's own reports show.What is the best case scenario for Zillow's stock?,"For some companies, Wall St. serves as a source of capital to fund the company's operations until reaching profitability. For other companies, like Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), Wall St. serves as a charity fund to pay for bonus packages, employee salaries, and high priced acquisitions for a money losing machine.Being short most of the time is the hardest job on earth. Your articles will be attacked viciously in the commentary section, and you will have less followers and more haters. But that doesn't prevent Celeritas Investments from exposing the truth in this article; the one that proves that Zillow Group's stock is barely worth half its current value.The problem with Zillow Group is that the company is operating in a competitive, capital intensive, price sensitive market. However, with the Trulia acquisition, things might get a little bit better with respect to more pricing power, but still not enough.One of Zillow's biggest threat to its current market valuation is the company's (and most companies in the industry) limited ability to make money. This can be clearly seen when a company that is more than 10 years old, posts a silly ""record"" profit with a 3% margin.When investors think of buying Z, they should know that they are exposing themselves to a company valued at $6,600 million, while generating a ""record"" of $6.8 million after 10 years of burning money (and that's only for Q3, if you take TTM, the company poised a loss of $222 million). Don't forget that that is done with all the synergies achieved after the Trulia acquisition, the ones that Zillow's CEO Spencer Rascoff told that they are "" significant"" two years ago.I noticed that some SA commentators have used the notion that ""Zillow is the next Amazon"" when defending the company's un-profitability. And that the company should focus on revenue now and should worry about profitability later. Well, it's far from that.The two companies are operating in a totally different environment.Amazon invested (and still investing) its revenues in building warehouses and fulfillment centers across the globe, which is a major element in providing long term profitability for the company.However, Zillow is investing most its proceeds in its unstable, short-term customer base. And that is a confession made by Zillow itself (Source 2015 10k).Zillow knows how unstable its customer base is, and it knows that it can't make a profit due to its fragile business model. Also, that is a confession made by Zillow itself (Source 2015 10k).""May not be able to generate sufficient revenue to be profitable over the long term"", really? Is this a corporation or a charitable foundation?""Our revenue growth rate may decline"". The company's valuation is based on nothing EXCEPT revenue growth (the stock's P/S ratio is more than 8). So, if revenue declines, on what basis should the company be valued?Value the company on earnings?If we do, Zillow's value will be null. That's because Zillow won't be able to generate profits at least in the medium term, why? Because for Zillow to get $1 in revenue, it should spend $0.87 in SG&A expenses.And that is not a near term issue. The problem of high operational costs, mainly selling and marketing expenses which contributes for $0.73 of cost for every $1 of revenue, has been with Zillow since 2010.And that is a confession made by the most trustful source, Zillow.When you say implicitly ""I'm nasty"", it means you are really really nasty.So, how profitability can ever come if management itself expects that revenue may decline and its already high-costs will increase?In addition, does anyone think, as I do, that this is one of the creepiest risk factors in a company to be mentioned in its annual report? Take a look.Really? I've read hundreds of 10k reports and didn't see anything like this (correct me if I'm wrong). I've seen that ""if some analysts downgraded our stock, the stock price could be negatively impacted"". But, ""if few or no analysts cover""? So, the company knows that its stock price is based on just a lala land story of profitability that analysts tell.This story is based around Zillow being the leader of the real estate web services industry. And we all know it is. But what that means to valuation?Let's be generous and assume that it will be valued as Priceline (PCLN), the leader in the traveling web services industry.In addition, let's give Zillow the benefit of the doubt and assume that its revenues will increase by 30%.I will also assume that it will become profitable, with the same as Priceline's profit margins and P/E ratio, which is 14% and 38 respectively.Thus, with a revenue of $946 million and a net income of $132, Zillows' market cap will be at $5 billion (!), 25% lower from current levels. And that is done by giving a $132 million profit for a company that for 10 years its ""record"" was $6 million in quarterly profits. And don't forget that its high selling and marketing expenses accompanied with its unstable customer base, and high competition from MLS, will put huge pressures on its margins, making a 14% profit margin look like a dream.Concluding, Zillow is having huge problems given its business structure. Its problems are not company-specific, but industry-specific. However, it is the only big-public gamer in town. The biggest 3 companies with 48% market share is Zillow, Realtor.com, and Trulia. Realtor.com is under the umbrella of News Corp., while Trulia was acquired by Zillow. This leaves us with Zillow as the biggest public company with the highest valuation. I believe that Zillow's stock will suffer from a significant decrease in its price sooner or later. The investment community is currently valuing the company based on its impressive revenue growth, but when revenue growth slows down and investors start focusing on earnings, the stock price will reflect the real fundamentals of the company.As Andrew Left says: Cautious investing to all."

In fact, despite some moderate moves in the right direction, current weakness in this area has done nothing to help jump start GDP back into truly expansionary territory. The arguments of the why and how of trends in housing are complex (and more suited to a separate discussion), but there are signs of thawing in what has been a tepid expansion out of the recession. Broadly, housing starts are on the rise, millennial interest in becoming homeowners is on the mend, household formation is up, and mortgage interest rates are back down to record lows. There are certainly concerns (consumer debt, labor participation), but overall, trends look favorable to me. There are deals to be had across the industry, but traditionally these fall in goods-producers (such as a favored position of mine, USG Corporation (NYSE:USG)) and not technology companies.Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) (NASDAQ:ZG), however, is a technology that is fundamentally impacted by shifts in the housing space. The real estate business seems stuck in the old world of 3-6% commissions here in the United States despite significant change elsewhere globally when it comes to fees. Fellow Seeking Alpha Contributor Daniel Carlson hit the nail on the head recently in his own Zillow publication, and I echo his macroeconomic and secular sentiments regarding the industry. While I don't think things will change overnight, technology will force some change one way or another - it always does. As a consolidator in the space after scooping up Trulia early in 2015, there simply isn't much competition for Zillow when it comes to the online real estate market. First-mover advantage is very real in technology, and that is why the market has given Zillow a multi-billion-dollar valuation with not much to show for in profits.When Will Zillow Make Money?At the end of the day, it is important to remember why we invest in the first place. To me, the reason for investing is simple, and what you'll find in any economics textbook. Investors lend capital to companies that need it to invest in development and expansion. In return for those funds, we nab a portion of the business. Why own a business? A share of the profits of course - either current or future. If a business never makes profit (generates a return on capital you have lent), there is simply no reason for you to lend.Despite an amazingly fragmented and large addressable market, Zillow has seen a steady acceleration of GAAP net income losses - not gains - over the past several years. This is despite strong revenue growth and continued adaptation by increasingly technology-savvy consumers and realtors (perhaps grudgingly).These increases all come down to legal and acquisition/restructuring costs primarily. Investors who have paid attention to cash flows and not earnings per share would have noticed positive operational cash flow for years because of the large amount of non-cash expenses, which is why cash burn hasn't been as much of a problem as one might think looking at the company's results. Excluding these legal costs, the picture is much clearer. So yes, GAAP losses did grow to $150M in 2015 from $75M a year prior, but that can be chalked up to:- $35.6M in restructuring costs- $16.6M in acquisition costs- $27.1M in legal costs associated with Move, Inc. lawsuitHeading into the rest of 2016, restructuring costs should be minimal. The company booked none in Q1 2016, and the TTM rate is just $10M. These costs should largely be behind the company. Likewise, acquisition costs are dropping, with 2015 booking of $16.6M well below 2014 levels of $25M; expect less than $10M in total acquisition costs in 2016. This by itself is a $40M net benefit to the company's margins.Unfortunately, investors will have to wait for 2017 to see a less cloudy GAAP results picture. Zillow has agreed to settle the Move, Inc. lawsuit for $130M after receiving some unfavorable rulings on evidence earlier in the year. GAAP loss in the $200M range should be expected this year given the likely timing of the settlement, but the company should swing to positive GAAP earnings in 2017. Luckily for investors, Zillow has plenty of cash on hand to settle the issue without going to the bond markets or issuing more equity.Revenue is set to finally eclipse the $1B mark in 2017. With some moderate operating leverage on the SG&A front (contraction towards SG&A/revenue of 65% from 75% in 2015), the company should eke out a mild GAAP net income profit of $30M (assumes no tax expense given net operating losses), or something in the neighborhood of $0.17/share. This estimate is in line with the high side of current non-GAAP estimates by the Street (consensus $0.53/share), given the usual $110M in stock-based compensation expense ($0.62/share) that gets excluded from non-GAAP calculations. The Street is being a little more cautious on operating leverage contraction rolling into 2017 given the relative lack of execution in prior years, and I think that does present an opportunity for Zillow (and for Zillow longs) to beat on expectations and hopefully wiggle out a little bit of upside from current prices.With all that said, there is a long way from breakeven earnings per share and justifying a multi-billion-dollar equity valuation. Concerns continue to linger on how large the actual addressable market is for Zillow, and how to reconcile a begrudgingly paying user base (realtors) with the longevity of the business model. Despite being the obvious market leader, the company continues to spend a heck of a lot of money on selling and advertising its products. Without meaningful operating leverage - which the company has not yet proven is possible or maintainable - Zillow is simply a company with a great idea that can't monetize effectively.For more research like this on small/mid cap companies perpetually under-followed by Wall Street and under-owned by retail investors, consider following me (by clicking the ""Follow"" button at the top of this article next to my name) to receive notification when I publish research.

3436356,50792,2015-08-13T10:42:08-04:00,Stronghold on the online real estate market and the network effect means Zillow will ultimately have a competitive edge over any potential competitors.Revenue has been surging over the past two quarters and is likely to continue to expand.Unique users visiting Zillow brands are growing with each quarter and will continue to grow in the quarters ahead.I Know First algorithm is bullish on Zillow over the long-term time horizon.,"Zillow Group (NASDAQ:Z) is the leading online real estate portal in the United States and reinforced their market leadership through the purchase of their then main competitor Trulia back in July last year. However, due to a variety of factors, mainly continuous negative net income and profit margins, Zillow shares has steadily dropped in value by over thirty percent over the past six months alone. But, based on its most recent quarterly results, I Know First Research is now bullish on Zillow stock.Shift in Revenue Source Contributes to Record RevenuesRecent quarterly results show Zillow accruing revenues of over $170m - an increase of over 33% from the $127m of revenues earned in the previous quarter - and year on year growth of nearly 120%.(Figure 1: capitalcube.com)The two key sources that contribute to Zillow's revenue is display revenue (chiefly advertisements) and marketplace revenue - which consists of real estate revenue, mortgages revenue and market leader revenue. Both streams of revenue have always performed consistently well but display revenue has notably decreased by 15% compared to second quarter of 2015 thus illustrating the manner in which marketplace revenue is slowly becoming the main source of Zillow's total revenue.Historically, the real estate market has been highly fragmented and solidly local. Consumers by and large had restricted access to information and were heavily reliant on the advice of local real estate agents and brokers in attempting to enter the property market. Zillow is in the process of successfully changing that. Their online portal allows anybody and everybody to access all aspects of the property market and all the amount of information one would need and Zillow's fantastic revenue growth is testament to the fantastic service the company offers to consumers.Market place revenue is the more profitable of the two streams and the shift from display revenue bodes well for the long-term prospects of the company and the stock. If revenue continues to grow at current rates, then huge chunks of free cash flow will inevitably follow, and long-term shareholders will be rewarded.Unique Users Continue to GrowApproximately 141 million average monthly unique visitors visited Zillow Group's consumer brands, Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy and HotPads in the second quarter, and, according to comScore, Zillow Group brands now represent a 72% market share of all mobile unique visitors to the real estate category.Zillow has cleverly designed their company based on the network effect. Essentially, sellers will advertise their product where it will be viewed by the largest number of potential buyers and buyers will go to the marketplace where there is the largest amount of products available. After a lot of buyers and sellers assemble in one place, more of each will continue to congregate there which consequently creates a tight-knit cycle making it harder for competitors to break into the market.Online real estate portals have little barriers to entry and therefore, inevitably, a competitor will emerge. But since Zillow already has a deep-seated online market for the real estate sector, their reputation and their traditional customer pool will hand Zillow a competitive edge.Low Share PriceWithin the last year, Zillow's share price has dropped from over $150 to below the $80 dollars it is worth today. Negative net incomes, negative profit margins and the departure of the CFO have all contributed to the plunge of Zillow stock and, realistically, the company will remain unprofitable in the near future.(Figure 2: Yahoo!Finance)However, Zillow's fantastic revenue returns and constant growth of unique visitors with each passing quarter almost guarantees that Zillow will become profitable in the long-term.ConclusionAlthough Zillow shares have been on a continuous downward spiral over the past year, the fact that Zillow's revenues and customer base continues to grow means that Zillow will eventually become profitable. Likewise, the lack of serious competition Zillow has in this growing market bodes well for both Zillow stock and their investors.At I Know First we use genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks to study financial markets in order to breakdown the flow of money between stocks, commodities and currencies. Our current algorithmic forecastfor Zillow indicates a strong bullish outlook based on a signal strength of 243 over the one year period.

Just take a look at Yelp.Zillow completed its largest acquisition earlier this year, buying competitor Trulia for $3.5 billion in stock that’s worth a lot less these days.","Jeffrey Alton, CFACompany DescriptionZillow Group (NASDAQ:Z) is the umbrella company over a portfolio of real estate brands on the web covering everything from its flagship Zillow site for new home sales to other web sites for rentals, mortgages and home furnishings. Zillow completed its largest acquisition earlier this year, buying competitor Trulia for $3.5 billion in stock that's worth a lot less these days.Zillow divides its revenues into two main categories. The first is marketplace revenue which is derived from real estate professionals, including advertising for lead generation and a suite of tools for brokers such as Zillow site performance analytics and customer relationship management tools. Real estate agents purchasing Zillow's premier platinum product are highlighted as featured agents for listings in a given zip code. The second revenue category is advertising on the site. Advertising clients may be real estate professionals, but also include home builders, mortgage lenders, telecommunications companies, etc. Prior to the Trulia acquisition, Zillow revenue trends are:These trends continue: Zillow experienced strong growth in the first quarter of 2015. Total revenue was $127.3 million, including Trulia's contribution in the second half of the quarter when the acquisition was finally completed. Marketplace revenue in the first quarter was a strong $109 million. Display revenue was $18.3 million.What is to Love.....What is behind Zillow's growth? The company has continued to expand its reach to real estate agent subscribers, and, once those agents become customers, they have steadily increased their spending on Zillow over time. While the law of larger numbers is beginning to kick in, Zillow still put up a strong 29% growth rate in agents using the service and 27% growth rate in average account billings in 2014.After including Trulia, agent clients totaled 103,000 at the end of the first quarter and average monthly revenue per advertiser grew to $354 by the end of the first quarter 2015. Results were particularly strong for advertisers using Zillow more than one year, increasing spending by 50%.Zillow has also been successful in increasing direct feeds from Multiple Listing Services (MLS). Zillow receives direct listings feeds every few minutes from 235 MLSs, including 105 new MLSs that joined in a six week period after the end of the first quarter. The direct feeds improve Zillow's listings quality which contribute to audience growth and provide more ad impressions.What's Not to Love....With a blistering growth rate and a recovering housing market as a tailwind, what's not to love about Zillow? The first is swelling expenses dwarfing revenue growth and resulting in accelerating net losses. In addition to a net loss of $58 million on revenues of $127 million in the first quarter of 2015. Zillow had losses of $43.6 million in 2014 and $12.5 million in 2013. EBITDA has also been a negative $55 million over the last twelve months, though adjusted for share-based compensation and restructuring costs gets the company to a positive adjusted EBITDA.Channeling its inner Amazon, management is steadfast in investing for the future, despite short-term red- ink. Don't expect that mindset to change. Zillow Co-founders Rich Barton and Lloyd Frink own Class B shares with super voting rights of 10 votes per share, giving them majority control of the company. That majority was further entrenched last month when the company announced it would issue Class C shares to all Class A and Class B shareholders on a one-to-one basis. Class C shares have no voting rights, are the shares quoted under the ""Z"" stock symbol and will be the class issued in the future to fund any company expansion.Another management question arose when CFO Chad Cohen announced his resignation early in July. In a sanitized press release, Mr. Cohen was thanked for his service as the company began searching for a new CFO. Not even a line about wanting to spend more time with the family. Some have cited the protracted and underwhelming way the Trulia acquisition was handled as a reason for the departure. While not devastating, Mr. Cohen's resignation does leave one with an uneasy feeling about management in the short-term. Some may not find it encouraging or even credible that CEO Spencer Rascoff recently said in the press release detailing the stock dividend, ""Our Board, management and the shareholders who have chosen to invest in Zillow, view the company in terms of decades, not quarters or years.""Investors should also be aware of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp ""moving"" into the online real estate space. In December 2014, News Corp bought competitor Move.com which operates a number of real estate sites including realtor.com - the official site of the National Association of Realtors. Zillow has 140 million monthly users versus Move.com's 30 million per month, but News Corp's financial assets and distribution should not be discounted.Valuation is another consideration for investors. Though the stock price has basically been cut in half over the last 12 months, it still trades at a steep 7 times 2015 projected sales of $666 million. Consensus estimates are for a loss this year, but a profit of $1.50/share in 2016. That puts the stock at a 2016 p/e of about 55 times. Priced to perfection, but not completely off the charts when it comes to fast growing internet companies. Any miss in estimates, however, means further swift punishment for investors and therein lies the low HOCS safety score.ConclusionsThe easiest thing to say about Zillow securities is that they should continue to be volatile. Zillow sits in an industry with the wind at its back (or at least a breeze), but faces continued steep expectations. The 2016 $1.50/share consensus earnings estimate seems particularly ripe for disappointment in our view after years of heavy losses. That volatility bodes well for convertible arbs looking to short the stock, especially given the absence of a dividend, if they can get their hands on any. Borrowing can be difficult and is reportedly getting quite expensive (we are hearing 9-10%) in front of the recapitalization. Cynics might wonder if that wasn't part of the company's strategy when the shares appeared to be in free-fall.Longer-term investors should be more attentive to the HOCS safety score and perhaps wait until after earnings before making any bets. (Some may object to the word ""bet"" as it relates to investing, but what else can you call buying shares or their equivalents the day before an earnings report?)While significant debate continues at Hillside over the quality of Zillow management, real estate bulls probably want to own Zillow to round out their portfolio. Zillow recently acquired DotLoop, an electronic signatures company for brokers, so growth in tangential areas to listings does exist. The convertible notes, while trading at a 20% premium to the stock, offer a more conservative way to invest, guarding against a sharp decline in the equity should Zillow fail to deliver. The bond includes a soft call (triggered with parity at 130) after December 2018 which could potentially cap gains if the equity can start working its way back, although more than three years can be an eternity for names like this even though Mr. Rascoff tells us the world sees the company in terms of decades. On the other hand, the company's strong liquidity position should support the convert through volatile times.A quick refresher. HOCS, or Hillside Overall Convertible Score, measures the attractiveness of a bond, taking into account both upside potential and downside protection. HOCS is not a theoretical model but a rating system that assigns points to a number of different characteristics of each convertible. HOCS can theoretically lie anywhere from 0 to 100. In practice the average score for a broad group of convertibles is typically around 50. 60 is a good score, 70 is excellent, and 80 is exceptional."
3676166,22148,2015-11-11T12:10:03-05:00,"Zillow appears headed toward previous seasonal trading trends.The merger integration issues and business unit exits are nearly over, providing a cleaner view going forward.The stock is predicted to bottom some time in mid-December to get the normal trends back on course.","The past story with Zillow Group (NASDAQ:Z) (NASDAQ:ZG) was the amazing seasonality of the stock. Without fail, the stock would rise and fall with the seasonal trends of real estate sales and MUUs on their owned websites and apps.The merger with Trulia and the difficulties of the integration messed up the seasonal trends of the business last year. Zillow produced highly disappointing results leaving the stock trading substantially below the $50 highs when the merger was announced over a year ago. With the stock heading towards multi-year lows, will the trend become an investors friend again?Disruptive NumbersThe biggest problem with seasonality trends of the past is that Zillow decided to de-emphasize two business lines that contributed to substantially lower growth rates in the near term. In the latest quarter alone, Market Leader revenue declined 29% to $11.0 million and display revenue decreased 23% to $23.5 million. The two business units combined for revenue of $45.9 million last year were mistimed to occur with a merger.The key real estate and mortgage revenues growth rates were solid suggesting a bright future. The largest bucket that is the real estate revenue grew 27% to $129.7 million.With the Market Leader sold at the end of September, the $11.0 million of Q3 revenue will disappear in Q4. The total Q3 revenue growth of 13% is not impressive to analysts already forecasting that Zillow will struggle to match original total addressable market size targets.The bottom line is that some of the benefits of the merger were highly impacted and delayed due to the exit of the business lines. Sure removing display ads will help the presentation on mobile apps, but investors weren't planning a big revenue line to disappear.SeasonalityIf investors can finally get past the disruptive moves by the company of merging with Trulia and closing revenue lines, the seasonal pattern has the possibility of returning.In the past, Zillow had a tradition of peaking during September as the seasonal real estate selling season ends. The stock would hit a low in November and early December when the MUUs would bottom and rebound dramatically into the Spring selling season.The Q3 results showed some of the normal seasonal patterns with Zillow reporting a seasonal peak of 150 million MUUs in July and an average for the quarter of 142 million MUUs. Clearly, the users were starting to trail off as the quarter ended. The stock though peaked in early October due to general weakness in the stock during the Summer this year. The peak wasn't far off the past trend. The stock is already down over 20% from that peak only a month ago.If the trend is back on path, Zillow has seen trough prices on the following dates as highlighted in the below chart:TakeawayThe key takeaway is that Zillow appears back on path for seasonal stock moves. With the timing still slightly off from the merger integration issues, the recommendation is to late the stock decline further into December before playing the previous trends. The typical declines were roughly two months long.Ultimately, Zillow appears primed for a strong 2016 as revenues rebound and the exited business units no longer impact the financials."
3433116,20521,2015-08-12T13:34:08-04:00,,"The online realty sector has seen significant consolidation over the past year with Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) acquiring Trulia and Move acquired by News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWS) (NASDAQ:NWSA). With the Trulia acquisition running into delays over an antitrust violation probe, Zillow looked gloomy. The company recently recorded a better-than expected quarter and encouraging progress on the Trulia integration.Zillow's FinancialsZillow's second quarter revenues grew 20% over the year to $171.3 million, $2.58 million ahead of the Street estimate. GAAP net loss was $38.7 million compared to $97.1 million last year. The loss includes the impact of $1.7 million of acquisition-related costs and $6.7 million of restructuring costs due to the company's 2.5 billion acquisition of Trulia. Non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.01, beating the street estimate by $0.25. Adjusted EBITDA was $21 million or 12% of revenue, $17 million higher than the second quarter 2015 outlook.By segment, marketplace revenues grew 29% to $145.5 million and mortgage display advertising revenues declined 15% to $25.8 million as a result of their strategy to shift their focus to their more promising agent advertising business.Their highest spending agent advertisers have been buying more impressions to expand their presence on their platform. As a result, the annualized run rate for their agent advertising business increased 30.6% over the year to $456 million. ARPA was $375 per agent advertisers, increasing 18% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. They ended the quarter with an agent advertiser count of 101,297, up 11% year-over-year.During the second quarter, 141 million average monthly unique users visited Zillow Group consumer brands Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy and HotPads. Citing comScore data, the company says its Zillow Group brands now represent nearly 50% of all category visits and 72% of all mobile exclusive visitors to the category.For the third quarter, Zillow expects pro forma revenue in the range of $175 million to $177 million. Analysts were expecting slightly higher revenue of $180.9 million.For full-year 2015, Zillow reaffirmed its pro forma revenue guidance of $690 million and raised its pro forma EBITDA outlook to a range of $85 million to $90 million. Analysts were expecting revenue of $666.5 million and a net loss of $0.05 per share.Acquisitions and Management ChangesZillow Group last month announced the planned acquisition of DotLoop, a Cincinnati-based company that simplifies real estate transactions by making it paperless. The acquisition aligns with the company's mission to provide value-add productivity tools and products to its partner brokers and their agents and is expected to close in the third quarter.Zillow also announced that it's appointing Kathleen Phillips as the new CFO after Chad Cohen resigned last month. Kathleen had served as the company's COO since 2013. Amy Bohutinsky, who has served as the chief marketing officer for the past four years, will be the new COO.Stiff Competition Adds to Zillow's WoesThe Trulia acquisition, which was announced in July 2014, was delayed considerably by the Federal Trade Commission investigating the deal for potential antitrust violations. This has brought down investor confidence and its stock.And to top it, its rival Move, which operates Realtor.com and ListHub, was acquired by News Corp. in November 2014. Zillow had to end its ListHub agreement in early April and there was a drop in the listings, but it soon recovered according to an analysis by Issi Romem, chief economist of BuildZoom. The company reported during the recent earnings call that more than 300 MLSs have signed up to add listings directly, having added 81 new MLS partnerships in the recent quarter.Last month, Barclays had downgraded Zillow for the second time in three months citing slowing traffic and increased competition from Realtor.com. In fact since its acquisition, Realtor.com's traffic overtook Trulia's for the first time. While Trulia is seeing flat growth, Zillow and Trulia together are growing well. In June, the number of unique visitors for Zillow and Trulia had increased 14% quarter-over-quarter to 86 million unique visitors while for the Realtor.com network, it had increased 4.3% q-o-q to 32.6 million unique visitors. While things might have looked gloomy for Zillow a couple of months back, it seems to be on the road to fixing its troubles.The stock is currently trading at a 52-week low of $72.82 with a market cap of $4.38 billion. It hit its 52-week high of $148.54 in July last year."
3371615,90645,2015-07-30T17:07:08-04:00,Current situation.Potential catalysts from within.How the landscape will change.Can Z overcome the obstacles?,"FANG? Try FANGZ.Have a question? Google it. Heard about a show? Netflix it. Interested in a house? Zillow it. There is something about today's culture that we enjoy making proper names into nouns. It is an idiosyncrasy in which the growth investor can profit enormously, because this language trend reflects the moat of a company in the minds of its users.Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) became the go-to for search and then monetized and expanded. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) became the go-to for on-demand entertainment, and then transitioned and created its own source of ""upstream production"" by creating original content. By continuously developing Google and Netflix have dominated their markets. Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) has cornered the marketplace for real estate advertising, an industry estimated at $13 billion by Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff.Past performance all but guarantees future returnsShareholders in the three previously mentioned companies have been generously rewarded for their investment in the past 5 years:Google's 5 year average annual return has been 31.6%, and Netflix has put up 45.4% per year (helped along by its staggering 125% increase YTD). Zillow, having just reached its 4 year anniversary of IPO, has increased at 29% per year. All three have greatly outperformed the S&P's 88% return in that timeframe. Well they should as they are all fantastic companies with growing revenues as well as exciting future prospects.Speaking about revenues, the Google and Netflix juggernauts have increased the money brought in by 125% and 150%, in the past five years. Zillow has increased their revenue in four years by almost 1000%. Another way to put it is that is more revenue growth in one year for Zillow than revenue growth (%) for Google and Netflix's last five years combined.These revenues show no real signs of slowing, as the housing market is really just beginning to rebound from fallout of the housing bubble. This is the first and most important catalyst to future earnings. A Bloomberg article speaks to this microeconomic tailwind for Zillow which is just beginning. Housing starts, an indicator which tracks new building permits issued, rose 9.8% from May to June. More homes means a broader market and user base for Zillow. The chief economist of the National Association of Realtors summed it up the rise in home starts this way: ""Home values are rising too fast and we need more supply to bring the price growth down, consistent with income growth.""The housing recovery is just now gaining real steam. A casual viewing of census.gov's Houses Sold by Region log shows first that the market is recovering, and second that we are a long way from the norm. Starting in 2011 one can see the annual houses sold rising from 306K to 368K to 429K to last year's 437K. Disregarding the home sales numbers directly after the housing crash, the last time this few houses were sold was in 1982. In 2003, long before the bubble's zenith, over a million houses were sold per year. Home sales have a long runway to even attain normalcy.In addition to this, interest rates are set to rise for the first time in 6 years by the end of this year. If anything will spur people to go out and buy homes, it's the fear that rates will rise before they can lock down a fantastic rate. 2016 should see an explosion of home buyers, as this becomes a more common trend of thought.Where's the Value?The first question is how Zillow makes money. Zillow's business model relies on partnerships with realtors for the majority of its revenue, with the rest coming from ads. It is very simple, the kind of business everyone can readily understand. That's the kind of business that I like to invest in.The realtor network partnership growth is exploding, while the display revenue is still growing swiftly though outstripped by the marketplace revenue. Z was able to build on brand recognition in order to move from ad revenue to the much larger realtor partnership model. Zillow's unaudited operating metrics clearly point to the transition from advertisement-based revenue to valuable partnerships. ""Marketplace revenue"" rose to 82% of total revenue in 2014, up from 78.3% in 2013 and 74% in 2012, and only 64% in 2011.Marketplace revenue is growing at an outstanding rate. From 2011-2012 it more than doubled, and in the past two years it has increased by more than 72% each year. In all of these years the housing market has been very slowly recovering, and with an inevitable housing recovery catalyst for the foreseeable future, marketplace revenue should continue to grow aggressively.Display revenue, while not a driver on the earnings as much as marketplace revenue, is still growing at a 35% annual clip. Advertisements will continue to be a source of stable revenue, as average monthly unique users was over 75 million in 2014.As will be mentioned, Zillow acquired Trulia soon a few months after this was posted (Oct. 21, 2014)...So what's the bad news?Investor sentiment has lagged this rapid increase of revenue, particularly in the last year. Z is down over 40% in that timeframe, as costs of incorporating Trulia into Zillow Group hit the balance sheet and the impact of ex-CFO Chad Cohen's resignation. I believe these two occurrences to be short-term drags on the stock price, and fantastic opportunities to buy on the pullback, as the incorporation of Trulia's business constitutes the second catalyst for Z.Z hasn't done so hot since announcing the Trulia acquisition plan.Zillow's $3.5 billion acquisition of Trulia was a monumental one. In acquiring the #2 player in the real estate advertising market, and added on Trulia's focus on renters. Zillow cut duplicate functions in sales and support in order to maximize acquisitive synergies. This is a very important consideration for a growth company; its speaks very well to the future prospects of a growth company when they prune costs as they are rapidly growing.This acquisition certainly has short term negatives on Zillow's balance sheet in fees (legal, accounting, regulatory filing, etc.), as well as Trulia's debt taken on by Zillow and dilution of shares in the share-for-share acquisition. The long term positives include business synergies, a greater market share, and an expected $100 million in annualized cost savings by 2016.Considering that Zillow paid a premium of 25% to Trulia's stock price, the $3.5 billion represents an $875 million premium for added value to Zillow (assuming investors had valued Trulia fairly). Zillow's investment will thus be paid for in less than 9 years in synergies alone (at the $100 million/year rate of savings). Although the price for Trulia was dear, the long term benefits of this acquisition seem to justify the expense. Spurred on by tailwinds in the real estate industry, the combined Zillow-Trulia marketplace will be in prime position to capitalize.Zillow has kept mum about Cohen's reasons for leaving, as he himself has, but there are too many considerations to try and play a guessing game. The financial picture is trending in the right direction, and with a lot of momentum. That is what matters.The last catalyst is an opportunity to receive share dividend in mid August. Class A and B shareholders will receive two shares of new non-voting ""Class C"" shares for every share they have. While many will be quick to point out this is just a dilution, it is one which will greatly benefit Class A shareholders compared to future investors. If there is a perfect time to invest in Z it is before August 14th.As a post-script to the catalysts, a hidden future opportunity might lie in Zillow's newest acquisition of DotLoop, a company that ""simplifies real estate transactions by enabling brokerages, real estate agents, and their clients to share, edit, sign and store documents digitally."" (Zillow Press release).According to Zillow, 500,000 people sign real estate documents on Dotloop per month. As compiling documents and organizing appointments to go into banks to sign terms is one of the most annoying things in the free world, DotLoop could spell a huge future profit center. This could be a gem of an acquisition for Zillow.ConclusionZillow is an aggressive growth company that will explode in stock price within the next year. Various factors lend credence to this claim, including market position, past earnings, and macroeconomic and microeconomic tailwinds, and synergies. The dividend of Class C shares round out the opportunity and make this the perfect time to act. Sun Trust analyst Bob Peck sure agrees: he calls for $130 PT and $685 million revenue for fiscal year 2015 (110% yoy increase). Next time you see a house for sale, don't just ""Zillow it,"" buy Z."
3358095,20335,2015-07-26T11:45:25-04:00,,"We have been skeptical of Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) for some time now. We first reported on the company in 2012, with frequent updates. Three years later, with no real profits to show and endless amounts of insider selling, plus round after round of lowered guidance, we believe that this sucker is finally ready to break, as the company has run out of tricks and finally has to show profits.The only question is how low will it go? We suggest that $40 is a fair starting point.That would afford Zillow a market cap of $2.5 billion and have it trade at a generous 4x 2015 revenue. Instead of going through a long boring report, and in honor of the retirement of David Letterman, we will present the: Top 10 Reasons Why Zillow is Going To Trade Below $40 In The Next Year1. Zillow is a lead generation company for real estate agents and mortgage brokers … nothing more.So it will ultimately trade like a lead generation company. Look at TrueCar (NASDAQ:TRUE), which now trades at 2.5x revenue or Bankrate (NYSE:RATE) which trades at 2x revenue. There are fixed multiples for these types of companies and Zillow should be grateful for the $40 target - which is still more than 4X its 2015 revenues.2. In what we believe is the “jump-the-shark” moment … the CEO wants investors to view the company in decades.In this week’s press release outlining a preferred stock split, CEO Rascoff states, “Our Board, management, and the shareholders who have chosen to invest in Zillow, view the company in terms of decades, not quarters or years.” We wonder: “Why not in centuries or millennia?”3. Despite wanting investors to wait for decades, the CEO is dumpingOver the past 12 months Rascoff himself has sold $13.7 million worth of stock. Guess his patience doesn’t run for decades. In fact, in the most recent proxy, Mr. Rascoff owns zero shares of Z stock – all his ownership is represented by unexercised options. Every exercise has resulted in immediate sale of the underlying stock.4. The CFO has left the building.Chad Cohen has been with Zillow for 9 years … but just as they are supposed to “dominate” real estate … he leaves. ????5. The company is net losing customers.In a recent web scraping (go sue us) Trulia agents were down around 7% in the quarter on Zillow was only up around 2% Combined agent count was down 2-3K from the last time the company reported … Let’s see if Zillow states this metric on their next call.6. Zillow can never be acquired at its current share price - as validated by the recent Yelp “No Sale”. Somehow bulls have decided that they might not want to wait decades and have floated the rumor of a possible takeout. Despite having a higher quality business than Zillow, and with larger TAM – Yelp could not find a buyer. Internet Giants Do Not Want To Operate Boiler Rooms - Plain and Simple. Yelp’s current market cap is $2.4 billion - that would put Zillow at $40.7. It Ain’t Getting Any Better!Zillow has been unable to make a real profit in one of the largest real estate booms in history - with less competition than it faces now. Besides promises, management has never discussed HOW the business will improve in the future. After all – how many times can you cold call the same pool of real estate agents? 8. Analysts have lost credibility on this name.For years analysts have consistently lowered guidance and raised price targets on Zillow. In the latest 12 months analysts have finally raised estimates as the company has lowered. The sell side has lost all credibility on this name and Wall Street knows it. Case-in-point: It should be noted that the analyst team at Goldman who has a buy on Zillow is the same group that put a $22 target on TRUE in May of this year.9. Competition is only getting stronger.Unlike Yelp, which completely dominates the online review space, Zillow is facing stiff competition from the many VC backed firms that are helping realtors connect with customers. Just go to any real estate conference – Realtors know that Zillow is sooo 1.0. Not to mention - Murdoch!10. Inventory Inventory InventoryZillow has been forced to cut deals with national real estate brand operators for “listing protection”. These have cut deeply into the amount of inventory (ad space on listings) available to sell. Needless to say, a good part of their quality inventory is unavailable for sale, which lowers ROI on what is left. This trend is self-perpetuating. Less inventory = less leads. Blocked Inventory = lower quality leads.$40 a share equals $2.5 billion, which is still a lot of money.For those of you who live in VC/Internet world and think that $2.5 billion is “chump change” we remind you that $40 a share would make Zillow worth the price of the Seattle Seahawks + Seattle Mariners with enough money left over to help bring back the Supersonics.All this for a company who has never generated any real net income.ConclusionZillow spends a ton of money on consumer advertising because Wall Street has indulged it in the hype-driven story that it was going to reshape Real Estate. But the true nature of its business becomes more clear every day, along with the actual business relationship between real estate agents and their listings.

3316685,22148,2015-07-11T11:32:01-04:00,"Zillow announces that the CFO is departing the company on August 7.The company isn't going to see the typical seasonal stock gains.The recommendation is for investors to sit on the sidelines until the Trulia merger and CFO issues are resolved, possibly providing a seasonal buying opportunity in the fall.","The after hours news for Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) isn't very encouraging. The online real estate marketplace continues to feel the impact from a messy integration from the Trulia merger and the latest impact is the CFO leaving the building. The stock that peaked over $160 on the initial announcement of the supposed game-changing merger is now struggling to hold $80 in initial trading after this news.It is never good when a CFO leaves without having another one hired. The timing right after the end of Q2 isn't very encouraging either. At least, Mr. Cohen isn't leaving until August 7 so there isn't anything nefarious going on, but rather the failure to complete the merger on time without impact is starting to have ramifications on the executive suite.My previous research in the article ""Zillow: Keep An Eye Out For The Fall"" had highlighted the seasonal nature of the stock with a preponderance of evidence suggesting the summer months were the time to own the stock. In fact, the data suggested selling the stock on the peak in September and buying it back by early December. Even the impact of the Trulia merger didn't alter that reality too dramatically.In 2014, Zillow peaked in September outside the week of the merger announcement with Trulia. The stock hit a low in early November that was only slightly breached in January due to the delayed merger. Until that point, the seasonal trend remained mostly intact.The CFO news though changes the expectations for the normal rally. By sitting on the sidelines, investors will get an opportunity to review the Q2 and Q3 results to see if Zillow has the Trulia integration back on track. Remember, the stock typically drops in the fall as the peak real estate selling season ends and the monthly metrics decline.As the stock chart above highlighted, Zillow attempted the annual movement of bottoming around November and eventually rallying strong into the spring and summer seasons. The stock though was clobbered by the initial warning related to the sales failures with the Trulia product and some of the surprising internal moves that whacked business in a way that wasn't originally forecasted.At a valuation of about $5 billion, Zillow is no longer absurdly expensive. The stock now trades at less than 6x 2016 revenue estimates. Zillow though will struggle to rally if the company again disappoints the market and the CFO abruptly leaving without a successor sure isn't a good sign of good numbers.The key takeaway is that the hope for the normal summer rally isn't going to occur now with the CFO distractions during July. The original missed merger targets and the CFO departure leave the company scrambling when it should be thriving during the peak real estate season. At this point, the recommendation is to look toward the typical Fall plunge in the stock and watch out for more weak results in the coming quarters."
3281675,86036,2015-06-24T16:11:49-04:00,"Zillow Group’s increasing number of agreements with Multiple Listing Services underpins the online real-estate information marketplace’s growing influence.A very robust housing market, supported by improving job market augurs well for Zillow.However, rising marketing- and sales-related expenses will continue to be a drag on the bottom line.","In July of last year, which is typically a peak home shopping season in the U.S., Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) attracted a record traffic of 89 million monthly unique users. But that was before the acquisition of Trulia. Following the acquisition of Trulia in February, Zillow's combined strength in attracting monthly unique users, has of course sharply increased. In March 2015 alone, nearly 140 million unique users visited Zillow Group consumer brands, which include: Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy and HotPads.I am emphasizing these numbers because they form the basis of Zillow's top-line growth. As I discussed earlier, Zillow, which earns every dollar through its two income streams of marketplace and display, has its revenue directly tied to the amount of traffic it attracts to its sites and mobile platform.The greater the amount of traffic, the higher the number of listings, which translates into more advertising revenues.Rising Agreements with Multiple Listing ServicesIn the past six weeks, Zillow along with Trulia signed 50 new agreements with multiple listing services ((MLSs)), making in total 285 MLSs that have entered in Zillow Group's partnership platform since January 2015. MLSs allow Zillow Group to add accurate and timely feeds on a daily basis, making it very convenient for sellers, buyers and agents alike.Earlier in June, Zillow Group also announced that it has entered in a new agreement with Miami Association of Realtors, which would allow both Zillow and Trulia to receive direct listings. The agreement is very significant step as the association-the biggest in the nation in the realty sector-represents 36000 members in Southeast Florida. Moreover, Miami not only attracts home buyers from across the nation but also remains one of the leading global cities for international property investors.Zillow's rising number of listing agreements with MLS underpins the fact that its clout in the online real-estate information marketplace is growing fast, supported by the acquisition of Trulia.Strengthening Job Market and Rising Home salesThese developments come at a time when the U.S. housing market is witnessing a very strong momentum, boosted by strengthening job market and rising wages. Indeed, first-time home buyers are creating a strong demand, sending property prices northwards.According to the National Association of Realtors, existing home sales rose 5.1% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million-the fastest growth-rate in the last five-and-a-half years. Not only that, May marked the third successive month when existing home sales surpassed 5 million homes. First time home buyers accounted for about 32% of the total number of homes purchased.And this momentum is very likely to continue as wannabe homebuyers will like to close deals before the Federal Reserve hikes the benchmark interest rates. Mortgage rates are still hovering near 4%.In this backdrop, Zillow Group should see increased use of its marketplace, especially during the summer.All said, Zillow's rising operating expenses, mainly tied to sales and marketing will continue to be a drag on the bottom line as the company looks to increase it foothold in the U.S. property information market. Sales and marketing expenses climbed 68% in the fiscal first quarter, year-over-year. This summer Zillow has started its first national TV ad campaign ""Find You Way Home,"" which will run until the end of the year. So, the bottom line will remain under pressure. However, given Zillow's rising number of unique monthly average users and growing partnerships with listing agencies, it is all set for sustainable top-line growth."
3230746,50792,2015-06-02T14:42:54-04:00,Zillow’s stock price has tumbled since the acquisition of Trulia was completed in February.Recent information reveals that the company is working hard to integrate the new company into its current offerings.The increased size and scale of the company will give it the ability to dominate the growing online real estate market in the future.The stock will provide solid returns in 2015 before massive gains in 2016 and beyond.,"Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) provides real estate and home-related information on the Internet and through a mobile app. The company is the largest in this field and recently completed the acquisition of the second largest such company, Trulia, in February. Although the stock price peaked the day after the acquisition was completed, it has fallen over 25% since then.The fall in the stock price is unwarranted, though. The acquisition of Trulia undoubtedly had its troubles, as the deal ended up taking longer than expected to get approval from the Federal Trade Commission. Information from the latest earnings report and a conference call that took place a month earlier presented strong evidence that the acquisition is coming along, and the stock price is set to bounce back before the end of the year.Trulia Being Integrated Into BusinessThe most important thing to take away from the two calls that took place in April and May is the progress of integrating Trulia into Zillow's overall business. As the two most-popular real-estate websites currently operating, they were supposed to not have too many difficulties integrating because of their similarities. This proved to be untrue, as CEO Spencer Rascoff revealed that it had to reduce Trulia's reliance on banner advertisements to improve the site over the long-term.Run as a separate website using the same information as Zillow, Rascoff revealed that this would hurt revenue in the short-term, but would drive growth for the company and improve the overall product the company offers. During that meeting, Rascoff admitted that 2015 would be a transition year for the company as it worked to integrate the new acquisition into the larger company. But he also mentioned that the integration was coming along faster than he had been expecting it to.Source: NYPost.comThe positive overall outlook about integrating Trulia into the company continued during the earnings call in May, when Rascoff mentioned that doing so was the company's biggest priority. Zillow will have fully integrated the new business by the end of the year, setting up the company to progress well until it enjoys an extremely strong 2016 and beyond. At that time, real-estate agents will be able to buy advertising from the combined company and manage its listings across all four of the company's brands, which also include StreetEasy and HotPads in addition to Zillow and Trulia.Increased Scale In Growing MarketMaking the integration of Trulia the top priority makes sense considering the scope and scale that the overall business will have in the online real estate market. Once Zillow's product ecosystem is fully integrated, the company will become much more attractive to real estate professionals, as advertising on the two biggest online real estate markets will be easy and can be done at the same place.In order to make sure that real estate agents want to advertise on their products, Zillow will need to make sure that it continues to increase its audience, another priority of the company. During the first quarter, the company's four brands had 140 million unique visitors, with a good deal of that number coming from mobile apps. These numbers will continue to grow as real estate agents continue to put their listings on Zillow's websites.The listings will also now be exclusively straight from real estate agents, as it is no longer taking MLS listings, which stands for Multiple Listing Service, from ListHub, as its contract expired. In order to make up for the loss of listings from this service, Zillow has signed up hundreds of new MLS partners since the beginning of the year. The increased scale and leadership of the online real estate market will give the company the ability to continue making such partnerships.ConclusionThe recent fall of Zillow's stock price is understandable, but the company is now undervalued. With a strong market position in a field that will grow rapidly in the next few years, this growth stock provides great upside potential to investors. When Trulia is fully integrated into the company, it will be the indisputable place to go for real estate solutions on the Internet. Add in continued growth in mobile, as well as its ability to add more MLS listings in the future, and the company's stock is set to skyrocket next year with solid returns until then. At this price level, the I Know First algorithm is bullish on Zillow."
3225096,22148,2015-06-01T22:58:15-04:00,"So far, Zillow hasn't seen the typical bounce starting in May.The revenue warnings related to the merger have the investment community concerned that it can't achieve long-term goals.The analyst community questions the total addressable market opportunity.Zillow is still forecast to bounce over the summer months, but it is likely headed lower over the winter months due to the lack of momentum.","Quarterly results for Zillow Group (NASDAQ:Z) again reinforce the potential issues with owning a stock in the midst of a major merger. The online real estate marketplace leader went from a major revenue warning in April to a confusing earnings report in May.Most reports showed a revenue miss and a massive earnings beat suggesting analysts didn't correctly adjust for the Trulia merger and appropriately distinguish between GAAP and pro-forma numbers. The end result though is a cleaner picture going forward.Pro-forma ResultsRegardless of the revenue disappointment from the Trulia business or the timing of the merger, the key numbers for investors to focus on are the pro-forma results. Zillow kept the guidance for the full year inline with the previous numbers despite some discussion on the revenue miss for Q1.The decision to invest in Zillow should be based on the following full-year numbers:To that extent, Zillow is now worth roughly $5.94 billion based on 65 million diluted shares outstanding after the merger. At that value, the stock is worth nearly 8.6x 2015 revenue and 72x EBITDA forecasts.The stock value is more compelling looking at 2016 revenue estimates of $880 million, assuming revenue grows by 30%. By the way, Zillow is only forecasting 24% core revenue growth in Q2 when excluding the Market Leader product that it is winding down.Total Addressable MarketBased on those multiples, the company remains a play based on the Zillow marketplace eventually dominating the real estate online market. At this point, Zillow is guiding towards $500 million of revenue in 2015 from agent ad spend compared to the over $10 billion agents spend annually on advertising. In total, the addressable market is estimated at over $13 billion making Zillow an overall small play at this point though maybe the biggest.Interestingly though, a couple of analysts clearly don't agree with the total addressable market being anywhere close to $10 billion so that is a development worth watching going forward. For more information on this topic, investors are encouraged to read the question and answer section of the earnings call transcript.The online market numbers become difficult to measure now that Trulia is part of Zillow and realtor.com is owned by News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWS). Zillow was by far the market leader at the time of the merger and now monthly unique users are up to 140 million during March.Previously, Zillow had the market leading user base at 86.4 million in January. Per company metrics, Zillow averaged 71 million MUUs last Q1.TakeawayThe opportunity to dominate the real estate marketplace is enormous. Agents will continue to push ad spending from traditional media and one-off websites where information quickly becomes dated or isn't overly visible to Zillow. The biggest fear is that the agent community starts pushing back against the dominant force in the industry that Zillow is becoming. In addition, the company has to prove that some of the shortfalls in Trulia revenue wasn't more related to reduced agent spending to prevent the dominance of Zillow.The stock remains expensive considering the weak results. The summer months likely provided the typical boost to the stock (see article Zillow: Don't Sell In May), but the prospects for Zillow heading higher and remaining at those levels for the following Winter doesn't appear likely. At this point, Zillow is only recommended for a seasonal trade. Zillow the company can finally move forward, but Zillow the stock is going to struggle until it reassures the market."

Most people use the site to find the estimate of a particular property.The other side of Zillow is data and data analysis. The reports that can be found on the site cover everything from negative equity reports to the percentage of homes sold for gains, percentage of homes sold for losses, rental information, mortgage rates, and a goldmine of historical information. These reports are particularly useful due to the varied interpretations that are derived when multiple people decipher the same information. Much of the information and data is given in a very straightforward manner and the users are then free to draw their own conclusions. I strongly suggest browsing the site if you want a one-stop in-depth resource for anything and everything related to housing.Take the below information as an example.Here are the five most expensive and five cheapest metropolitan areas as collected from the April 2016 report on Zillow's website:The disparities are unbelievable. You can buy almost eight homes in Detroit for the price of just one home in San Jose, Ca.We were surprised to discover that according to the U.S. Department of Labor's March 2016 unemployment data there is not that large a correlation between unemployment rates and home values:Housing affordability is something often talked about in the press. Interestingly, it is becoming easier to purchase a home, while at the same time more difficult to rent:We do not see an end to this phenomenon. The fact that home values have still not fully recovered from 2008 levels (in most areas of the country) and the still low mortgage interest rates seem to make home purchasing easier for those that can qualify. Unfortunately, for those that cannot qualify (due to no savings for the down payment or inadequate work history) the squeeze of the rental trap continues and shows no signs of abating.The following is the complete list showing median home values and inventory level information on the United Sates and the breakdown of the top 35 metropolitan areas in the United Sates from April 2016:It needs to be pointed out that the data above covers the entire metropolitan area for the cities listed. These areas include the suburbs, which are typically much cheaper. If you want to see the specifics of a city listed above and each of the surrounding suburbs you can click here.Another nice tidbit of information is the trend you can find in the research reports. Take the following two examples:The above chart was extracted from an article describing the rebirth of the rapid ascent in home prices. Using information taken from articles such as this, both potential and current homeowners can make informed decisions regarding their current and future choices regarding potential home ownership decisions. It is nice to not have to navigate through the entire internet for find and decipher information. While prices have not recovered fully from the 2007/2008 peak they are making progress.Here is another analysis. This one is an analysis of the Boston Real Estate market taken from this article (note that while this is an interactive chart you will need to go to the article to use it):What does it all mean? When you see the news and hear about the astronomical real estate prices in cities such as San Francisco, you need to realize that those prices are not indicative of the rest of the country. While housing affordability ultimately hinges on not just home prices but also savings rates and salaries, the information extracted shows that in a majority of the country housing prices are still relatively affordable. I think it is also safe to say that home prices have not recovered from 2008 levels in many areas, particularly in the middle of the country.

3983623,80826,2016-06-22T10:56:39-04:00,The internet has been a disruptive force in multiple industries…why not real estate?Gen X-ers are tech-savvy and don’t fear dealing online.Zillow: The Amazon of online real estate?,"The internet is the most disruptive business platform ever — yet real estate seems impervious.We live in the golden age of information. With access to the internet, everyone can become an ""expert"" in real time. Whatever you want to know, there's usually a way to obtain this information immediately and, if you're not too naïve, fairly accurately.The ability to obtain information about goods and services has been a boon to consumers. For example, if you're in the market for a new dishwasher, it is easy enough to research consumer reports on models, obtain the average price paid in your neck of the woods, and check local inventories. This is all done online and takes minimal time and knowledge; basically, if you're a buyer, the internet has become your most powerful research and pricing tool.Not surprisingly, pricing in most industries has become much more competitive as a direct result of the internet. Look, for instance, at the automotive industry. Or, better yet, let's look at what Digital Trends says about the automotive industry:As Digital Trends says, the internet has taken car buying down to levels where the sellers are getting slim to zero margins. They are willing to do this to obtain other business (loans, service, repair work, etc.). Moreover, the other important point that they mention is the fear of the direct sales model. This is where the consumer can go direct to the seller and cut out the middle man completely.The internet has created a similar scenario of disruption in many other industries. Buying life insurance…who needs a broker? Buying stocks…trade them online if you want. Getting a mortgage? Just apply directly online.The list is long and pretty much inclusive. It seems that consumers have the world at their fingertips and the ability to drive a hard bargain, buy at close to cost and really cut out the middlemen who add little value, yet take a piece of the pie. There is, however, one business that seems to be impervious to the margin squeezing effect of the internet; residential home sales.Gen-Xers are the next generation of home buyersLooking at what happened with car buying, one would imagine that the role of the real estate agent would be affected in a similar way. For example, in the past, a car buyer would go to multiple dealers, kick the tires, drive a few around, then make their decision. Similarly, a home buyer would have their agent take them to a few neighborhoods, discuss the pluses and minuses of each, and show them the available listings in their price range.Today, however, I would gather that most car buyers do their homework a long time before they hit the dealer. They research the model, know the options they want, and show up with an Edmunds price sheet in hand. They have taken the majority of the sales role out of the equation. And, it's a similar situation with home buying. Home buyers have a world of information at their fingertips, including school data, crime data, etc. Most importantly, they can see the available inventory on line in advance and also see the ""market value"" of each house as determined by Zillow or some other online service.Now I'm not saying you don't need a Realtor, but I am saying that a lot of the job of the Realtor can be done by the buyers or sellers themselves. And, if you look outside the US, there is evidence that this is happening. For example, in British Colombia there is a sliding scale; Realtors make 3% on the first couple hundred thousand of a sale price and as little as 1% on the balance. However, this is better than Quebec where as much as 50% of all sales don't even involve a Realtor.Or look at the UK. An article from The Economist, titled ""The Great Realtor Rip-off"", says the following:Now, I love The Economist. It is my favorite magazine. Yet, they are not perfect and, in this case, they are at a loss to explain US Realtor fees. Not to say that I'm smarter than the Economist; I'm definitely not. However, I do have a theory as to why real estate transaction costs haven't come down yet, why I think they are on the verge of a decline, and, even more importantly, why home buying and selling is going to change in the US.It all stems from demographics; I believe the baby boomer generation is scared to NOT use a Realtor. The real estate industry pitches homes as ""your single largest investment"" and tells you that there is a quagmire of paperwork involved, plus potential liabilities, if you try to go it on your own. This is all complete hogwash. However, the baby boomer generation is still scared to put their credit cards online and doesn't have the confidence to tell their neighborhood Realtor, ""hey, I don't need you. I can do this on my own."" Instead, using a Realtor is like a cozy blanket; it makes you feel safe and warm.The next generation, however, doesn't trust people. They have more confidence in what they can research and do online than they have from the Realtor looking to make a very large commission off of their hard work. And, it's a lot of hard work. When you look at certain areas of the country, Realtor fees can be well over $100,000. That's often a year's pre-tax income for an American, much less giving that up after tax!So, my read on demographics is that the next couple of decades of real estate transactions in the US will be led by Gen X. And, they are not scared to venture into the world of the internet or do it yourself. Plus, they will look at Realtor fees increasing faster than their incomes and saying, enough!Check out these headlines:""Gen X Home Ownership on the Rise"" - Daily Real Estate News (May 2, 2016)""Gen-X Homeownership Continues Rising in the First Quarter of 2016"" - National Association of Home Builders' Eye on Housing (April 28, 2016)""Gen X Back in the Housing Game Despite Overall Dip in U.S. Home Ownership"" - Construction Dive (April 29, 2016)It's happening, folks. We are seeing the end of the baby boomer era in the US. The boomers are aging. They are done with buying homes and they are settling into their golden years. The ""Greatest Generation"" is nearing its conclusion.There was, as would be expected, a decline in home sales as we move from the generation of the baby boomers into Gen X. Making this markedly more dramatic is that Gen X is not working off the same time table as the boomers. They are marrying later, starting families later and buying homes later. (By the way, this is even more pronounced in the Millennials…see the NY Times Blog ""Millennials, Living in Their Parents Basement"")Thus, the last decade or so has seen a cosmic shift in most industries as the internet has altered, or decimated, previous operating models. But, it hasn't affected residential real estate transactions because the people doing the transactions are old school. That's right, in my opinion, the vast majority of sales in real estate (not purchases, but the sell side) are taking place with boomers listing homes. And, they don't know the internet, don't trust the internet, and want a Realtor to hold their hand through the process.We are approaching the end of this cycle. As more Gen Xers start buying larger homes or selling their aging parents properties, I believe we will enter a cycle of internet savvy sellers really questioning the value of a Realtor. And, this appears to be happening now. According to Total Mortgage, while FSBO (For Sale By Owner) hasn't picked up dramatically, there is a ""renewal of interest among home sellers in trying to find a way to forgo the traditional six percent commission that real estate brokerages charge. Typically, that means marketing their homes on their own…the Internet may be empowering consumers to reduce the fees they pay real estate brokerages.""Zillow is the Amazon of Real Estate on the InternetI have a few beliefs regarding real estate. First, I believe that home building and home ownership will accelerate. We have under built for years and Gen X hasn't really wanted to participate in home ownership. However, we all start to age and, as people get older, they want to build a nest egg. Owning one's house has always been a cornerstone of this and it will continue to be so.As you can see, housing starts in the US have been well below trend for years. They are starting to pick up and my internal ""reversion to the mean"" logic says that they will continue to do so until the pendulum swings to above average housing starts sometime in the next few years.Now, I've already mentioned that Gen X is appearing to finally be accelerating their participation in the housing market; this is confirmed by the housing starts. How they get into the market is going to be different than in the past, however. They don't have experience with Realtors. Heck, a lot of Gen Xers and Millennials don't have experience dealing with anyone live, they are used to voice recognition software, the internet, etc. Thus, as the real estate market picks up, internet usage for real estate transactions will increase. And, this is where Zillow comes into play.Zillow is the dominant force for real estate on the internet. According to the above graph, if you add in Trulia, which was purchased by them, Zillow accounts for 59% of all unique viewers for real estate websites in the US. This is compelling data, but what makes it even more so is the fact that this data is a year old. According to Zillow's recent earnings call, traffic in January was at 150 million unique viewers and is growing 15 to 25% year over year. For people looking to buy a house, Zillow is the most used option.For those selling their house, Zillow is again the dominant player. They have an option for listing FSBO, but more importantly they have a Premier Agent program where they steer buyers to agents. Zillow claims that the real estate commission market is a $75B market and that they have had their hand in $3.5B of transactions in 2015 through this program. That $3.5B number is a 27% year over year growth rate, by the way, and makes them the industry leader. Furthermore, Zillow is guiding towards large increases in revenue and EBITDA this year, meaning they believe they are maintaining, if not increasing, their dominant market position.I believe that market leadership is the most important thing towards which a company can aspire. When Amazon first came public, there were a lot of skeptics that said it was overvalued. There were also a lot of visionaries that saw Amazon's potential. Amazon took an old business model, brick and mortar retailing, and blew it up. I believe Zillow is doing the same thing with the real estate industry:Valuing Zillow, knowing it's a market leader that is investing in their future, becomes a very tricky thing. Do you value it based on its projected earnings? I think to do so would be incredibly short sighted. As a holder of Z, I want them to lose money, investing in the future. I want them to take out all the competitors making themselves synonymous with real estate. I want them to dominate real estate the way Amazon dominates retail.At the end of the day, I think you value Z based on the potential market size. There is over $1T in real estate changing hands in the US every year. If commissions get cut to 3%, that's $30B. I think it would be easy to see Z taking 20% of this market over time. And, this is just the transaction market. Throw in their mortgage business, leasing, rentals, advertising, etc. and you have a company that has a potential run rate of well over $10B, in high margin business. Heck, they have barely started to scratch the surface of their potential and yet they project over $800 million in revenue in 2016.Now, I know this is strictly back of the envelope accounting and has large room for errors. That's not the point. Rather, the point is that Z is going to dominate a large market and the potential upside is tremendous. All for a company with current market cap of $6B.I don't know what the future holds, but I do know fellow leader Amazon has a $300B market cap. More interestingly, over the last 10 years, AMZN market cap has tracked its revenue to a high degree. Amazon, like Zillow, has sacrificed near term profits for long term dominance. I suspect the market cap of Zillow should track their revenue growth as well. Therefore, as long as its future looks like one of growth and dominance, I will continue to be a strong supporter of Z.At the end of the day, Zillow will leave the competition weepingJust as the internet is a great disrupter, shredding older business models, it is also a great consolidator. As we've seen with Walmart destroying the Mom and Pop stores, Amazon is currently taking over retail online, Google is synonymous with search these days, and Facebook is the only social media platform most people use. All these companies have taken advantage of the scale of the internet, invested heavily (suffering years of losses) and now have a dominant position. I suspect Zillow is going to accomplish the same thing.This is not a company you should try to put a multiple on. Instead, look at the size of the marketplace, the trends in the business and ask yourself: Does Zillow have what it takes to be the 800-pound gorilla in this space? I believe the answer is yes."
3227246,88786,2015-06-01T13:25:24-04:00,"Zillow has been an incredible growth story over the last four years.After merging with Trulia, it is now experiencing a difficult transition period as it is learning how to manage economies of scale.Robust growth still looks extremely promising at this point. However, investors are still required to keep an eye on Zillow.Since this business has not yet turned a profit, expectations are high and there is very little room for mistakes.With huge greenfield opportunities, long-term investors need to be patient while sticking to their convictions.","Managing Post-Merger TransitionThe union of Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and Trulia has been extremely rough. The stock price of Zillow fluctuated wildly during that period as bulls and bears duke it out on whether this company is merely a fad or if it can really succeed in the real estate arena. CEO Spencer Rascoff couldn't be more pleased as he started off the company's recent conference call by addressing the new entity as ""Zillow Group"".Here are some key plays that Zillow Group will be executing in 2015 and it would be crucial for investors to keep an eye on them so as to hold management accountable:He also acknowledged that the road ahead will be extremely bumpy and that the entire process will take time to bear fruit. The difficult part of it is that the management is having a tough time distinguishing themselves amongst customers, while in the same breath trying to work as an integrated economic unit.Robust Growth Is In PlaceConsumer facing brands such as Zillow, Trulia, Hotpads and StreetEasy attracted nearly 140 million monthly unique users in March 2015 alone. This is an enormous figure and it is expected to increase as the merger evens out. Experiencing a bumpy ride during transitional phases is part and parcel of doing business. When a company executes huge movements simultaneously during a period where momentum is on its way to the peak, one should not be surprised at an increase in share price volatility.Chad Cohen also indicated that this business is experiencing growth in multiple areas. For its core revenue driver, Marketplace revenue was $108.9 million, which includes $6.1 million of Market Leader revenue, reflecting robust growth across Real Estate and Mortgage revenue sub-categories. The Zillow Premier Agent program saw significant growth, with 54% Average Revenue per Advertiser (ARPA) growth from advertisers who were with them a year ago. Also, approximately 63% of new sale bookings went to existing advertisers buying more impressions across mobile and web in their sales areas. Zillow is also executing well in mortgages and rentals, and all of StreetEasy's usage metrics were up at least by 50% year over year.Potential Problems That May AriseZillow is executing very well, and growth is still vigorous. That, however, does not mean that shareholders should stop keeping an eye on Zillow. The integration with Trulia is proving to be far more difficult than expected. Management needs to thread the needle very carefully while trying to accomplish what it sets out to do.If Zillow shows any signs of slowing down, it will be punished by the market. Since it has not yet turned a profit or generated any free cash flow, any negativity will have direct impact on the share price. Investors need to know that there is very little room for blunders.ConclusionAs the company is currently in a transitional phase, investors might feel uncertain as to whether to take a position in Zillow. What we can do is to observe where the company is heading for the next half of the year before we add to our thesis.Overall, Zillow's robust growth continued this quarter despite struggling through integration pains and while trying to tap into potential markets. The more Zillow scales and branches into adjacent markets, the stronger its competitive advantage becomes.Investors can expect to see revenue growth to continue while margins improve. Expansion over the next few years is likely to keep going as Zillow and Trulia are working on how they can work better together in a more efficient way.A $13 billion market opportunity still remains untapped by Zillow and that means investors can remain confident that this business still has plenty of room to run."
3080216,22148,2015-04-20T05:48:48-04:00,"Zillow shocked the market with a large warning following the merger with Trulia.The protracted merger process was blamed for the revenue short fall, but the company outlined some self inflicted issues.Zillow probably follows the seasonal trends higher during the summer, but the company has a lot to prove to justify a higher stock price.","Considering the nature of the real estate marketplace, the big push at the start of April was to look towards Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) for a stock to own during the summer doldrums in the market. Previous research (see Zillow: Don't Sell In May) determined that the stock rallies each year starting on May 1.The company though shocked the market (or did the market know considering the stock rebound) with a massive warning last Monday. Just as Zillow heads into the peak real estate selling period, the company faces sales issues from Trulia blamed on the protracted Federal Trade Communications merger approval process.Should investors continue following the normal seasonal trends with the stock?What Happened?Back on February 18, Zillow announced the completion of the merger with Trulia creating the leading real estate online marketplace. At the time, the company failed to mention any issues with protracted sales processes with advertisers on Trulia due to the uncertainty on the merger. It does highlight the normal issues with moving parts during a merger.What the company did was guide towards revenue of $690 million, down from estimates of $753 million. More importantly, EBITDA forecasts were slashed to $82.5 million at the midpoint, down from $146 million.The ironic part is that a lot of the identified issues relate to cutting short-term revenue opportunities from the Trulia properties including less display ads and less advertising revenue on rentals due to shifting away from a third-party provider. Most importantly though, the cutting of sales staff has apparently left the company short of sales reps. None of these issues relate to a lengthy merger process.It does leave the question of whether agents are less willing or interested in advertising on the Trulia sites, now that Zillow owns them.As forecast in the previous article, losing the ListHub listings had no material impact to the business. The desire of agents and home sellers are to have their listings on Zillow. If anything, this move has helped push MLSs to send listings directly to the marketplace leader and is a prime example of where the large scale of the combined entities helps force the market in that direction.Analysts Aren't Buying ItThe company hinted that 2016 would be as expected, but analysts aren't buying that projection. The revenue estimate for 2015 is down below guidance to $682 million and more importantly the EPS estimate for 2016 was slashed. Analysts have cut nearly $1 off the 2016 estimates. Oddly, the estimate is actually below the forecasts prior to closing the merger that promised $100 million in synergies. At this point, the deal isn't even forecast to become accretive in 2016.Source: Yahoo! FinanceOppenheimer provides a prime example of the current lid on the stock until the company proves otherwise. If 2016 revenue grows over 30% to $900 million, it will take the stock trading at 7.5x those revenue estimates to reach $101.On the flip side, if Zillow reaches the long-term target of 40% EBITDA margins due to consolidating the industry and achieving the cost synergies, the stock will eventually go much higher. Just 20% of the total $13 billion spent on real estate advertising would lead to revenue of $2.6 billion. At a 40% EBITDA margin, Zillow would produce a hefty $1 billion in EBITDA per year. At a multiple of 15x, the stock would trade for $15 billion providing a tidy 200% gain from here.This major warning places a large concern of whether agents are less willing to spend on Zillow, feeling it will weld too much power over the industry in the future.TakeawayThe transition period appears worse than even forecast by the company. The stock probably does well during the summer with momentum investors buying it up, but it faces tons of downside risk heading into the seasonally weak period in the fall. To maintain a stock price near $100, Zillow needs to justify that the company can actually reach those original synergies that had analysts forecasting 2016 earnings jumping to $2.50 per share.With the stock trading at about 8x the new 2015 revenue estimates, Zillow is no bargain for a stock that needs to prove this merger will work. One still can envision Zillow becoming the leading real estate marketplace that grabs the vast lion share of the estimated $13 billion spent on advertising for the sector, but it doesn't mean the stock actually heads higher in the next year with a valuation of $5.6 billion."
3193156,86036,2015-05-18T16:22:21-04:00,"Zillow has produced phenomenal revenue growth, thanks to its ever-increasing average monthly unique users.Still, shares have been under pressure amid rising sales and marketing and acquisition related costs, which have dented the bottom line.With the acquisition of Trulia, Zillow Group is expected to grow at a much faster pace.Zillow offers a good buying opportunity as it remains a long-term growth stock.","Despite Zillow's (NASDAQ:Z) phenomenal growth in revenue, its performance in the stock market in last one year has been disappointing. I believe investors have been overcautious due to two reasons: Zillow's failure to post operating profits and concerns over timely integration between Trulia and Zillow.Zillow hasn't posted a net profit in the last two years. Its bottom line has felt the pinch due to increasing operating expenses. In fiscal 2013 and 2014, expenses related to sales and marketing, and technology upgrades jumped sharply, while acquisition-related costs also pushed the company into a loss on GAAP basis.Zillow was again off to a shaky start this fiscal year. In the first quarter, it posted wider-than-expected loss as it took charges related to the acquisition of Trulia. Trulia's $2.5 billion stock swap acquisition deal was completed on February 17.Strong Long-term ProspectsStill, the company has too many positives to set aside market's apprehension. Just look at the phenomenal growth in its traffic (number of average monthly unique users), which is driving its top- line growth.Zillow generates revenue from two sources: marketplace and display. The growth in revenue is directly proportional to increase in traffic, i.e., the number of visitors who visit Zillow's websites and mobile applications. In other words, more the traffic, the more sellers, real-estate agents, and renters will list properties on Zillow's platforms.Thanks to its dynamic and all-encompassing living database, Zillow's monthly users' traffic has been increasing at a very brisk pace. Indeed in July (which is seasonal peak for home shopping), Zillow posted a record traffic of 89 million monthly unique users - a fourfold increase in the number after it became a public company in 2011. Not surprising then that the company's revenue has jumped to almost $326 million in fiscal 2014 from $66 million in 2011.Trulia's acquisition will further expand Zillow's audience base. In the recently concluded quarter which ended March 31, Zillow recorded about 109 million average monthly unique users compared to about 70 million average monthly unique users, in the same period of last fiscal year.The other big plus for Zillow Group is that it has successfully monetized its mobile applications. In online marketplaces, more and more people prefer mobile devices to make buying decisions. Thanks to a very effective mobile strategy across all major platforms, more than 65% of Zillow's total traffic comes from mobile devices. In addition, Trulia's acquisition will further strengthen Zillow's mobile traffic growth.Bottom LineAccording to Borrell Associates Inc., real estate agents and brokers spent $13.6 billion on all form of advertising last year, which represented 7.9% growth, year-over-year. Borrell estimates that total ad spends by brokers and agents will increase by 2.2% in 2015.Zillow Group, at present, attracts a fraction of total ad spend budget. Therefore, Zillow has tremendous growth opportunities looking ahead given the size of addressable real estate advertising market.As for rising operating expenses, these should subside in due course. We have to remember that Zillow is in its initial growth stage. Operating expenses, especially those related to selling and marketing, are typically high at this stage.As for integration of Trulia, the company recently said that it is on the right track. It expects all features of agent advertising products to become integrated between Zillow and Trulia by the end of this fiscal year."
3053386,22148,2015-04-07T15:28:55-04:00,"Seasonal trends suggest that Zillow's stock should be held through the summer months.Recent analyst downgrades have the stock trading at yearly lows heading into the typical strong period.The stock isn't cheap, but the seasonal pattern is too compelling to ignore.","The market tends to run in seasonal patterns that typically suggest investors sell in May and take the summer off. The majority of returns are made by stocks during the winter months while the summer is flat. While that pattern hasn't really followed in the last few years, possibly due to the popularity of the theme, some stocks are clear winners during the summer months that provide alpha for investors that own them specifically.One specific example is Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), which provides an online real estate marketplace. Previous research (see Zillow: Keep An Eye Out For The Fall) highlighted the compelling seasonal trends in the stock. What wasn't highlighted in the article is how Zillow is even a better play to own in May compared to the market. Some recent weakness in the stock following the Trulia merger regarding listings has pushed the stock back down below $100, possibly providing the typical buying opportunity.Buy In MayAs previously highlighted, Zillow trades in a seasonal pattern favoring buying the stock in November or December and selling it during the Fall in September, as the peak real estate season ends. Further research shows that investors can use the stock as a specific hedge against the summer doldrums in the market. Though investors don't always obtain peak gains by delaying the purchase to May, the gains have been sizeable the last couple of years to use the stock as a hedge.Comparing the returns of Zillow to the iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:IYR) and the S&P 500 index via the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), Zillow has had phenomenal returns buying the stock on May 1 each year and selling at the end of August.The 2013 period return was an incredible 55.7% return for Zillow while the real estate segment actually declined.The 2014 period return was a strong 34%, while the SPY and IYR had solid returns of roughly 6%.Though not charted, the 2012 return for Zillow during that time period was roughly 20% setting a three-year string of large gains.Listing Inventory IssuesA prime reason Zillow gave up the large gains following the approval of the Trulia merger was the disagreement regarding listings with ListHub, owned by competitor Realtor.com. News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWS) (NASDAQ:NWSA) bought the site last year.Cowen went so far to cut Zillow's price target to $105 due to the end of the listings that was expected to last until 2016 on Trulia. The analyst forecasts that Trulia will lose up to 10% of their listings.To replace these listings, Zillow stepped up efforts to obtain listings directly from the MLS. Starting in March, the company has signed agreements with over 100 MLSs for direct listings including the nation's largest MLS and the California Regional MLS providing a higher number of for-sale-by-agent listings on April 8.If anything, it appears that, given the combination of the Zillow and Trulia merger and Realtor.com now controlled by News Corp., listing agents now see it in their best interest to have accurate listings on Zillow. In fairness though, Barclays suggests Zillow is offering discounts to brokerages to obtain listing inventory. The analyst remains long-term bullish due to the ability of Zillow to control the market and eventually charge premium prices.TakeawayOf course, nothing guarantees that this seasonal pattern will repeat again. With Zillow trading at yearly lows, the stock is positioned for another run during this seasonal period when the real estate market perks up. The stock trades at about 40x 2016 EPS estimates so it isn't a cheap stock."
3160736,87716,2015-05-08T14:12:28-04:00,"Zillow appears to have strengthened its already dominant position in online real estate, but they face growing competition in the near future.Increasing data availability and decreasing web development costs lower the barrier of entry for new competitors.National and Regional real estate brokerages have the motivation and means to compete with Zillow.","At a glance, Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) appears to have strengthened its already dominant position as the go-to online real estate portal with the acquisition of their nearest rival, Trulia. Although well documented legal troubles with Move, Inc.'s Realtor.com® and the discontinued syndication deal with ListHub point to some immediate concerns for the real estate giant, Zillow's dominance in the growing online real estate market is undeniable.Notwithstanding their current frustration arising from Listing data and the feuding with Move, Inc., Zillow has demonstrated that access to MLS data is not going to be a retardant to the next chapter of their growth.The real danger to Zillow's vision for building on their current success revolves around threats to their web traffic. A recent downgrade by Barclays cites ""slowing web traffic growth"" as the biggest long-term concern for Zillow. These concerns are well founded and warrant further examination.Understanding the constant dissatisfaction felt by the real estate broker community, Zillow's biggest source of revenue, is necessary to appreciate much of the threat to Zillow's web traffic growth. One does not have to look far to find frustrated agents and brokers venting their malice toward Zillow's business model. The most common complaint is that brokers feel as though Zillow has worked their way in-between agents and clients. They have managed to do so by using the listing data (MLS listing data is supplied by MLS member agents and brokers) to lure prospective homebuyers and sellers to Zillow, only to turn around and sell those customer leads back to the brokers whose data generated the leads in the first place.What can the brokers do about it?Most brokers have a web presence via their own website, and through their local MLS membership, they are able to display properties for sale in their local markets. However, because Zillow has a more robust property data set, they are able to expand their footprint by displaying every property in that market, not just those for sale or rent. Obtaining these unlisted properties is a necessary step for local brokerages to really compete for a significant piece of Zillow's traffic. Many of the people searching for properties begin by searching for an address in their neighborhood or looking up a desired community. In any given market, roughly 3% of homes may be listed on the MLS at any given time. The other 97% of properties do not appear on local brokers' websites.Why does less data from Zillow's competition affect web traffic?Primarily, Zillow has close to complete coverage in most markets, regardless of a property's listing status. Therefore, any address that is searched produces a top Zillow result. Many users arrive at Zillow this way and then navigate on to other properties that are for sale. Alternatively, if you only have listed properties on your site, you will only be returned as a search result when those specific addresses are searched. Likewise, Zillow will have hundreds or thousands of properties in a neighborhood where a broker may only have a handful. In the eyes of search engine algorithms, this added data makes Zillow appear to be a better search result for neighborhood queries. Local broker sites may not even make the top 10 results because they have, in Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) eyes, less relevant data to a search query for a given neighborhood.The problem of insufficient data is not insurmountable. There are a growing number of data suppliers that offer nearly complete national coverage. For a regional brokerage, obtaining property data for a specific market is not too costly, and national coverage has become much more affordable in recent years. The increased availability of property data is likely due to the push for collection and standardization at the state and national level. Currently, each county's property appraiser, or equivalent governing body, collects and maintains property details, sales history, and geographic parcel boundaries. However, several states have begun to collect and standardize this data, making it publicly available.Over the last decade, there has been a push to collect and standardize all property data at the national level. The Federal Geographic Data Committee oversees the sharing of geographic data, and numerous reports have been published which identify the need for a national parcel database. These facts point to the eventuality of ubiquitous property data. Zillow may wake up one day to find that every real estate broker's website not only has their own MLS data, but 100 million plus properties for the entire country.The pressure from regional and national brokerages is not mere speculation; they have not been sitting idly by as Zillow cuts into their bottom line by making them pay for leads garnered from their own listings. They are specifically targeting a reduced reliance on Zillow's lead flow. This year, one of the nation's largest real estate brokerages, NRT, launched HomesForSale.com with the specific intent to flank Zillow and generate leads nationally.According to a RealTrends newsletter, 51% of the 204 million unique visitors to real estate websites in 2014 came through organic search results. New entries struggle to gain traffic because it is difficult to compete with the well-established giants that dominate the search engine results. However, in 2014, Google released an algorithmic change. Primarily, the change was geared toward giving local search results priority on search results pages. This type of change gives an advantage to local brokers through Google's inherent ""local bias."" As Google clearly states, ""If you have a brick and mortar business, or target online customers in a particular area, you can help Google provide relevant information to local users"" which will make your site ""more discoverable and indexable by Google."" In other words, once the local and regional real estate brokerages start to implement the quantity of data that is more frequently becoming publicly available and couple that with the inherent advantage from the locally based business bias, Zillow may be displaced as the leading result for search terms they effectively dominate right now.Google rankings only tell part of the story. Market research suggests that when all things are equal, consumers prefer local products and businesses. Real estate is no exception, and in fact, real estate is locally focused by its very nature. Think about it, if you have two comparable website experiences, would you rather work with a local broker who lives and works in your area or an impersonal, national firm like Zillow who serves you up to the highest bidding broker? The answer seems obvious, especially for real estate consumers. Right now, Zillow so heavily dominates the online real estate market that the consumers don't often see those local options, but once they do, the local and regional players will have an inherent advantage over Zillow. Even if the brokers do not usurp Zillow as the top result for a given real estate search term, they will still pose a meaningful threat as the #2 or #3 result.Does Zillow's real estate technology insulate them from the competition?While it's true that Zillow offers some cutting-edge features on their site, much of what constitutes the core of their service is no longer out of reach to the operators of smaller websites. With the data and listings already accounted for, the only technology required for competitors is a smooth user interface, the ability to search for properties within the website, and mapping technology. Most of these necessary components have been commoditized and made available from third parties, while others can be developed relatively inexpensively. The most sophisticated technology offered by Zillow, such as the Zillow affiliate program and Zillow API, are unnecessary add-ons that have very little to do with the typical user's experience. If the barrier to entry was so great, there would not be such a surge in new portal startups. Frankly, there are dozens of sites built on small budgets with an arguably cleaner and more interesting experience than Zillow.ConclusionZillow has to build on their clear first mover advantages. Their top priority right now is branding. If Zillow can establish themselves as the default search tool for homebuyers and sellers, they can bypass Google and other search engines. This is a tall order, but it is one to which Zillow needs to remain committed. It is important to recognize the challenge Zillow faces with their target audience, the current and future generations of homebuyers and sellers starting their buying or selling process online. Today's generation of technology users have revealed themselves to be quite fickle and mercurial when it comes to brand loyalty. For example, BlackBerry (BBRY) moved from an approximate 20% market share to less than 1% in a matter of years, even though there was a time when all serious professional smartphone users would not even consider an alternative. The rapid pace of technological development forces companies to be constantly innovating or fall by the wayside. The key to Zillow's investment in technology is developing features that are essential to the user experience, something that makes a homebuyer or seller say, ""Hey, I have to go to Zillow if I want the best property search tool."" That sentiment may have been true at one time, but as of right now, Zillow has not shown its users what this ""must have"" technology will be to maintain its ""go-to status"" in the future.Zillow's core business remains in a strong position, but considering the already slowing growth in web traffic and increasing competition for their users, we have a negative outlook for the stock. We are a seller of Zillow at the current levels. Zillow's valuation today does not adequately reflect the aforementioned risks, nor does it offer a suitable reward to shareholders for the uncertainty that comes with their need to develop new, ""must-have"" proprietary technology, as well as the necessity that they execute a very challenging branding exercise in order to maintain their market position."

A year and a half later, and surprisingly, little has changed.For sure, Zillow's (NASDAQ:Z) stock went on a wild roller coaster ride since I published that article. It surged up above $160 back in 2014, then plunged below $100. Now it's back at $112. That means it has returned about 23% since my article, while the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) index has returned 24%. Overall, it's a wash.Nevertheless, the stock remains significantly overpriced, and one that I'd advise long-term investors to shy away from. None of this is a case against Zillow, the company. When buying a house last year, I used the site frequently and found it to be my preferred one. As a company, I love Zillow; but this is a case of ""good company, terrible stock."" Investors continue to ignore the valuation risks. Zillow is still extremely overpriced over $100.Here are six major reasons why.1. Lack of Pricing PowerThe surge of Zillow's stock is largely based on a misunderstanding of the company's business model. Many believe Zillow to the American equivalent of REA Group (RGPRF). REA Group is an Australian real estate marketing firm, partly owned by News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWS). The company owns the popular Australia online real estate portal realestate.com.au. It also owns real estate listing sites in Hong Kong (squarefoot.com.hk) and Italy (casa.it).REA Group has been wildly successful. It has grown operating cash flows from $76 million in FY 2011 to $184 million in FY 2014 (both figures in Australian dollars). Capex requirements are limited as well, as the company spent about $26 million for property and equipment, as well as intangible assets in FY 2014. Free cash flows have grown from $55 million in 2011 to $157 million in 2014.Contrast that with Zillow, which has produced no notable free cash flow growth.REA and Zillow may look similar on the face of it, but the cash flow picture is dramatically different. The reason REA is growing cash flows rapidly while Zillow continues to struggle can summed up in two words: ""pricing power."" REA Group has it, Zillow does not.Zillow is largely dependent upon companies like Realogy (NYSE:RLGY), Re/Max, and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) for listings. Realogy, owner of Century 21 and Coldwell Banker, is the bigger player in this space. Not only does RLGY sell its listings for very little, but the company has an attractive deal with Zillow that allows it to block competing agent ads.Zillow does okay working with Realogy, but it's clear that Realogy has the power in the relationship. If Realogy wanted to cut ties with Zillow, it could do so very easily. The reverse is not true; Realogy would do just fine without Zillow.That said, I'd ignore some of the gloom-and-doom assessments that suggest Realogy or another big real estate company will beat Zillow at its own game. Zillow has done an excellent job at developing the best online real estate website in the US. As a company, Zillow has real value; it's just that its niche is not a very attractive one economically. It's a middleman that can easily be squeezed by other parties.2. High Share Compensation ExpenseIf there's one item in Zillow's financial statements that I'd use some caution with, it's the company's share compensation expense. It's true that share compensation is factored into Net Income, but the figure often gets ignored in cash flow analysis, since it's a non-cash expense. Yet, it's a non-cash expense that actively dilutes the intrinsic value of ownership shares. Hence, its ""non-cash"" status is misleading.The chart below shows Z's share comp expense as a percentage of revenue. Note that this has hovered in the 10-12% range for the past two years, which is extremely high.Of course, there's nothing wrong with using shares to compensate employees, but this is excessive. Moreover, it leads to very misleading cash flow metrics.3. Sales & Marketing ExpensesZillow is priced like a tech company, with a high degree of operating leverage. Yet, it's really just an old-fashioned sales organization, with largely variable costs. This is most visibly demonstrated by its sales and marketing expenses, which have increased as a percentage of revenues over time, in spite of extraordinarily high revenue growth. Sales and marketing expense is now at 55.6% of revenue.Once again, this isn't a ""good"" or ""bad"" thing per se. It's just that the stock is priced more with the idea that Zillow has a high degree of operating leverage. Yet, its expenses suggest the exact opposite.4. Free Cash Flow NegativeZillow has tried to push the cash flow story over net income; yet, there are a few holes with this. For one, acquisitions are eating up a lot of cash. If you go back up to the chart comparing REA Group and Zillow, you can see that Z's acquisition costs have been much higher. The second issue goes back to the share compensation expense, which distorts the cash flow figures.In the chart below, you can see a few free cash flow variants. What becomes apparent very quickly is that once you factor in share-based compensation, free cash flows look horrid. The last row of this chart (highlighted in green) showcases this. For FY 2013, Zillow's free cash flows were $58 million in the red when you factor in acquisitions and share compensation. For the first three quarters of FY 2014, that same figure is at negative $30 million; a slight improvement, but still a long way from being healthy.Given all this, it's fair to look at the valuation.5. Multiples Make No SenseThere's a famous Scott McNeely quote on the tech bubble that seems particularly apt here:If Zillow were priced at $15, I would be writing a very different article. I might point out that the company has a long, hard road ahead, but that it has made major progress towards its goals and likely has significant value to an outside party. I'd argue that in spite of its poor cash flows, the company's true value might be high enough to make the stock an attractive bargain.At over $100, however, it's a very different story. It's difficult to come up with any realistic path to justify the valuation. Zillow sells at over 15 times revenue. Even if its revenue growth is quite healthy, this multiple makes little sense for a firm that is cash flow-negative and lacks operating leverage. Zillow also has a projected forward P/E of 108. This is a tech bubble valuation, and it's difficult to imagine that it will hold over the next 3-5 years as the reality becomes more apparent.Here's another interesting tidbit. If you were to assume that 20x were a reasonable long-term P/E ratio for Zillow, then the company would need to produce a profit of about $200 million annually, based on its current share count of 40 million shares, to justify the valuation. For FY 2014, Zillow will have revenues around $320 million.Start doing some math there, and it's nearly impossible to make that work out. Even if Zillow were to grow to revenues to $800 million in three years, that would still mean the company would need to produce 25% profit margins to make those numbers work. And remember, the share count is increasingly rapidly, so in three years, there could be 52 million shares; which would mean on $800 million revenue, Zillow would need 32.5% profit margins to achieve a profit high enough to hit a 20x P/E ratio.Simply put, there's no plausible way to make the math justify the valuation. Even if Zillow can increase revenues to $1 billion in 3 years (a 45% annualized growth rate), achieve a 20% profit margin, and we assign a liberal P/E multiple of 30x to it, that would give it a hypothetical valuation of $120 in 2018.That would mean you should expect a 2.3% annual return over the next three years. That's a very optimistic scenario, and you'd still make a lackluster return. Indeed, you'd be better off buying a boring electric utility stock or owning long-term US Treasuries.Zillow, at $100+, makes no sense. It's overpriced in the extreme, based on risks and rewards.6. Insider Dumping ContinuesIt's not like Zillow's management isn't aware that the stock is gross overvalued. That's why they continue to dump shares like mad. Over the past year, I calculate over $600 million in share sales.In my recent article on insider selling, I detail that there are many reasons that insiders choose to sell shares. However, there's really only one way to interpret the mass selling of the type seen at Zillow over the past few years. Virtually no major executive or office inside that company believes the stock is worth anywhere near $100.ConclusionsZillow is extremely overvalued at $100. I'd personally value it at around $20-25. As for long-term investors, I'd advise them to keep far, far away. Stocks like this can ignore the laws of gravity for a few years, but eventually, they will take a massive plunge. Owning Zillow in 2015 is like owning First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) in April 2008 or any major tech stock in 2000."
2772785,48711,2014-12-23T11:09:38-05:00,"The shareholder approval now makes deal consummation a near certainty.
        Investors will likely realize 10 - 15% unlevered annualized profits if the deal closes in the next 3 -4 months.
        The only remaining roadblock is a pending review by the FTC, which seems likely to approve the deal due to legal precedent.","America's top two online real estate search engines Zillow (NASDAQ: Z) and Trulia (NYSE: TRLA) merged back in late July and today the deal received overwhelming shareholder approval. The consummation of the deal is now more likely and there remains a small window for investors to realize arbitrage profits. The small potential profits of merger arbitrage are a safe way to boost returns in a volatile market because of the high likelihood of deal approval after announcement. The only roadblock holding this deal up is a pending Federal Trade Commission review. The following will provide a brief overview of the methods used when arbitrage is most successful and detail how they apply to the Zillow - Trulia deal.A Secret of the World's Most Successful Investor: ArbitrageWarren Buffett would arbitrage mergers when he felt the market to be elevated and/or if he could not find attractive companies for a fair price. He deemed mergers, liquidations, recapitalizations, and spinoffs as ""workouts"" in his letters to partners. Arbitrage is one of the least understood areas of Buffett's investment strategies and part of the reason for his splendid investment record over 60 years. Since Buffett started his partnership in 1956, his investors have only lost wealth in two of those years (2001 and 2008) while the S&P was down 13 times during the same period. During the bear market of 1973 - 1974 Berkshire increased it's per share book value a combined 10.2% while the S&P lost a combined 41.2%!Investing in arbitrage deals should result in satisfactory profits for investors during periods when market returns may not be quite as favorable. Buffett did a study of his mentor Ben Graham's partnership and discovered that arbitrage investing returned close to 20% annually for Graham's partnership.It should be emphasized that all 59 deals closed that Buffett participated in from 1980 - 2003, which strengthens the argument of arbitrage investing being both profitable and a shrewd risk reduction strategy. The key to successful arbitrage is knowing what to look for in a deal that makes the probability of its closing almost 100%. As Buffett mentions in his 1988 letter, arbitrage can be an attractive place to put excess cash for value investors having a hard time finding attractive opportunities. When an investor knows what to look for, arbitrage commitments can often return 10 - 20%, which is often better than bonds and most certainly money market funds or short term commercial or government paper.Arbitrageurs stand to profit from the small price spread that exists AFTER the deal has been announced. The Zillow - Trulia deal has obviously been announced so investors investing at this stage are not risking their capital on the speculative anticipation of a merger. Only by investing in deals after announcement is the risk of investing in these deals substantially reduced.In a typical arbitrage deal company ""A"" offers to buy company B for a specified price. Company A's stock price jumps to a level near the offer price but does not typically reach the acquisition price because of the uncertainties regarding closing conditions such as board and shareholder approval and anti-trust reviews by regulatory authorities. This resulting price spread is where arbitrageurs stand to profit.The Five Reasons a Successful Consummation of the Zillow - Trulia Merger is LikelyBelow are some key factors that make mergers more likely to happen and how they apply to the Trulia - Zillow merger.The One Remaining Roadblock and an Important Legal PrecedentZillow and Trulia are number one and two respectively in the online real estate market. The question hinges on whether regulators will consider online advertising and offline advertising the same. If they do, then regulators are likely to approve the merger because the real estate advertising market is extremely broad and the combined company would unlikely have the ability to collude on prices and cut out competition. On the other hand, if federal regulators do deem the online advertising and offline advertising to be different then there is a slight possibility they could terminate the deal because the combined Zillow and Trulia that would result could have the power to employ restrictive trade practices on the ""all-encompassing online real estate market."" As antitrust lawyer Amanda Wait of Hunton & Williams LLP puts it, ""If the FTC agrees that Internet ads are part of the same pie as offline options ""then this is probably a pretty easy case because there are lots of places you can advertise,"" said antitrust lawyer Amanda Wait of Hunton & Williams LLP, a former FTC attorney. ""If the FTC were to define the market as just online advertising, then this is a little more problematic.""Source: Review of Zillow-Trulia Merger Hinges on Advertising, Wall Street JournalFor comparison purposes, the FTC spent about one year analyzing the merger between CoStar Group Inc. and LoopNet (the two largest commercial real-estate information providers) but eventually approved the deal after requiring the newly merged company to sell an ownership stake in another commercial real estate venture. Ms. Wait went on to say that websites have not changed the methods buyers and sellers choose to buy and sell their homes, which is typically through agents. Ms. Wait also said that the combined entity could have the power to raise prices but that ""Realtors still have the leverage.""My take is that the real estate market is fragmented to the point that regulators will conclude the online and offline exchanges to be different. Regulators may require the newly formed Zillow - Trulia to sell assets but according to the legal precedent regarding the CoStar - LoopNet deal, lawmakers likely do consider the online and offline marketplaces to be distinct entities.Return ProjectionsThe following models make three assumptions.Note: Borrowing costs were not included because for highly liquid securities, the cost to borrow is negligible, often less than 1% annualized. However, ""hard to borrow"" stocks cost more so be sure the fees are minimal before placing any trades.Below are the approximate returns investors would realize if the deal is consummated by in two months February 18, 2015:Below are the approximate returns investors would realize if the deal is consummated by March 18, 2015:Below are the approximate returns investors would realize if the deal is consummated by April 18, 2015:Below are the approximate returns investors would realize if the deal is consummated by May 18, 2015:Below are the approximate returns investors would realize if the deal is consummated by June 18, 2015:ConclusionArbitrageurs will likely realize over seven percent annualized returns if the deal is completed by June. If the deal is consummated by say March or April, returns will likely be 11-15%.Be sure to consult your broker regarding margin rates. Utilizing arbitrage strategies will likely produce satisfactory results in a bear market, (as they are dependent on corporate events as stock market vagaries) but may not perform as well in a rising market.Recommendation: Buy TRLA, short Z.Works Cited:Buffett, M., & Clark, D.

2820926,72385,2015-01-14T15:16:40-05:00,Zillow’s promise is its new and disruptive use of online real estate listings.Zillow has since its promised merger with Trulia been transitioning from a rapid-growth company valued on its promise into a company that is being traded at a more fundamental valuation.It is dubious whether Zillow will be able to fulfill its share price expectations.,"The promise of Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) is its new and disruptive use of online real estate listings. It meets a real market need for entry-level online real estate searches. This need is evidenced by Zillow's rapid revenue growth and customer loyalty. Zillow bulls believe that a paradigm shift is occurring right now in home buying and selling, and that in the future persons will predominately find their homes online. But upon closer inspection it becomes clear that this bull case is being swallowed too readily by the investing community and that Zillow shares are not in fact as promising investments as they initially seem. Zillow has since its promised merger with Trulia been transitioning from a rapid-growth company valued on its promise into a company that is being traded at a more fundamental valuation. So even under the most aggressive growth projections it is dubious whether Zillow will be able to fulfill its share price expectations.What does the Zillow real estate ecosystem do? Its revenue stream stems from its database of homes - online residential real estate data - which offers pricing estimates, map visuals, pictures, and agent listings for homes that are listed throughout the United States. The aim of the company's business model is to connect brokers, mortgage specialists, sellers, and other real estate players to buyers through a glossy and attractive online interface. The company's main revenue source is its stable of real estate agents, although it also targets real estate buyers, lenders, and other service providers. The way that agents funnel money to Zillow is by paying listing fees (i.e. paying for their listings to be featured in search results or beside particular properties), by subscriptions, and via advertising. Premier Agent listings get particularly attractive features like dynamic photos and easily-accessible contact links. Other real estate service providers pay Zillow advertising and referral fees, although these make up a small portion of the company's revenue stream.Bulls like to point out that Zillow continues to add users at a rapid rate. In featured words in its 3Q earnings call and 3Q earnings report, ""Zillow reached a record 86 million average monthly unique users during the third quarter of 2014, up 41% year-over-year. In July, traffic broke an all-time record with nearly 89 million monthly unique users, an increase of 45% year-over-year."" But upon closer inspection Zillow's main story for investors is that it is not yet profitable and, honestly, has no near-term possibility of profitability either. The stock's trading multiples are, in spite of its general downturn over the last several months, still very high. According to Yahoo Finance, its P/S ratio (TTM) is over 14 and its P/B ratio is 7.19.Z PS Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsThe company is unprofitable and its revenue over the last year is only $291.91 M (although this does represent a substantial percentage increase over previous years).Z Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsWith a market cap of nearly $4.2 Billion, Zillow trades at a substantial premium to many of its technology-space peers.Why is Zillow so unpromising when viewed as a growth stock? One reason is that it still faces competition. Rupert Murdoch is now the owner of Zillow's last main competitor, Move Inc. (NASDAQ:MOVE), after his Australian-based News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) acquired it in recent months. Realter.com will now be the main competitor online, outside of the MLS and local broker websites, to Zillow.com and Trulia.com. Does Realter.com present a threat to Spencer Rascoff's plan for the Zillow-Trulia combined company? This situation does bear monitoring, and it will be interesting to see what Move Inc.'s new owners choose to do with it. So far there are only three countries in the world in which online listing portals like Zillow and Move have been able to generate substantive profits. These are China, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Almost certainly the real estate agents will, as a class, do to Zillow what real estate agents have done in these three countries to their online listing portals - namely, fight back by setting up alternative portals and by imposing pricing deals upon the portals that are unfavorable to the profitability of the latter. The company's earnings report will be released in mid-February and by then we should have a clearer picture of the trajectory of its competition.The main reason why Zillow is likely not to deliver compelling returns over the next couple of years is that the company's core business model is still unprofitable, even after the Trulia merger and its advertising 'pricing power.' The great majority of the company's revenues are derived from real estate players who subscribe or advertise for the sake of buyer leads. Zillow has been producing those leads by facilitating buyer web traffic with glossy photos and real estate data offerings. The problem is that Zillow has been spending so much money to generate these leads - the company's ratio of leads generated per broker customer has not really changed in the last several years. Thus, margins suffer because of inherent structural features in the company's lead-generating business model.These margin problems are exacerbated by the fact that many real estate agents do not find Zillow to be a profitable source of leads and 'churn' their subscriptions/advertising with Zillow because the company's leads do not deliver to the extent that they promise. Zillow does not disclose these agent churn rates to the investment community. Many realtors are likewise disgruntled with Zillow's Zestimates feature, which appears to be inaccurate much of the time. The point is that Zillow is not a new company and a large percentage of the real estate community in the United States has now tried its services. The absence of profitability at this point in the company's history is disconcerting and suggests structural flaws - the company is not scaling in the way that it is supposed to be doing.It is notable that Zillow insiders continue to sell the stock at a rapid rate. True, when rapid-growth tech companies are paying their executives in stock options the sensible thing is usually for those executives to diversify their stock holdings as soon as they can. At the same time, the sheer rate at which Zillow insiders have been selling - including, above all, the CEO Spencer Rascoff (who has been selling 10,000 shares every month) - and the lack of any single open-market insider purchase in the last couple of years suggests that the view of the company insiders on the company's prospects is predominately bearish. To date, company insiders have sold about $400 M worth of Zillow stock, including especially open-market stock options sales.Yet in spite of these bearish signals the prospects of a near-term investment gain is not very substantial for potential short-sellers. Is there a near-term catalyst to cause Zillow to drop from these levels? Not much, outside of some possible tax-loss selling that might be undertaken by those who purchased Zillow after its post-Trulia spike earlier this year. Nevertheless, there has been a moderate sell-off in a lot of the tech high-flyers in recent weeks, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and perhaps some of this waning interest in the high-valuation tech stocks will continue to touch Zillow as well. Shorting the high-flying technology companies has not very often been a successful strategy over the last couple of years, but perhaps if there is a general market downturn then at this point it will finally begin to pay off."
2950276,31461,2015-02-26T15:02:37-05:00,"Zillow recently closed the Trulia deal, and the merged entity is known as Zillow Group.Although competition is heating up in the real estate websites market, I believe the future prospect of Zillow Group is bright.I’d recommend buying the shares of Zillow Group at the current price.","Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), the provider of real estate and property-related information, recently closed the much-hyped acquisition of Trulia, the real estate search engine. The combined entity is known as the Zillow Group. Zillow reported record $325.9 million revenue for full-year 2014, up 65% from 2013. Based on impressive revenue growth and Trulia acquisition, Zillow Group's stock should rise significantly from the current price around $112-113. I believe the stock is a conviction buy for long-term investors.Changing Competitive LandscapeZillow Group's no.1 competitor is Realtor.com, backed by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWS)(NASDAQ:NWSA). Last year, News Corp. acquired Move Inc., the owner of Realtor.com, for $950 million to compete primarily with Zillow. News Corp. wanted to expand its business in the real estate listings market with the help of Realtor.com, when the publishing company's ad revenue growth was slowing.Although Zillow's chief executive Spencer Rascoff said that News Corp.'s acquisition of Realtor.com operator Move Inc. isn't a cause of worry for him, with Zillow's contract with News Corp. owned Listhub expiring in early April, it could lose a significant amount of listings. The question is whether Trulia's huge database of real estate listings from MLS (Multiple Listing Services) could save Zillow Group in this situation?Although Zillow has initiated a legal battle against News Corp. by filing for and subsequently receiving a temporary restraining order forcing ListHub to continue supplying listings to Trulia, I believe News Corp. will eventually win the battle since Zillow is its primary competitor and supplying listings to a competitor might not be commercially justified, even in the eyes of the court.By acquiring Trulia, Zillow has acquired six business brands - viz., Market Leader, Diverse Solutions, ActiveRain, Postlets, Retsly and Mortech - that can provide sophisticated tools to real estate agents and brokers. The tools that are available via the six sites mentioned above could help Zillow grow its business in the B2B marketplace and fight against News Corp. in this area. News Corp. offers real estate agents and brokers a rich customer relationship management platform, known as Top Producer, and a lead-generation platform, known as TigerLead.Although I believe that Trulia's database of real estate listings from MLS can certainly save Zillow to an extent, the truth is that Zillow has to develop more new and innovative tools in order to survive in an environment where a giant like News Corp. is an opponent.However, the situation is not as grim for Zillow as it seems. Why? The sheer market size and the growth opportunity in the online real estate market are huge. In a survey, 74% of home buyers answered that they would use the Internet as part of their home search, according to the National Association of Realtors. The survey further revealed that after conducting an online home search, 29% of the searchers found a real estate agent, and 21% at least drove by a home they saw online. I believe that going forward Zillow's revenue growth will taper off from the current level, but the company will continue to see reasonable growth that will be in line with the overall social advertising revenue growth.Projected Long-Term Stock Price Of Zillow GroupFor full-year 2014, Zillow's revenue was $325.9 million, which represents 65% year-over-year growth. Trulia's revenue was $235.45 million on trailing 12-month basis, up 105% year-over-year. The combined entity's yearly revenue would be around $560 million in 2015, assuming zero growth. But the revenue is expected to rise significantly in reality, although it may not be as high as last year.Social advertising revenues are estimated to grow at a CAGR of 18.6% from $4.7 billion in 2012 to $11 billion in 2017, according to U.S.-based media analyst firm BIA/Kelsey. Based on the estimate, I assume that Zillow Group's revenue will also grow at a CAGR of 18.6% up to 2017.Source: Marketing LandAt 18.6% CAGR, Zillow Group's 2017 revenue will be $934 million, or $16.26 per share (assuming 1 share of Trulia equals 0.444 share of erstwhile Zillow, which leads to 57.43 million shares outstanding for the combined entity). In the last 52 weeks Zillow has traded between the price to sales ratio of 13x and 24x, the average being 18.5x. During the same period, Trulia has traded between 6x and 11.3x in terms of price to sales ratio, the average being 8.7x. I believe it's reasonable to assume that the combination of Zillow and Trulia, i.e., the Zillow Group should then trade at the mean of the two averages, which is 13.6x. At this multiple, Zillow Group's share price should be $221, based on three-year forward revenue. Although I'm not saying that Zillow Group's stock is heading toward that level immediately, I strongly believe $221 is achievable in the long run.ConclusionDespite intensifying competition, real estate websites will continue to evolve as emerging media with tremendous opportunity to grow, not only in the Unites Sates, but in the international markets also. I believe the growth opportunity of real estate websites is similar to what travel websites saw a few years ago. Now is the time to buy Zillow Group."
2647965,22148,2014-11-07T04:44:36-05:00,Zillow reported Q3 '14 earnings.Stock remains a sell until the typical trough in early December.The seasonal slowdown in results were anticipated to impact the stock despite Q3 earnings that smashed estimates.,"Despite smashing Q314 earnings estimates, Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) slumped after-hours as the stock continues to run into typical seasonal issues in the real estate sector. The stock has slumped from a high of over $160 at the time of the Trulia (TRLA) merger announcement to after-hours trading around $95. Previous research suggests this is normal for Zillow to hit a trough around the start of December.For Q314, Zillow reported earnings of $0.13 that easily surpassed analyst estimates of $0.08. The top line of $88.6 million slightly beat estimates for $88.0 million. The online real estate marketplace saw monthly traffic records in July at 89 million unique users and an average of 86 million users for the quarter. Marketplace revenue soared 77% to a record $72.7 million and real estate revenue grew 86% to a record $65.6 million. These numbers were offset by slower growth in display ads and mortgage revenues. Zillow continues making progress growing the Premier Agents by adding over 4,000 in the quarter to a total of 60,877. The average revenue per advertiser jumped to a record of $349, up from $264 in the same period last year. The company guided to Q4 revenue in the range of $89 million to $90 million, below analyst estimates of $91 million. Even more concerning, Zillow is projecting nearly flat sequential revenue growth compared to nearly 10% growth during Q4 last year. The main culprit is an apparent slowdown in display advertising by financial institutions.The original investment thesis in the article ""Zillow: Keep An Eye Out For The Fall"" is further backed by the lack of momentum in the stock after the Q3 report. Though Zillow apparently faces a difficult short-term issue with the non-strategic display advertising business, the stock is hitting typical seasonal issues in the real estate sector. The previous research suggested that the stock typically doesn't hit a low point until early December. A further sell-off following the disappointing Q4 guidance likely sets the stock up for more weakness. With a market cap dropping below $4 billion, the stock becomes a lot more attractive heading into what should become another year of strong growth in 2015."
2740435,22148,2014-12-09T18:13:29-05:00,"Zillow continues to trade in a seasonal pattern with the real estate market.Typical seasonal user metrics has the MUUs hitting a trough now followed by a huge sequential rally in January.The stock trades at a huge forward PE ratio, but the trend suggests the stock heads higher now.","The recent user metrics released by Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) confirm the trend for the online real estate marketplace. The company continues to see strong YoY user growth, but the seasonal trends in real estate shopping caused traffic to the websites and mobile apps to plunge at the end of the year. Not surprisingly the stock tends to follow these seasonal trends.The recent rally in the stock preempted the typical lows not reached until early December, but the merger with Trulia (TRLA) has the stock acting more erratic than normal. Should investors buy the stock now for the seasonal rally into summer if they missed the early November lows?November User MetricsZillow reported that monthly unique users (MUUs) on the mobile apps and websites were 74.3 million. The MUUs were down 10.2% sequentially from 82.8 million in October. More importantly, the users were up a strong 40.7% from November 2014 levels of 52.8 million.The user metrics continue a trend of a usage trough in the November and December months followed by a big jump once the calendar flips into the next year. The last three January MUUs saw jumps from the December levels of over 32%. A similar MUUs increase for January 2015 would see usage total of over 98 million next month. Interestingly, the typical January number exceeds all of the months from the prior year. The record high now is 88.8 million users back in July 2014 so Zillow should easily soar past that number with the normal trend. Prior to the 69.9 million MUUs in January 2014, the record for Zillow was 63.7 million users in August 2013.As December progresses, investors should start looking toward a rebound in the users.Stock ActionThough investors should know these seasonal user metric trends listed above, the stock price for Zillow still tends to follow those same trends. This year the stock peaked at nearly $165 on the backs of the Trulia merger announcement in July and plunged to lows of around $95 at the start of November.Previous research recommended that investors get out of the stock in August (see What Is Keeping Zillow Sky-High?) with the stock trading at $133 and again in September (see Zillow: Keep An Eye Out For The Fall) at $130. The research found that Zillow had hit troughs in the last three years during the period from November 15 to December 4. This year, Zillow hit a low of $94.23 on November 4. The stock though closed at $99 that day and remained close to that level with a close of $102.46 on November 13 before the huge rally.The above chart shows Zillow set up for a positive trend now after the recent rally.TakeawayWhile the normal trend was slightly skewed forward a few days this year, Zillow still traded in a similar trend as the last three years. The stock now trades at a forward PE of 123 so the sharp rally was disappointing for investors looking to grab the stock at a more attractive price point with a typical sell-off on into the beginning of December.At a closing price of $117 on December 8, the stock still offers a discount to the levels of the previous warnings back in August and September. Aggressive investors will want to purchase the stock now with it trading above key technicals and appearing ready for the typical seasonal rally that gathers steam at the start of a new calendar year."
2765935,40781,2014-12-19T11:01:44-05:00,"Why after shorting shares after the proposed merger announcement, it's time to consider covering that short.Catalysts for Zillow and Trulia going forward.Technical and fundamental analysis of where these companies currently stand.","In July, I wrote an article telling investors that it was time to start selling their shares of Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and Trulia (TRLA), and that it was time to go short.Some reasons for my recommendation at the time:1) The merger talks between Zillow and Trulia put sky-high valuations on these companies that were not all that deserving.2) Although they are both great companies, Zillow and Trulia were extremely expensive, overpriced and overbought.3) Last but not least, we don't even know if the merger will go through between these two companies. Speculation can only hold shares at ridiculous levels for so long before reality sets in for investors.Why it's likely time to cover that short:1) Valuations - Shares are not as expensive as they used to be, and are not trading at ridiculous valuations. Yes, the valuations on these companies are still high, but are nothing compared to what we saw over the summer.2) Buyers Stepping Up - The markets have had some extremely bad days the last couple of months, and for the most part, Zillow and Trulia have been able to shrug off the market weakness. This tells me that sellers are drying up and that buyers are continuing to step in.3) The Favorites - No matter how overvalued a company may be, always take into consideration the law of supply and demand. Even if everybody knows the shares are overvalued, if nobody sells their shares, the price of the security remains overvalued until sellers start exiting. Also, because of the low float between both companies, shares can be extremely volatile from day to day.Even after another dismal earnings report by Zillow, in which shares briefly fell below $100, shares have since climbed more than 10%. I believe Zillow and Trulia are starting to take on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) characteristics in that no matter how bad earnings are, investors will continue to push shares higher and higher for no legitimate and fundamental reason.Good examples of this are growth and momentum players like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon. Although these companies do not have a lot in common, they do share some of the same characteristics and tendencies.Amazon lost more than $125M last quarter, yet somehow shares continue to trade at absurd valuations. For example, its Forward P/E is well over 300, more than 10-15X the valuation of most companies trading on the market today.4) Merger Decision - Each day that goes by, we are inching closer and closer to a decision on whether or not the FTC will allow the Zillow and Trulia merger to go through. Because of the requests of the FTC, the companies have stated that they don't expect the merger to take place until the first half of 2015.It is my belief that as we get closer to the ruling, shorts will continue to cover, and shares will most likely keep on climbing until the announcement is made from the FTC. At the same time, depending on how shares have responded leading up to the announcement, shares might be setting investors up for a typical ""sell the news"" event.5) A Bottomed Has Formed - Throughout October and November, a bottom looks to have been formed in the $100-$107 range for Zillow and between $40-$45 for Trulia. Looking at the charts below, we can see that shares of both companies continue to trend upwards.Mixed Earnings ReportsZillow - Although Zillow beat on both the top and bottom lines, the company still came up short on its third-quarter guidance as shares fell by more than 7%.Trulia - Things didn't get any better for Trulia, as the company missed revenue expectations by 5%, and with earnings per share coming just in line. To make matters worse, Trulia didn't provide guidance ahead of its planned merger with Zillow, so investors were left in the dark as to what they should expect and look forward to.ConclusionWith the merger approval likely to take place by the first quarter of next year, shorts will most likely start to cover in anticipation of the announcement and ruling.Also, with the markets coming back to life after tax-loss selling, the oil/Russia crisis, etc., there shouldn't be a whole lot of down days over the next couple of weeks. Based on the history of these stocks, I wouldn't want to take my chances after scoring a win for the short side.Disclaimer: LinkStock Performance Tracker: Link"
2572565,73185,2014-10-18T15:07:49-04:00,"While Zillow recently acquired competitor Trulia, Rupert Murdoch moved to buy out Zillow's last remaining competitor, Move.We have major concerns surrounding Zillow's very bearish insider sentiment, especially in the last three months.We also have major concerns surrounding Zillow's current and predicted premium valuations, especially in comparison to Move's less premium valuation multiples.Due to these concerns, we are bearish on Zillow.","There has been a lot going on in the online housing market. First, the front-runner Zillow, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) moved to acquire main competitor Trulia, Inc. (TRLA) in late July. Then, Zillow's last true competitor, Move Inc. (NASDAQ:MOVE), was acquired by Australian based and Rupert Murdoch-founded News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA).Looking forward, then, the online housing market essentially becomes a two-horse race between zillow.com and realtor.com.Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff addressed this in an interview with Mad Money's Jim Cramer. That interview piqued us to look deeper into Zillow.We weren't terribly impressed by Rascoff in the interview. It started with a slam on Move and Murdoch, saying realtor.com will become rupert.com, and it ended with a very unsure answer concerning selling the company. All in all, we got the feeling that Rascoff was rather concerned by the deep financial backing Murdoch will offer Move, and as such, not ultimately confident in his own company's future success.What we were looking for in Rascoff was confidence about Zillow and the company going forward. What we got we felt was more along the lines of attacking the competition.So we dug a little deeper.Bearish Insider SentimentIn situations where a company is experiencing weakness like Zillow (down 20% in the past month), we believe one of the key indicators of future success is the insider sentiment.We specifically pay attention to the insider buy/sell ratio, with a high buy/sell ratio implying bullish insider sentiment and a low buy/sell ratio implying bearish insider sentiment.In the past year, Zillow has a 0.20 insider buy/sell ratio. Essentially, for every share bought, five were sold. In the past three months, that figure dropped to 0.16.Digging further, we discovered there was only one buy transaction in the past 3 months - an acquisition of 30,000 shares in the non-open market by co-founder and Executive Chairman Richard Barton.Also, both in the past three months and the past year, there has been heavy sell activity from current Rascoff.All of these facts imply a very bearish insider sentiment at Zillow, which is a huge negative for us when looking into a company suffering from current weakness.Premium ValuationZillow is not a cheap stock, especially compared to its main competitor MOVE.It currently trades at a very premium valuation of nearly 16x last year's revenues, which is considerably higher than the 3.8x revenue multiple MOVE currently trades at.Zillow also trades at a 111x earnings multiple on next year's earnings - 6 times greater than the industry average earnings multiple and more than 10 times greater than the sector average earnings multiple. MOVE, on the other hand, trades at 40x earnings multiple on next year's earnings.Further, Zillow has a very high 5-year-forecasted PEG ratio of 5.68, which seems even larger compared to the industry average PEG ratio of -4.66 and sector average PEG ratio of -0.65.We aren't convinced that Zillow can grow at the rates to sustain these high valuation multiples. We do grant that the online and mobile home-buying business is primed for great growth, but the industry average multiples seem to be appropriately aligned with this growth. Zillow's multiples, though, which dwarf the industry average multiples, seem slightly outrageous.We are further discouraged by the fact that Zillow's last true competitor, MOVE, has deep financial backing and lower valuation multiples more in line with industry averages.What the Technicals SayTo examine the momentum of Zillow and Move, we turn to a technical analysis of the stocks.Z data by YChartsWe see that Zillow has fallen below its 20- and 50-day EMAs since Murdoch acquired Move. Its RSI index has tumbled close to the 30-fear barrier as well. We also see that the only time the stock traded dramatically above its 20- and 50-day EMAs was in the days following news of the Trulia acquisition. This strength in stock price, however, was short lived, and within days, the stock traded right in line with its EMAs. Examining the short, the weakness suffered from Murdoch's acquisition of Move has had much more longevity.On the other hand, Move has jumped above its 20- and 50-day EMAs, and its RSI index has broken the generally accepted 70-overbought barrier.Long story short: Zillow is experiencing weakness while Move is experiencing strength. Usually, that makes Zillow a very interesting long candidate for us. However, we require a catalyst to jump-start the weakness turnaround.Given Zillow's bearish insider sentiment, already premium valuation, lack of longevity of stock strength during Trulia acquisition, and fear-driven technicals, we don't believe Zillow has a turnaround story in the near-term.ConclusionA not-so-confident interview by a CEO who needed to display utmost confidence, a strong bearish insider sentiment including heavy sell-offs by the CEO to support the CEO's ostensible lack of confidence, an already premium valuation that values the company at multiples far greater than industry and sector averages, and technicals that imply weakness sum together to create one too many reasons for us not to like this stock going forward.We aren't entirely sure where the stock will go from here. But we wouldn't be surprised if the downward momentum continues."
2684195,52712,2014-11-14T18:52:12-05:00,"Zillow has fallen substantially from its highs following its announced merger with Trulia.The short thesis still holds but there is less margin of safety compared to when the stock was at $140.We closed our short position given our price target was achieved.Zillow's user growth and engagement is impressive, however this has yet to flow to net income.","Situation: Recently we wrote an article describing how Zillow (NAZ)was a prime short candidate (The Zillow Short Instruction Manual). Since we published our short thesis, we were proven correct, with the stock hitting our $100 price target within a few months. We have closed our short position given the enormous margin of safety is now gone in our view. If Zillow executes perfectly it could be valued close to its current stock price and grow into its valuation. However when we shorted the stock earlier when it was in the $140 range, we felt there was no way for the stock to ever timely reach that valuation.Why We Shorted Zillow Originally:Source: AuthorWhat Has Changed Since We Shorted Zillow:Other than that all the other reasons we originally shorted Zillow have remained, including continued insider selling (or should we say dumping). Recently, Greg Schwartz, Chief Revenue Officer, sold more shares at $105.75 per share, leaving him owning zero shares beneficially after the transaction, indicating he views little upside from current levels. We view the Trulia and Zillow merger as a positive, given there was limited differentiation of the two companies. Additionally, the companies are projected to achieve $100 million in cost savings by 2016. However, the increased pricing power assumption has been challenged by the Realogy exclusivity agreement. This agreement for those who are not aware prohibits other agencies for advertising on Realogy listings and gives Realogy a price 95% less than what other agencies pay. This could function to minimize the Trulia and Zillow mega site, as other agencies may demand similar pricing concessions and limit Zillow's ability to not only raise prices but maintain current levels.Stock Is Moving Higher On Short Covering On 11/14: Given Zillow's high short interest, the stock frequently has large moves in its stock price with little data or new information being released. Shorts have various prices at which to cover and once these price limits are triggered, an 11% move in the stock can occur with nothing new material to the business happening. This is another reason we decided to close our short once we made a nice profit: the stock is a volatility storm.Sell Side Analysts Biased: Michael Graham of Cannacord maintained a buy on Zillow with a $125 price target, however this is a biased price target as Cannacord has been involved with Zillow's previous financings and a portion of his compensation is linked to underwriting fees. Additionally, he lowered his price target from $150 to $125 within a few months as soon as the stock moved lower. Thus we would not stake a long position based on his research or other sell side reports as they are inherently biased and are contantly revised.Revenue Growth Is Being Purchased With Little Operating Leverage: Zillow's sales and marketing expenses have been consistently increasing as they pay to move users to their online and mobile platforms (see below). Their sales and marketing have not only been increasing on an absolute basis but has been increasing relative to revenue at a very rapid clip. This contrasts to other fast growing dual marketplaces such as Linkedin (LNKD) which have much lower sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenue, and have been able to keep this percent relatively constant. We see this as evidence that Zillow is essentially buying users and that there are little network effects inherent to the business, as opposed to Linkedin. Despite this major difference between the two businesses, Zillow is valued in line with LinkedIn in terms of financial multiples - we feel this is a lack of understanding of Zillow's business model.Source: Zillow 10-QSource: Author Analysis, Zillow FinancialsSource: Author Analysis, Linkedin FinancialsUpdated Valuation: Using comparable high growth internet companies (removing Trulia from the comps), a mean enterprise value to revenue of seven was obtained. Given Zillow's strong top line growth a multiple of eight times was applied. We assumed share issuances going forward and used forty two million for the outstanding shares count. Using aggressive revenue growth and a premium multiple a price of $88 was computed. Note however that any slowdown in revenue or growth concerns could send the stock much lower than this price target, but in a conservative manner we are assuming the high growth continues and is valued at a premium multiple.Source: Author AnalysisConclusion: Overall the 40% short interest in Zillow is justified given several of the original points to our short thesis are still present. However, given the large margin of safety we need in order to initiate a short position, we are no longer short the shares after the stock has fallen from its highs. Shorts should continuously examine the margin of safety in their positions, especially when dealing with technology equities which can stay irrational for long periods."
2698035,55442,2014-11-21T07:30:00-05:00,"At the Ira Sohn conference, Caledona portfolio manager Michael Messara suggested Zillow could be worth $770 per share citing comparisons to online realty websites in the UK and Australia.However, there are significant structural differences between the UK/Australian and US markets, notably the absence of buyers' agents and absence of the MLS system.Leading UK real estate website Rightmove an indispensable asset to real estate agents in the UK (as evidenced by 90% of agents being paying customers of Rightmove with minimal churn).By contrast, less than 10% of agents in the US are paying customers of Zillow. Churn, while undisclosed, is estimated to be high.Author estimates that even with a successful integration of Trulia, Zillow has 50+% downside.","Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) shares have surged over 20% since the company reported a disappointing third quarter two weeks ago. Shares were up as much as 7% on Wednesday following commentary from Caledonia portfolio manager Michael Messara who suggested that Zillow could grow to become a $50 billion company. While anything is possible, after reviewing Messara's commentary, there are several problems with his analysis. In this article, I will shed light on these areas and attempt to determine Zillow's fair value.Messara believes that Zillow is in the early stages of monetizing a massive growth opportunity. In this Bloomberg Interview, he highlights the reasons he believes Zillow's shares are poised for a substantial rise including:First, let's have a look at the numbers. Here is historical data of revenue and EBITDA for Rightmove (dominant player in UK), REA (dominant player in Australia), and Zillow:Looking at the data above, it is a fact that both Rightmove and REA were able to grow at high rates while generating tremendous levels of profitability. This is in stark contrast to Messara's comments in the Bloomberg interview, where he stated that Rightmove and REA went through similar periods of investment. Rightmove, which was created in 2000 and was profitable within two years and generating 46% operating margins within six years. Zillow was launched 9 years ago and is still producing operating losses. These vast differences in financial results suggest structural reasons in the markets in which these companies operate.The largest problem with Messara's analysis is that there are significant structural differences in the way homes are transacted in Australia/UK versus the US. This has resulted in Zillow and Trulia using a completely different business model than Rightmove and REA. The first important difference is that nearly all buyers in the US use real estate agents to assist in purchasing a home, whereas this is rare in the UK/Australia. In the US, it is a convention of the marketplace for the seller's agent to split the commission (the entire commission is paid by seller) with the buyer's agent. However, in the UK/Australia, very few homebuyers use agents and those who do pay the agent out of their own pocket. The second major difference is that the US has a centralized database of homes on the market, which is available to all realtors called the Multiple Listing Service (MLS). This system is unique to the US and does not exist in the UK or Australia (where Rightmove and REA thrive).A buyer's agent and the MLS negates the Zillow/Trulia value proposition. When a prospective homebuyer in the US becomes somewhat serious about purchasing a home, the buyer enlists an agent to assist the process. The agent will typically do the following: 1) use the MLS database to create an up-to-date list of properties meeting the buyer's criteria which the buyer can access online (has pictures and data similar to a Zillow listing) (2) arrange for a home viewing with the seller's agent (3) accompany the prospective buyer to the viewing and advise the buyer in negotiation (4) suggest an attorney, home inspector, mortgage broker, etc., to help the buyer close on the transaction.Let's compare the US system to the Australian/UK system (the UK and Australian systems are very similar). In these markets, the buyer will use Rightmove's website to find a home (as the buyer has no agent to do this on his behalf). Through information found on Rightmove's site, the buyer will contact the seller's agent and arrange to see the home. This is a significant difference - in the UK/Australia, the primary method by which homebuyers find properties to purchase and make contact with the seller's agent is through Rightmove (REA in Australia). Thus, Rightmove is an indispensable asset for the seller's agent in finding buyers. This is evidenced by the fact that over 90% of real estate agents in the UK are paying customers of Rightmove (vs. less than 10% of US real estate agents are paying customers of Zillow and churn is estimated to be high at 30-40%). By contrast, in the US, while prospective homebuyers may surf around on Zillow and Trulia, the information to contact the seller's agent is generally not featured on the page (and even if it were, the buyer would contact his own agent, not the seller's agent). So even in an instance where a US homebuyer surfs around on Zillow and decides to view the property, the buyer calls the buyer's agent and generates 0 revenue for Zillow.These differences forced Zillow and Trulia to develop a completely different business model than REA or Rightmove. REA and Rightmove are paid an annual subscription fee by agents to be able to access the system (display their listings). In the UK, over 90% of agents pay Rightmove. By contrast, less than 10% of agents in the US are customers of Zillow. ¾ of Zillow's revenue from agents comes from selling the space next to the listing to the highest bidder (rather than recurring subscription fees). The agent pictured next to the listing is usually not the listing agent and has no special information about the property. Agents pay to be featured next to properties to generate leads of prospective buyers who have not yet selected an agent. By definition, these are less serious buyers than buyers who have already selected an agent to help them. While Zillow does not disclose churn, as mentioned above, it is estimated to be 30-40% (vs. sub 5% at Rightmove).While what I have described above may seem to be a subtle point, it is actually a major structural difference, which I believe goes a long way to explaining why Zillow is unable to generate an operating profit 8-9 years into its existence while REA and Rightmove were solidly profitable much earlier in their corporate lives. Thus, I believe it is wholly inappropriate to draw conclusions about Zillow's future profitability from looking at the profitability of Rightmove and REA.In order to garner a larger share of the pie, Zillow would need to do something truly disruptive - such as eliminating the use of buyers' agents in the US and get paid directly by sellers' agents on a subscription basis to help them find buyers. There are several problems with trying to do this, most notably all agents act sometimes as buyer's agents and sometimes as seller's agents (and when lucky, agents act as both). Thus, a campaign to eliminate buyers' agents would alienate all agents - putting Zillow in conflict with its customer base (also there just doesn't seem to be much impetus to do this in the market).Factoring in the merger with Trulia but assuming no paradigm shift in Zillow's business model, I believe what follows is a fair valuation for Zillow:This assumes that the company is able to achieve its full cost synergy target. It further assumes that Zillow/Trulia is able to increase prices ~12% and that the entire price hike flows through to operating profit. Beyond this, I optimistically assume that the incremental margin is ~25% (which is a big improvement vs. history). By 2016, it is likely that the period of super-normal growth has ended and that the company is growing 10-15%, which causes me to put a 23x P/E multiple on the business. The resulting sell price of $56 is more than 50% below Wednesday's close. This is up significantly from the $14/share I valued Zillow at earlier this year - the entire increase is driven by the synergies of merging with Trulia."
2546865,22148,2014-10-07T15:18:08-04:00,Zillow reported September user metrics.The stock is more attractive but investors shouldn't rush into it until the bottoming out process runs its course.The typical weak sequential user metrics were anticipated to lead these normal seasonal stock declines.,"Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) reported that September 2014 user metrics declined. The online real estate marketplace leader typically sees a seasonal slowdown after peaking during the summer real estate selling season each year. The stock ended the previous day at multi-month lows slightly below $110, down from a peak around $164.The company reported that monthly unique users (MUUs) dropped to 82.8 million during September from 86.3 million in August. The numbers were a 42% increase from the 63.7 million users in the prior year period. The YoY growth in MUUs is mostly inline with the average of around 40% growth in the last few months. The numbers over the last two months provide a unique picture with MUUs peaking in July at 88.8 million, compared to the typical annual peak in August. The sequential decline from August to September was slightly smaller than normal at only 4%, but the decrease from the peak in July of 6.8% is more inline with expectations.The data continues to back the investment thesis in the article ""Zillow: Keep An Eye Out For The Fall"" that investors should avoid the stock until the typical trough in early December. Despite the common knowledge of declining users after the peak selling season, investors appear unable to focus on the YoY growth of over 40% MUUs. The market cap has now dropped below $4 billion prior to the Trulia (TRLA) merger actually bringing it into a more attractive valuation trading at less than 10x forward revenue. Investors should remain patient and allow the stock to bottom out towards the end of November before jumping into it."
2533005,22148,2014-10-01T03:18:28-04:00,News Corp buys competitor Move pressuring the stock of Zillow.Zillow's stock remains an avoid until the typical seasonal swoon ends by early December.The news contributes to the original thesis that the news cycle after the Summer selling season tends to turn negative.,"The news of the day on Tuesday sent Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) down to lows not seen in a couple of months. The stock that originally popped to $165 on the news of the deal to buy Trulia (TRLA) hit a low of $112 yesterday. The online real estate marketplace stock continues to crater following the irrational run back during the Spring as other high-flying stocks fell.News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS) (NASDAQ:NWSA) agreed to buy Move (NASDAQ:MOVE) for $21, or $950 million. The deal offers a 37% premium over the previous closing price. News Corp will own 80% of the company with REA Group owning the other 20%. News Corp correctly suggests that realtor.com run by Move has the best real estate information, but it doesn't address how it will change the lack of user engagement. The company faces an uphill battle in getting the user base of 31 million monthly unique users to catch up to the nearly 89 million users that visited Zillow during July. Combined with the users visiting Trulia, Zillow controls a likely insurmountable lead over Move and realtor.com.My original investment thesis in the article ""Zillow: Keep An Eye Out For The Fall"" continues to come to fruition. In the limited time of being a public company, Zillow's stock continues to fall towards yearly lows in the time period between now and early December. The typical peak in the housing market during the Summer and the fears of a more competitive Move will set the stock up for a prime buying opportunity for the long term in a few months. Remember that News Corp is the company that ran MySpace into the ground and no reason exists for realtor.com as part of a large media conglomerate to successfully compete against the lean Zillow, especially after combined with Trulia."
2543695,71765,2014-10-06T15:45:36-04:00,"Potential merger deal between Zillow and Trulia worth $2.9 billion.The merger awaits approval from the antitrust enforcers from the Federal Trade Commission.Should the deal be approved, Zillow will become the market leader in online real estate marketing.The share prices surged in the market after the announcement of the merger, but slid down to their lower levels after the company missed its earnings target in August.Analysts issued an average hold rating for the shares.","The merger between the two online real estate listing portals could lead to the creation of one of the most dominant and powerful portals on the internet. The potential merger deal, which is valued at $2.9 billion, still waits the approval of antitrust enforcers at the Federal Trade Commission, which made its second request for information in order to examine the deal before approving it. It is expected that the entire approval process could take a few months, which means that there is some time before the deal actually falls through.The two portals have been dominating the real estate online listing market for quite some time and are noted as the top visited websites by home buyers. In July, Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) received 57.7 million visitors while Trulia (TRLA) received 35.8 million visitors. These portals generate income from the commission received by real-estate agents, while Trulia also engages in software selling to agents.Some real-estate agents have expressed their concerns over the potential merger claiming that it could lead to a rise in advertising prices on their websites.The announcement of this merger had lead to a surge in share prices of Zillow shares in the market, causing it to reach an all time high of $160, mainly because of the positives that are expected to come out of the deal. The deal anticipates maintaining separate portals rather than incorporating them into one, so that even after the merger, both the portals can continue to post growth and capture sizable shares of the market without having to suffer from the potential downfalls of a merger.Zillow is expected to become the market leader in the online real estate market after the merger, which explains the surge in share price after the announcement of this deal. However, the story doesn't just end there for Zillow since it relies on professionals to post advertisements on its portal. At the same time, other websites and portals are trying to penetrate into niche markets that could allow them to compete with the giant, even after the merger. This suggests that success for Zillow isn't really assured.Zillow shares in the market and its financial resultsFollowing the surge in share prices, the company's shares don't seem to be doing too well on the exchange. For the month of August, the share fluctuated around the $140 mark and the share fell below that price by the end of the first week of September. Share prices continue to slide lower and fell to as low as $123. Till now, the shares of the company have not fallen below the $110 mark since May 12, 2014. Should share prices slide even further, it could result in a new low for the share for the current year.The share's experienced a decline in the market for the month of August on account of missing the earnings target. Although the company had been reporting an increase in the online real estate market, it posted a loss of 5 cents per share, while revenues increase by 68% year on year, and were reported at $78.7 million. The adjusted EBITDA was reported at $6.2 million which was higher than the year ago quarter's EBITDA.The company has said that it expects its third quarter revenue to be at least $87 million-$88 million, and adjusted EBTIDA to lie between $14 million to $15 million.Analyst RatingsEarlier this month, analysts issued ratings for Zillow's shares and the average recommendation received was of 'hold'. Six analysts rated the share as 'hold' and four rated it as 'buy'. The average price target for the share was set at $139.Stephens rated the share as 'overweight', while Deutsche Bank rated the share as 'hold', setting a price target of $115 per share. Benchmark Co. raised their target price for the share to $190.ConclusionFor the time being it seems as though the major story in Zillow's books is its potential merger with Trulia. Should the merger be approved by the Federal Trade Commission, it could be a very huge gain for the company, especially because it has strategically planned a way of not suffering from the potential downfalls that tend to creep up after a merger.The approval of the merger could take several months, as mentioned before and the decision could sway either way. Which is why, for now investors would find it beneficial to hold their shares if they own them. For those who are waiting for an opportunity to buy the shares, the best time would be when there is some kind of news related to the merger that gets to the surface. Until then, the weak results for Zillow are less than impressive and its rally in the stock exchange doesn't present itself as the ideal investment opportunity for investors."

The one thing that many people in the investment community seem to be forgetting about Zillow is that the fact that Zillow's stock price has been incredibly high for a number of months now does not by any means mean that it deserves this valuation. Habit breeds complacency, and the habit of waking up each morning and seeing Zillow's stock still selling at elevated levels has, I suspect, lulled many bullish investors into a false sense of safety. The purpose of this article is to remind us of these realities, so that the investing community does not lose track of how expensive Zillow's stock still is at this time.Z data by YChartsThe Bull CaseFirst, let's look at the bull case. The bull case for Zillow rests on the way in which the housing crisis stunted the growth of the online real estate world. The bursting of the real estate bubble ensured that the marketing of real estate would not move to the Internet until housing once again began to be perceived as a growing field of business. Today, as a result, the online real estate market is still incredibly fragmented and localized. Numerous local websites - websites whose purview is restricted to particular metropolitan areas - still dominate the world of online real estate. Housing lags far behind other major life areas that long ago moved online. Zillow's claim to fame (and a major reason why it trades at such expensive multiples) is that it will be the online operator that finally consolidates the fragmentation and moves real estate onto the Internet.Anecdotally, as a way of supporting the bull case, I happen to have known a number of persons who were just initiating their housing search and who, not being aware of the existence of agency-specific websites, turned first to Zillow's easy user interface. They were especially attracted to Zillow's rating system for schools and school districts (I have not checked recently, but the last time I checked, Zillow did not provide crime statistics in the way the Trulia (TRLA) does). So even if it does not always do so well at generating actionable leads, nevertheless, as a first-view way of giving real estate buyers the lay of the land, Zillow appears to be a successful enterprise.Also important for Zillow bulls are the numerous ways in which they envision the Zillow platform being integrated into other large (and prosperous) web platforms. For instance, as a possible avenue for future development, it would make sense for Zillow to tap into the continued strength of the social media movement by signing contracts with companies like Facebook and Yelp, and somehow integrating its housing listings into the advertising platforms that are afforded by the growing user bases at these companies.The Bear CaseThere are several troubling trends that are at the heart of the bear case. The key statistic that Zillow does not provide to the public is the churn rate of its advertising real estate agents. In the estimation of SA contributor Srinivasa Selvan, it is nearly 38%. Even if the churn rate turns out to be much less than this number - and I doubt that it is - this would suggest that Zillow does not offer real estate agents all that much in terms of quality leads. The way in which Zillow sells the premier agent program to real estate agents is by cold calling them - in a way and to an extent that has greatly increased Zillow's S&M expenses in recent years. Zillow has long been criticized by bears like Andrew Left for increasing its spending on S&M at a greater rate than the increase in its overall revenue. At any rate, the point is that large numbers of the real estate agents who are operating in the United States have undoubtedly now tried Zillow and, finding it less helpful than they initially assumed, moved on to other marketing opportunities. Zillow's sales and marketing costs were +120% in 2013.Z Sales and Marketing Expense (Annual) data by YChartsThe second troubling trend is related to the first, and is that Zillow has been operating for eight years now, and in spite of its extraordinary revenue growth, has yet to turn a profit.Z Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsZ Sales and Marketing Expense (Annual) data by YChartsIn order to obtain real pricing power, and not merely the Wall Street fiction of perceived pricing power, Zillow is very much in need of alternative advertising revenue streams as a supplement to its three major current revenue streams. These current revenue streams are (1) Selling leads and advertisements to real estate brokers or the premier agent program, (2) selling leads and advertisements to mortgage companies on Zillow Marketplace, and (3) Zillow's display ads program. Perhaps Zillow could supplement the real estate-focused advertisements of its third major revenue source, its display ads program, with alternative kinds of advertisements. Perhaps such streams could come from businesses or other enterprises that would benefit from consumers moving to particular neighborhoods or particular parts of metropolitan areas. Examples of potential advertisers might include private schools (since Zillow already has a school rating system), housing servicers and maintenance personnel, retailers, and other local sources of advertising. Surely something, at any rate, could be done to enhance the growth of Zillow's display ads program, because right now it constitutes less than 20% of Zillow's overall revenue - a number that has declined substantially from its near-40% portion of revenue in early 2011. It is, of course, important for the investment community to remember that Zillow's revenue does not come from advertising homes, but rather (primarily) from real estate agents paying for leads so that they can come into contact with potential home buyers and sellers.A third troubling trend is that Zillow (and Trulia) does not appear to be taking online eyeball market share away from competitors at nearly the rate at which many people in the investment community think that it is doing. Currently, less than 15% of all real estate web traffic is routed through Zillow. Because of the continued fragmentation of the American real estate market, a much greater amount of real estate web traffic is directed toward local MLS listings than toward national websites like Zillow and Trulia. Perhaps, in part, this is because stale listing data is still a problem in many metropolitan markets for Zillow. Presumably, the hope of Zillow management is that the more that brokers begin paying to market their properties online, the more that Zillow's stale listings problem will resolve itself. Nevertheless, at the same time the company does appear to be grossly - and intentionally - overcounting its monthly unique users (MUUs). This is because it counts visits from mobile, laptop, and desktop devices all as MUUs. Surely there are large numbers of persons - millions, perhaps - who frequent Zillow from multiple such devices. This is evidenced by the fact that, as SA contributor Ojasvi Rajpal has pointed out, ""for every home sale in America, approximately… 40 unique visitors visit Zillow's website.""Finally, no self-respecting inspection of the troubling trends at Zillow ought to leave out the extraordinary amount of insider selling which Zillow executives have been undertaking over the last couple of years. CEO Spencer Rascoff has led the charge, and, in spite of his ostentatious stock pumping efforts on CNBC and elsewhere, has been selling his Zillow shares as fast as he possibly can do without spooking the market.ConclusionMy own view is that Zillow is grossly overvalued, and for this reason, I am short the name, even though I do not see on the near horizon a catalyst to drive the stock lower. The euphoria of the Zillow-Trulia merger has now been fading for several weeks, and the investment community appears - at least judging by the behavior of Zillow's stock price - to be much less impressed by the merger than was initially the case in the weeks immediately following its announcement. Yet, as mentioned, the stock does still seem to have staying power at a very high multiple.In my view, homes are very large and illiquid purchases, and it is doubtful, in my opinion, that Americans will at any time in the near future be foregoing the use of real estate agents to do a lot of the technical details of home purchasing on their behalf. Real estate agents are here to stay. That is, the size of average home purchases as a percentage of Americans' income and the lack of liquidity in the real estate market (in comparison to other assets) together mean that most Americans will not be trying to use websites like Zillow at any time in the near future to take their housing purchases into their own hands. As such, Zillow appears still to be dependent upon the good graces of the established real estate community - and especially on the willingness of the members of that community to participate in Zillow's advertising plans. My own view is bearish on Zillow, and I think that Zillow will likely continue indefinitely into the future to be dependent upon the willingness of real estate agents to supply it with revenue in their own quest for marketing opportunities."
2538725,21950,2014-10-03T10:06:34-04:00,"Zillow has faded as expected after the initial excitement over its acquisition of Trulia.Current trading levels are doubly critical given a roundtrip back to a pre-deal valuation and a test of a critical uptrend line, creating a short-term trading opportunity.News Corp's acquisition of Move, Inc. may also dampen the market's overall willingness to discount heavily the risks involved in the Zillow-Trulia deal and business.","At the end of July, I panned the market's willingness to increase the valuations on both Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and Trulia (TRLA) after the two companies agreed to merge. I argued that the market was mispricing execution risk versus the stated benefits of the merger, and I targeted Zillow to return to its price point before the rumor of the deal broke out. It took about six weeks for that process to play out, including a strong technical bounce when Zillow completed the roundtrip.Post-deal excitement fades and generates a critical test of the 200-day moving average uptrendThe next technical test for Zillow has arrived at the 200-day moving average (DMA) depicted above. I have taken this opportunity to switch from bearish to bullish for another bounce given the stock market is overall oversold. However, I think the continued sell-off in Zillow below the price point ahead of the Trulia deal is a bearish development for the stock and could suggest that the market is ready to discount more risk into the valuation. As the market gets more time and distance from a deal like this, the opportunity to examine more deeply and take into consideration context can erode premiums. Impatience can also settle in - recall that Zillow has forecast a payoff period for this deal over two years. That is an eternity in internet time. For example, Zillow initially reacted negatively to the news of News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) acquiring competitor Move, Inc (NASDAQ:MOVE).When News Corp announced a $950M take-out of Move, Inc, the market promptly rewarded NWSA with a 2.7% loss and the selling has not stopped.The market accelerates its selling after news of the MOVE dealSource for charts: FreeStockCharts.comThe market's reaction to the MOVE deal - completing the roundtrip from the excitement over February's earnings - is telling since NWSA did not pay anything close to the valuation Zillow paid for Trulia or anything close to the valuation of Zillow itself. MOVE currently has a post-deal valuation of 3.6 price-to-sales and 7.9 price-to-book. It has no earnings over the past 12 months, but it does have a projected forward P/E of 40.3 (from Yahoo! Finance). I am assuming that the market fears NWSA may be over-reaching in its attempt to diversify away from its traditional print business so soon after it split off from 21st Century Fox.Based on the valuation of the MOVE deal, it is also interesting to wonder whether the market would have reacted so violently to the upside in response to the expensive Zillow-Trulia deal.When Zillow announced the acquisition of Trulia, the combined value of the companies went from $6.5B to $8.7B (compare that to NWSA's current market cap of $9B). They are now worth 6.34B combined. So, from a valuation perspective, the Zillow deal has also made a roundtrip in valuation - meaning current trading levels are doubly critical on top of the technical levels shown above.Be careful out there!"
2422935,22148,2014-08-14T11:37:49-04:00,Ability to consolidate and dominate a large online market kept Zillow's stock at highs.The purchase of Trulia introduces extra risks.Zillow might have seen the highs for now.,"Earlier in the year, when all of the social media and high-flying stocks crashed, one notable stock soared to new all-time highs. The move by online real estate leader Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) was made despite valuation multiples most consider extremely expensive.Unlike most of the social media brethren, Zillow posted a Q114 earnings beat that was actually in the black. At the time, analysts expected the company to generate a solid profit for the year, evidently making all the difference to investors willing to push the stock trading in the $80s when social media stocks collapsed up to $140 by July.The real estate sector is in the peak summer selling season, so it probably helps push the stock higher with monthly metrics soaring as the move to the Internet transpires. Of course, the merger with Trulia Inc. (TRLA) helped create the final spike to $160, but Move, Inc. (NASDAQ:MOVE) expects to have a say in that ultimate leadership position in real estate. The current metrics continue to suggest Zillow was pulling away without a deal for Trulia so does the consolidation justify the sky-high price?Consolidating The Industry  Probably because of the housing crisis, the online real estate market is far from fully developed. The industry that calls for easy access for consumers to real estate listings and other ancillary services related to a home is far behind the travel industry, stock trading, and other sectors that migrated to the Internet in full force a long time ago. Now the real estate industry is rapidly moving online, and especially to mobile.Prior to the Trulia deal, Zillow appeared poised to be the one that consolidated the industry anyway. The revenue estimates for 2014 only place Zillow a fraction ahead of both Trulia and Move, at around $320 million to just over $250 million for the laggards. The real difference is the trajectory of the growth rates that has Zillow growing the fastest in 2015 and further pulling ahead.Maybe the most important metric, Zillow saw record traffic in Q2 at 81.1 million monthly unique users, or MUUs, followed by 89.0 million in July. The surging traffic is leading premier agent subscribers to spend more. For Q2, these agents spent $54 more this year than in the same quarter of 2013. The number reached $320 this quarter.Trulia saw a record as well in Q214, but the company remains far behind Zillow at only 51.6 million MUU. The user base grew by 48% from last year's levels, trailing the 49% of the larger Zillow. For July, the MUUs jumped to 57.0 million. The news, though, turns bad when looking at Trulia's stand-alone traffic, which excludes the users from the Market Leader acquisition, with the audience growing substantially slower.At the same time, Move continues to celebrate that realtor.com saw the greatest monthly traffic in its history during March, with only 33 million MUU. The site averaged 312 million MUUs during Q214. The site is quickly becoming a distant third with revenue only growing 7%, having long been surpassed by the two more aggressive and modern real estate marketplaces.Growing The MarketplaceThe intriguing potential in Zillow moves beyond attracting the advertising budgets of agents to the ability to sell add on services for consumers looking to buy a house. The mortgage revenue grew 45% to reach a record of $7.1 million in Q1, but it contracted to only $6.6 million in Q2. The marketplace processed 5.5 million loan requests and saw reviews of lenders reach over 75,000. The numbers were solid considering the weak mortgage market, but not eye-popping considering the company grew revenue by 68% as a whole. Peak selling season occurs during spring and summer seasons, so the growth in this category will be interesting to watch during the third quarter.Bottom LineZillow avoided the carnage of social media and other high-flying stocks because of the growing realization that the company had the ability to consolidate the real estate market single-handedly. Not only was Zillow pulling away from the competition of Trulia and Move, but the company also generated a small profit to start the year.Now with the deal to buy Trulia, the combined company is worth around $7.3 billion and trades at nearly 13x revenue estimates for this year. The stock was originally sky-high, based on the ability to consolidate the leading online real estate marketplace leading to a much higher valuation down the road as a stand-alone entity. Now it appears that some of the upside is capped and the company faces integration issues that could stall stock appreciation. In addition, the move to create an industry leader amongst the upstart players in the industry could cause a backlash by agents not wanting a new entrant in the business to control so much market share.The previous tailwind keeping Zillow sky-high appears like a headwind now.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in Z over the next 72 hours.

        The Question Remains Though What If Anything Will Cause Stock To Correct To Reasonable Valuation?","Situation: Zillow is humorously valued even compared to its high growth internet peer group. Zillow trades at 148 times forward earnings versus the 76 median forward earnings of its comparable companies. The competitive moats around Zillow are mostly its userbase and its IP does not seem to be a large barrier to entry. Our full powerpoint presentation is available here. The only element which has since changed in our argument is comparing Zillow to Trulia, as they now are planning a merger. We are still short Zillow, and it the largest short in our book. However, earnings do not seem to correct the stock like other stock. For instance our largest long Chegg went up 25% post earnings, earnings generally function as catalyst but with Zillow guidance is beatable and it does not correct.What Does Zillow Do? Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) operates the leading real estate and home-related information marketplaces on mobile and the Web, with a complementary portfolio of brands and products that help people find vital information about homes and connect with local professionals. In addition to their living database of homes, accessible on Zillow.com, they also own and operate Zillow Mobile, their suite of home-related mobile applications; Zillow Mortgage Marketplace, where borrowers connect with lenders to find loans and get competitive mortgage rates; Zillow Digs, a home improvement marketplace where consumers can find visual inspiration and local cost estimates; Zillow Rentals, a marketplace and suite of tools for rental professionals; Postlets; Diverse Solutions; Agentfolio; Mortech; HotPads and StreetEasy.Insider Selling: Insider selling has been enormous at this company, with the chief revenue officer even selling shares post public announcement of the merger. However, the market does not seem to care even as executives dump shares into the general public the stock price does not correct, thus it does not seem a viable catalyst for the short thesis to play out.Catalysts:-Insider Sales(Not working as catalyst)-Market Downturn(This could work, as zillow is likely to sell-off harder then general market given its lofty valuation)-Earnings(The problem is guidance is conservative and company has history of meeting metrics, so even with an insane valuation the stock does not seem to correct, although any miss will likely send shares crashing. Shorts also have to wait some time now for next earnings release)-Increased competition via existing companies or venture-backed competitors(still possible but harder given the scale of these two companies with merger)-Real estate, mortgage and rental professionals or other advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending on Zillow(This is one still possible catalyst as many companies have there own listing services, however Zillow just had strong top line growth so they have been able to continue to extract revenue)Bull Case Offers Limited Upside:Bull Case assuming high net income growth increasing to $210 million by 2018 and a 5% LT growth rate and lower discount rate of 9%(discount to peer group), we obtain a $130 price target. A discount to the current stock price, offering long investors no upside.Key Risk Factors: The largest risk factor is that the short squeeze takes the stock to $170, completely ignoring any conventional valuation. Other risk factor is that ARPU and margins improve without any flaws and revenue growth continues at light speed and despite its lofty valuation the stock never corrects because the company continues to produce strong results. We view this scenario as unlikely given increased competition, in our view the unsustainable competitive advantage, and insiders selling shares with their detailed knowledge of companies growth potential. Even if this occurs we feel the upside(short's downside) is limited given where the stock is already trading.Disclosure: The author is short Z.

2924406,22148,2015-02-18T19:34:00-05:00,"Zillow surprised the market by reporting Q4'14 earnings after the market close on Friday while not providing numbers for Trulia.Notification of FTC approval allows for closure of the Trulia merger on Feb. 17.With the jump in the stock price, investors should look for a dip after the closing of the merger to buy Zillow prior to the normal seasonal gains.","In an odd move, Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) released Q4 earnings after the close last Friday. At the same time, the company announced that the Trulia (TRLA) merger is expected to close on Feb. 17 following notification of the Federal Trade Commission closing its investigation. The other interesting part is that the company doesn't plan to have a quarterly earnings call, rather deciding to have a call on Feb. 18 to discuss the closing of the acquisition. The lack of quarterly earnings from Trulia also is noteworthy and concerning.The stock jumped to over $115 on the news, but investors appear concerned about the lack of information about the combined new entity. Regardless, the trend in the real estate market starts turning bullish as the calendar turns each year and heads toward the spring and summer selling seasons.Quarterly TrendsThe quarterly results for Zillow are difficult to analyze considering the lack of information from Trulia. Analysts forecast Trulia accounting for roughly 43% of the combined entities' 2015 revenue of around $779 million, so their financials are crucial to any investment analysis. Whether or not Trulia met the target of nearly $68 million in Q4 revenue without any interruptions from the merger is key to any investment decision.The quarterly revenue and user metrics of Zillow were strong and continue the trend of the real estate marketplace exiting December heading into the seasonal growth period. Investors can read about the trends in the article ""Zillow: Prepare For The January Trend.""Zillow reported that Q4 revenue surged 58% to $92.3 million on the backs of December MUUs (monthly unique users) reaching 77 million. As with past trends, MUUs tend to hit a trough in November/December each year with a corresponding large jump in January. Zillow reported on its website that January MUUs increased to 86.4 million to nearly match the peaks from the prior summer, typical of normal seasonal trends and annual growth. The amount of users only grew roughly 25% over the prior January, down from the 41% growth generated in December. Investors might start questioning the overall size of the market now that Zillow should top 100 million MUUs during the summer period.At the same time that other online stocks are struggling with user growth metrics, Zillow as well has the ability to monetize users at higher rates whether or not user growth continues unabated. In the case of Zillow, real estate Q4 revenue grew a strong 73% to a record $70.8 million. A prime reason for the growth is that more agents spent more money on advertising. For the quarter, the real estate marketplace added 1,428 Premier Agent advertisers with the average revenue per advertiser hitting a record $359, up from $271 last year. The comp sales for agents on the site for more than 12 months were 59% higher, showing that agents see a growing benefit once they are advertising on the Zillow platform.Closing The MergerAs a reminder, the merger with Trulia was announced back in July when both stocks traded near all-time highs. Since that peak, both stocks saw substantial declines partially due to the typical seasonal weakness that previously saw Zillow hit annual lows during either November or December. The trend of the November low was only slightly breached in January due in part to concerns over FTC approval of the merger.The deal involves Trulia obtaining 0.444 shares of Zillow for a 33% ownership of the combined entity. With Zillow trading near $110, Trulia shareholders will obtain a value of roughly $48.84 per share, or roughly equivalent to the current trading price. With reports that the FTC would approve the merger back in January, any deal spread was wiped out with any remaining risk the merger wouldn't close eliminated.The companies forecast achieving at least $100 million in annual synergies by 2016 due mostly to cost avoidances. Zillow only reported $49.8 million in adjusted EBITDA for 2014, so $100 million provides a ton of leverage for the bottom line.TakeawayFor investors that took advantage of the seasonal trends and bought Zillow below $100, the stock is worth holding into the acquisition conference call tomorrow. For those still debating a position, my recommendation is to wait for more information on the combined entity. The lack of Trulia financials is concerning, especially considering the timing of the merger. A good selloff tomorrow though would provide a great opportunity to load up on the stock considering the normal seasonal trends that peak around August each year."
2390295,24996,2014-08-06T15:53:29-04:00,"Even if rich, the acquisition of Trulia by Zillow makes business sense.These dotcoms are less similar than they seem.Zillow-Trulia will not replace brokers, but is at the forefront of real estate technology.It has first-mover advantage in a highly-fragmented, technology-poor industry.The road is therefore clear for Zillow-Trulia to grow rapidly.","It was about time: tech is finally moving into the real estate industry. It had lagged other sectors, but it is now rapidly catching up, with the appearance and success of crowdfunding websites, online brokerage companies and data platforms. A real estate start-up accelerator has even been created in Chicago, REach.Real estate is now seeing the first wave of technology firms consolidation, most noticeably with last Monday's announcement of the acquisition of Trulia by competitor Zillow, for $3.5 billion in stock. The San Francisco and Seattle companies will remain independent brands, with Trulia's (TRLA) CEO reporting to his Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) counterpart. But they will create a giant capturing 71% of unique visitors to real estate websites. Zillow reported 83 million users for June 2014, and Trulia 54.The logic behind the deal is simple: while Zillow and Trulia focus on home buying, they are really media companies, not brokerage businesses. As such, they generate revenues through advertising, and are thus in need of high traffic. Cost-cutting, network effects and pricing power are the financial dynamics behind the merger.At first glance, the two sites appear to be twins. However, they have less in common than it seems. Zillow is favored by property buyers, Trulia by sellers. Two-thirds of Zillow's visitors do not use Trulia. Zillow's most popular feature is its ""Zestimate"" of how much a property is worth, while Trulia offers more analytical tools, such as detailed information on local criminal activity. And Trulia is faster-growing.Certainly, the merger is taking place at a high valuation: Trulia is being purchased at 65 times the current consensus estimates for 2015 EBITDA, and the company is currently unprofitable. If the tech markets or overall stock markets dip, then Zillow-Trulia's pricing might decline with them. Profits and new investments might be somewhat delayed. However these companies provide a real service, and therefore, will continue to develop. Independently of market movement, they will grow over the long run, and their valuations will follow. Zillow-Trulia should be seen as a long-term investment. And the companies' strong management should appease investors: Spencer Rascoff, Zillow's CEO, co-founded Hotwire.com, and has the vision, backing and experience to develop an online platform to its full potential.What are the consequences for real estate brokers and the way we shop for a house?Well, perhaps not so bad. Of course, large real estate brokerage concerns will have more muscle than smaller outfits when negotiating the cost of their Zillow-Trulia marketing.In certain industries, such as tourism, the internet has made redundant a large number of travel agents (think Expedia). Nevertheless, real estate is still a ""people business"" in which brokers are necessary. Buying or selling a house is an important and at times emotional decision which can require hand-holding. Computers have not put real estate agents out of business. Their number has actually grown from 140,000 in 2000 to 198,000 in 2013, according to estimates of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It has not become more popular to list a property for sale without an agent - the number of for-sale-by-owner properties as a percentage of property sales has declined from 13% in 2001 to 9% in 2013.An attractive aspect of Zillow-Trulia is that it does not have any very comparable competitor, either in business model or size. Zillow-Trulia is much larger in traffic and scope than Realtor.com and Homes.com, and it is different from firms such as ZipRealty.com (NASDAQ:ZIPR) or Urban Compass, which are brokerage firms employing agents. As demonstrated in the paragraph above, real estate brokerage has limits when being transferred online, and obtaining listings take more interpersonal skills than online advertising.All the more, Zillow-Trulia has kept competitive threats at bay by acquiring and integrating fast-growing, local firms such as StreetEasy in New York.Given its unique positioning in the market, a federal government antitrust challenge is a real risk. However, while it would impede the merger of Zillow and Trulia, it would have a limited impact on shareholders, and if anything, validate the dominant position of each firm.Most likely, Zillow-Trulia will keep co-existing with real estate brokers and evolve to become akin to a ""Wikipedia of homes"", or perhaps even a ""Facebook of real estate"" if it adds the social network component dear to venture capitalists. As such, it has enormous potential. As the home buying process continues the irreversible transition into the era of tablets, apps and smartphones, Zillow-Trulia has considerable room to grow, between constant technological innovations and a very fragmented, local real estate industry.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2480425,22148,2014-09-09T04:47:32-04:00,"Seasonal trends continue to dictate the price movements of real estate related traffic and stocks.Zillow's stock tends to peak in September and reach lows in December.Despite the recent drop due to a cooling of the Trulia merger excitement, investors should avoid the stock for now.","In spite of a strong history of year-over-year growth and a shift to online spending in the real estate sector, Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) has seen the stock drop consistently during the fall each year. Though investors shouldn't focus on timing the market, such identifiable trends shouldn't be ignored. In fact, investors can use this trend to improve long-term profits.Like most industries, the real estate market has a seasonal trend where transactions peak in the spring and summer selling. During this peak selling season, real estate agents are inclined to spend more on advertising to attract home buying clients.In the case of Zillow, Trulia (TRLA), and even Move (NASDAQ:MOVE), the user metrics tend to dip sequentially in the fourth quarter heading into the winter months. Should long-term investors ignore the stock trend due to the pending merger with Trulia or for any other reasons?Fall PeakWith the market forward looking, it isn't a huge surprise that Zillow's stock has peaked in September all three years it has been public. If the stock follows suit this year, it could have an impressive drop as investors became overly exited regarding the summer selling season and the potential merger with top competitor Trulia.Zillow had the following peak stock prices each year public:Outside the irrational jump for the week following the announcement of the Trulia deal that sent the stock to an all-time high of $164.90 in last July, the high for the stock was $148.54 on August 25 this year. The seasonal pattern appears mostly intact so far in 2014.The monthly user metrics back up this phenomenon with the stock. For the last three years the monthly unique users, or MUU, dropped sequentially during the fourth quarter. For 2013, the quarterly decline in MUUs was 11% while the user gains over the prior year were an impressive 57%. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the stock though plunged roughly 30% after peaking over $100 in September. This is a prime example of how a company is making great progress, but impatient investors dump the stock with a focus on the typical winter dip in users.Along with Zillow, Trulia and Move see traffic peak during the third quarter. Trulia continues to follow the trend of Zillow to a lesser extent while Move sees the similar traffic trends, but the stock continues to suffer from the shift away from realtor.com that it operates for realtors. Move hasn't seen the stock match the peak from the highs in the fall of 2013.Winter TroughThe ironic part is that just as the ink dries on the loses for the period of October and November, the stock regains momentum during December in anticipation of the spring selling seasons. In the case of Zillow, MUUs jumped during the first quarter of 2014 to reach nearly 71 million from the dip to only 54 million during the fourth quarter. More importantly, the first quarter users were a record by nearly 10 million MUUs over the prior third quarter.Zillow had the following trough stock prices each year public:The trough hasn't lasted for long due to the continuous year-over-year increase in premier agents even during the tough fourth quarter. While the amount of net subscriber addition declines during the reduced selling season, the total amount of subscribers continues to grow. For the fourth quarter, Zillow only added 3,565 subscribers, but the total subscriber base grew to 48,314. With a higher base of subscribers, revenue actually grew sequentially even with lower actual user traffic.Bottom LineIronically, Zillow's stock continues to follow a trend of peaking prior to a sequential user decline despite revenue growing sequentially. Investors interested in this stock should understand the trend follows the normal selling cycle in residential real estate and invest accordingly. The news on another bearish Citron Research report has already hit the stock some, but the data suggests that a bigger drop is in store considering the normalized high was around $148 and the stock still sits at $131. See the 3-year chart below:Investors should use the data to at the least avoid the stock for a few months until the dust settles on the typical annual selloff. At the most, investors can use the data depending on the impact of the Citron Research report to short the stock for now. Long term, the theme remains very bullish suggesting that investors should use any weakness to eventually use it as an opportunity to own the stock long term."
2364305,69535,2014-07-31T11:48:18-04:00,"There is significant downside risk in Zillow shares, which you now effectively hold.A Trulia sale likely signals business challenges.Cost reduction is a weak strategic rationale, and the stated target is not impressive.","On Monday morning, Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) announced it had entered a definitive agreement to acquire Trulia (TRLA), its closest competitor, for approximately $3.5 billion. The deal market is clearly booming, with North American M&A activity up 83% year-to-date. And technology companies are clearly in a mode of paying up for growth, as evidenced by recent high-multiple deals such as Priceline / OpenTable, Oracle / MICROS Systems, and Analog Devices / Hittite Microwave (not to mention Facebook's handful of billion-dollar private company deals). While I personally believe this deal has questionable strategic merit, there is one thing I can say with high confidence: current Trulia shareholders should thank the M&A gods for a nice premium and take the money and run.Be Afraid: You Now Hold a Zillow Tracking StockThere are many ways to structure the receipt of merger consideration, especially in stock-for-stock transactions. In this deal, the exchange ratio has been fixed at 0.444 Zillow shares per Trulia share. Based on prices as of last Friday's close, this ratio implied a price for Trulia shares of $70.53. In reality, Trulia shareholders are highly unlikely to receive that price at close. By negotiating a fixed exchange ratio, Trulia and their advisers have doomed the company's shareholders to absorbing all the downside risk associated with Zillow's shares. And that risk is substantial. If Zillow's stock simply returns to $126.47, its closing price on July 23, the day before the deal rumor surfaced, the implied price received for Trulia shares is $56.15. Subtract the current 7% merger spread, and that price is closer to $52, a long way from today's close of $62.If you owned Trulia shares, you probably thought the online real estate market was attractive but chose not to own Zillow, the clear market leader, because its valuation was crazy. Guess what; one of tech's most overvalued stocks just increased 19% over three trading days, and you now own it. At $149.87, Zillow trades at the second highest EV / NTM revenue multiple among technology companies with market capitalizations over $1 billion. And doing an admittedly simple pro forma for this transaction (excluding any revenue synergies, if any) does little to change that, as the table below illustrates. (data from CapitalIQ)Even the highly promotional Wall Street research community thinks Zillow's stock is dramatically overvalued, as the consensus median price target before the deal was $115.I won't re-hash many of the arguments about the questionable fundamentals of Zillow's business, emerging competitive threats, or the potential for this deal to backfire with respect to expectations for enhanced pricing leverage with real estate agents. You can find some of that discussion here (Citron).I will make a simpler point about post-deal announcement trading dynamics. Trulia's shareholder base is likely to see turnover as long-only investors capture the premium and sell to merger arbitrageurs. The arbs are currently looking at the 7% deal spread and salivating. Adjusting this number based on the anticipated time to close yields an annualized return of over 20%. In order to lock in this spread, arbitrageurs will buy Trulia and short Zillow. While those should offset, there will be more downward pressure on Zillow. The large number of shorts that got squeezed when both stocks rallied on the deal rumor are likely to re-build their positions, as this deal does nothing to allay their concerns or counteract the major points of the short thesis on Zillow.This net increase in short selling is likely to be accompanied by long-only investors exiting positions following Zillow's strong run. The stock is up 90% over the past six months, and it would be logical to take a wait-and-see approach as to whether Zillow can effectively integrate its largest acquisition ever and truly rationalize the combined company cost structure. Longs probably owned Zillow because they thought its clear market leadership would drive outsized gains as they crushed Trulia and other smaller players. Guess what; Zillow just decided to issue half its market cap in stock (and thereby dilute your ownership by 33%) to acquire one of those ""losers.""Sale Signals Trulia's Business Was Under PressureTrulia has consistently represented that it views the company as one of a handful of ""winners"" as the online real estate market consolidates. Much to Wall Street's dismay, the company had recently embarked on a strategy to aggressively ramp marketing expenses to ensure its place in the resultant oligopoly. Why then would the company decide to sell now? An obvious answer is that the early returns from this strategy were lacking. The chart below shows market share of organic search traffic between Zillow, Trulia and Realtor.com (owned by Move) as estimated by SEMrush. Trulia has consistently ceded share to Zillow, whose absurdly high marketing expenses seemed to at least draw more eyeballs.More striking, Trulia's organic search traffic has been in steep decline since Google's Panda 4.0 algorithm update in late May. While most of the market's focus has been on the impact of this event on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and RetailMeNot (NASDAQ:SALE) (see Searchmetrics article), data from Searchmetrics (below) suggests that Trulia's organic traffic was also hit hard. It is likely that investors have not been tracking the deterioration in Trulia organic search traffic, as the impact seems to have picked up steam in the weeks that followed the Panda update.While I have generally found Trulia's management team to be credible, insiders only own 7% of shares. In fact, Trulia's co-founder (and Director), Sami Inkinen, has been an aggressive seller of shares, as his holdings declined from over 2 million shares to about 600,000 over the past year and a half, and he has clearly checked out, as evidenced by his latest adventure of rowing from California to Hawaii (SFGate Article). Faced with declining organic traffic, an increasingly dominant competitor, and unsustainably high marketing expenses, it is not surprising that Trulia hit the bid.Expense Synergies Both Questionable as a ""Strategic"" Rationale and Likely Hard to AchieveOne of the top five rationale points for this deal is corporate cost savings, which is laughable. Both companies have been spending like drunken sailors. Over the past twelve months, Zillow's SG&A expense as a percent of revenue was 74.9%, and Trulia's was 75.6%. Even for Amazon.com, tech's poster child for runaway spending, this metric was only 17.8%. Clearly, neither company has operated with much financial discipline, so it is doubtful they will suddenly exercise some self-control.Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff believes this transaction advances his vision of creating a portfolio of real estate media properties. However, if the brands are to be run separately, both will require elevated marketing spend to continue to drive home buyers online and confront emerging competitive threats. While some investors may have been heartened to see $100 million of annualized cost savings in 2016 quoted in the transaction press release, a quick review of Street models would suggest nearly half of this comes from Trulia corporate G&A, and most of the rest could come from some technology development overlap. Simply cutting corporate overhead provides neither a compelling strategic rationale nor materially improves the combined company cost structure.ConclusionI do not question that the online real estate market will grow nicely or that the way consumers evaluate home purchases will undergo radical change over the coming decade. However, in the near term, I believe Trulia shareholders would be best served by exiting their position and permanently capturing the deal premium. Zillow's stock valuation and post-close integration and execution risks are simply too great. If nothing else, the Zillow / Trulia transaction should make investors fear that such a pricey (and potentially frivolous) deal marks a market top and that it could be a harbinger for the long-anticipated pullback in technology valuations. My advice is the same either way.Disclosure: The author is short TRLA. The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions. The author is not receiving compensation for it.

2371415,69625,2014-08-01T15:27:34-04:00,"Zillow is significantly overpriced, based on almost every valuation basis. Even if Zillow captures the entire underlying market the valuation makes no sense.There are risks associated with the underlying business which are not being properly discounted by the market.Zillow's moat is insignificant, and the market is full of competitive products which represent a threat to Zillow.Significant insider sales add credibility to the short thesis.","Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) is an online marketplace for real estate and home-related information. According to the latest 10-Q filing, Zillow has the following three major revenue streams:Selling Leads/Advertisements to Real Estate Brokers or the Premier Agent Program: This category represents the largest potential market for Zillow, and is the backbone of the bull thesis (more on that later). The Premier Agent Program accounted for around 68.5% of Zillow's revenue in Q1 2014 (Calculated as: average ARPU per month * 3 (number of months) * subscriber base).Selling Leads/Advertisements to Mortgage Companies (Zillow Mortgage Marketplace)/Mortech: Zillow charges lenders for essentially displaying their loan rate quotes on Zillow Marketplace. This stream accounted for around 10% of the total revenue.Display Ads Program: The display ads program serves text/picture and animated ads on Zillow website and apps. The growth of this stream has not been as impressive as the other two categories, and now represents only 19% of revenue compared to 39% in 2011 Q1. (It still grew at a blistering pace of >50% growth YoY in last three quarters.)To evaluate Zillow's stock price, we will analyze the total addressable market/maximum possible revenue for each of these streams. We will then join the market mania and assume that by the power of wishful thinking, Zillow and Trulia (TRLA) immediately capture the total addressable market/revenue calculated. We will then analyze Zillow/Trulia as a stable company and try to estimate a fair price.Total Addressable Market/Potential Revenue for ZillowPremier Agent Program: The total real estate transactions for existing and new homes were around 1.4 trillion in 2013. Assuming an average 5% real estate agent commission on each transaction, the total commissions paid to agents last year were $70 billion. We also assume that on an average, each agent spends 10% of this money on marketing. The total marketing budget for all real estate agents is ~$7 billion. It's worth noticing that Zillow's 2013 revenue is a meager 2.8% of this massive marketing spend. Let's assume that in the best-case scenario, there is no competition, Zillow/Trulia dominate the market, and by magic of wishful thinking, real estate agents start spending around 40% of their marketing budget on Zillow/Trulia. That's a total of around $2.8 billion in revenue. It's interesting to note that total revenue of Trulia+Zillow for 2013 was around $340 million. In the perpetual scenario, the rate of growth for this business stream would be equal to the real estate growth rate (roughly 3%-4% per year).Zillow Mortgage Marketplace: To address the addressable market of this revenue stream, we will find the average revenue generated per loan request in Q1 2014. We will then estimate the total number of loan requests in the best-case scenario and apply the same multiple on each sale.From Zillow's last 10-Q total loan requests: 5.818 millionTotal Marketplace revenue: ~$7 millionTotal revenue per loan request on Zillow mortgage: ~$1.22 (7/5.818)Total houses sold in U.S. in 2013 = 5.073 millionFrom zillow's 2013 10-K , ratio of loan request to number of houses sold =~ 4.Assume at peak for each house sold in US there are 10 loan requests on zillow.Total addressable revenue/market based on current rates = 10*5.073*1.22 = 61.9 millionDisplay Ads: Zillow had a total of approx 200,000 unique visitors on its website in 2013. This implies that for every home sale in America, approximately 200,000/5000 = 40 unique visitors visited Zillow's website. Assume by terminal year 100 unique visitors visit Zillow's website. We also assume that the display ad rate remains unchanged. (Display ads is a highly competitive industry, and hence, chances of significantly better rates are slim).Total display revenue in terminal year = 2.5*43 million = ~$107 million.For all the three revenue sources, we can assume that the perpetual growth rate will be more or less in line with the inflation rate. We will assume that the long-term inflation rate is around 3%-4%.Total revenue from all three streams = 2.8 billion (Premier Agent Program) + 61.9 million (Zillow Mortgage Marketplace) + 107 million (Display Ads) = ~ 2.96 billionAssuming a P/S ratio of 3.86 (same as KO), market cap = 3.86 * 2.96 billion = ~ $11.4 billionAssuming a profit margin of 20% (same as GOOG) and P/E of 15 (for a company growing at the rate of inflation) market cap = 0.2 * 2.96* 15 = $8.88 billionAt the time of writing, the combined market cap of Trulia and Zillow hovers just shy of $9 billion. This shows that it's almost impossible to even dream of a scenario where the current valuation of Zillow makes sense.Risks to Zillow Bull ThesisNow that we have determined that Zillow is not cheap even in the best possible scenario, let's come back to our senses and look at some other risks to Zillow's business, besides the sky-high valuation (as explained above):Low Operating Leverage: Zillow employs a huge sales and marketing team, and there is good reason for it. Zillow sells the premier agent program to real estate agents by good old cold calling. Hence, the cost of sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue has been consistently high over the years. Here, we plot S&M cost as a percentage of revenue.Source: Author; Data source: historical Zillow filingsA closer look at recent years shows that Zillow has to consistently spend more money on S&M to increase revenue. This paints a picture of a low-margin business which relies on telesales for its revenue. This is considerably different from a Web 2.0 business like LinkedIn (LNKD)/OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN), which Zillow frequently compares itself to.Competition: Below, I present a comparative analysis of Zillow with Redfin (OTC:RFNN).As you can see, the competitive advantage of Zillow, if any, is really thin. In fact, a quick Google search for ""Redfin vs. Zillow"" brings up numerous blogs/articles like this or this, where users rated Redfin either higher or equal to Zillow.Another plausible risk going forward comes from websites like Yelp/Google reviews. Remember, the primary business of Zillow is selling leads to real estate agents. Consumers give more weight to recommendations from people they know or large crowdsourced recommendations. It's possible that in an increasingly social online experience, real estate agents will realize that the value add of paid leads (provided by Zillow) is lower compared to online reviews from trusted websites. Such a scenario will seriously reduce Zillow's pricing power.Insider Sales: Insider selling by itself doesn't tell much, but heavy insider selling is never a good sign. According to Yahoo Finance, insiders have sold a solid 1.41 million shares in the last 6 months.ConclusionI would recommend a short position in Zillow. Since there is a considerable risk of a short squeeze, I recommend a synthetic short position via long dated options (for example, a bear call spread).Disclosure: The author is short Z.

2553985,61601,2014-10-10T14:38:01-04:00,"Excessive insider selling at Zillow raises red flag.
        Increasingly difficult to support P/S and P/E levels in post QE market.
        Revenue growing 70% annually, but total expense is rising close to 80%.","As a resident of Seattle I have met several people who currently work or have worked for Zillow. After the Trulia deal was announced I became curious about the stock's performance and fundamentals. Considering it's a relatively young company, IPO June 2011, that's focused on internet services and a recovering sector it's no surprise it's up 35% year to date, and more than 300% in the past three. However, upon further review there are several factors that raised some red flags and provided impetus for this brief article. This is not a balanced assessment of the company, but serves to inform on potential areas of interest that existing shareholders and new investors may want to consider.This year insiders have sold more than 840,000 shares valued in excess of $86 million. Considerable selling is not all that surprising for a company that relies heavily on stock options for executive compensation, but what is surprising is the level of insider ownership. Combined, the CEO, CFO, CTO, and Chief Marketing officer hold 38,198 shares. Without wading into the company's financial statements I don't know how many options that may vest in the near future, but this amount of outright ownership seems particularly low. I went through a slew of companies that have recently started trading in a variety of sectors, but could not find another with the amount and consistency of simultaneous option exercises and stock sales. If top management can't stand holding a substantial amount of shares for more than a few days it does not inspire holding for longer periods of time.Despite being founded almost 10 years ago and achieving significant market share the company has yet to achieve profitability. Four of the past five quarters have resulted in negative EPS. The company is barely cash flow positive on quarterly revenues of $50 - $80 million. With a forward PE of over 115 and price to sales of 18 it will be difficult for the stock to appreciate based purely on multiple expansion. If revenue growth in the upcoming quarter does not meet lofty expectations it will add significant pressure to a company that analysts have already set a high bar for.While annual revenue growth of approximately 70% for the past three years is very impressive, it is underpinned by costs that have increased 80% annually during that same time. This growth has largely been driven by the recovering housing market and shifts in real estate advertising expenditures. Zillow has benefited from the amount of data and transparency that is now available to potential home buyers. However, despite gaining significant market share it has lost more money in three consecutive quarters. The company has lost $15 million on sales of $257 million in the past four quarters on weakening margins. It's trading over 115 times next year earnings with a PEG ratio exceeding 6. Investors who have profits in the shares should consider taking them and new investors should proceed with caution or wait for a better entry price."

        Lost in the enthusiasm are the significant risks that this acquisition brings.
        With the added share dilution from this acquisition, it will take extraordinary profit growth for Zillow to justify its valuation.","Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) agreed on Monday to acquire fellow real estate listing site Trulia (TRLA) for $3.5 billion in an all stock deal. TRLA shareholders will receive 0.444 shares of Z for each share they hold, which should increase Z's outstanding shares by about 41%.The market has reacted enthusiastically to this deal. Z is up roughly 20% since the news of the potential acquisition first broke. TRLA is up 55%, and has a further 10% to go to meet the stated acquisition price.Most analysts have hailed the deal as one that will give the combined company massive pricing power and make it the dominant player in online real estate listing. However, analysts have overstated the positives and significantly understated the risks from this acquisition.Burning CashBoth Z and TRLA have had consistently negative free cash flow, which they finance by further diluting their shareholders. Between 2011 and 2013, Z increased its total shares outstanding by ~38%. TRLA increased its shares by 34%. Both companies are aggressively diluting shareholders to fund their operating losses.Z's acquisition of TRLA is an acceleration of this trend. This acquisition will dilute the stock by a further 40%, and the combined company should, at least at first, burn even more cash. Both companies are already operating at a loss, and acquisition costs in the first year will use up additional cash. Z appears far from done with losing money and diluting investors.Why Investors Are ExcitedA combined Z and TRLA would have a dominant market share in the online real estate market, up to 71% according to some sources. Already some are predicting that Zillow could become ""the Facebook of homes"", a place where every home's information has to be if it wants to sell.Investors are also predicting an earlier path to profitability if the companies combine. Management has projected $100 million in cost savings once the acquisition is complete, and increased pricing power is also expected.Why This Deal is A Hail MaryEven if this deal works out as analysts hoped, the profit growth expectations implied by Z's valuation are already tremendous. In order to justify its valuation of $150/share Z must earn pre-tax margins of 20%, equivalent to what it earned in 2011, its most profitable year, and grow revenue by 44% compounded annually for 10 years.Like many fast-growing internet companies, Z has forgone profits recently in order to achieve revenue growth. In 2013, it spent almost $160 million on the discretionary items ""Sales and Marketing"" and ""Technology and Development"". These two items comprised 80% of revenue.Compare this to 2011, when Z spent only 60% of revenue on those two items and managed to earn a 20% pre-tax margin. Essentially, Z's valuation implies that it will be able to absorb TRLA, scale back spending on marketing and development by 25%, and still grow revenues at a rapid clip.Additionally, there's good reason to believe that Z won't be nearly as powerful or profitable after the acquisition as analysts are projecting. The companies have acknowledged that combined they still only account for 4% of U.S. real estate marketing spending, and Citron Research has raised some interesting questions as to whether the combined company would actually gain pricing power.It's entirely possible that Z could complete this acquisition, become a dominant force in real estate, and make shareholders lots of money. Just like it's possible for a quarterback to run around for 15 seconds, launch a 70-yard bomb into the end zone, and win the game. Sometimes it happens. More often, though, something goes wrong. The odds are against Z shareholders on this one.Sam McBride contributed to this report.Disclosure: David Trainer and Sam McBride receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, sector, or theme.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

So far this earnings season we've seen incredibly strength in mobile advertising from the likes of Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Yelp, and Twitter.

The size of this market that Zillow could still grow into is what has investors watering at the mouth.Combining resources may also reduce the need for hiring and save the company big bucks on its own marketing campaigns.

        Zillow's valuation surge takes it to the number 1 spot among select internet companies (before Twitter's earnings of course).
        As a result, the market appears to be mispricing execution risk.","Last month, I claimed that the Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN) deal to acquire OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) helped to calibrate valuations for internet stocks. The Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) deal to acquire Trulia (TRLA) upped the ante on valuations in a big way.The rumor and then the actual announcement was a rare episode where both the acquirer and the acquisition target increased in price and valuation. The rumor went public Thursday, July 24th. Zillow's stock was neatly resting against its 50-day moving average (DMA) - coincidentally, so was Trulia's stock - with a $5.0B market cap. By the Friday's close, the last trading day before the deal went official, Zillow was a $6.3B company. Trulia fared even better of course. It went from a $1.5B company to a $2.1B company. When the market closed after the deal was officially announced on July 28th, the combined company had soared to a value of $8.7B from the $6.5B they were worth right before the rumors. In other words, simply by combining forces, the market ""decided"" that these companies would generate another $2.2B in value. Those are pretty lofty expectations for companies that earned a combined revenue of $399M in the last 12 months: around a 5.5X multiplier just for merging. (Valuation and market cap data are from Yahoo! Finance)The trend in the 50-day moving average has been Zillow's friend…and magnet this year.Trulia's breakout in May is validated by the Zillow deal…The deal pushed Zillow to the number one spot on my valuation of internet-related companies (of course, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is likely to retake #1 after the market opens post-earnings). Trulia jumped to #4, pushing ahead of OpenTable and creating a new bar for valuations.The conference call explaining the deal was not quite as interesting as PCLN's for the OPEN deal. The most interesting moment came when an analyst from JMP Securities asked roughly the following:Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff smartly answered ""Why not now?"" He went on to make the point that Zillow's board unanimously agreed that it would rather own 2/3 of the combined company than 100% of Zillow. Indeed, when the market closed at the end of the day, 2/3 of the combined company was worth 17% more than Zillow alone was worth before the rumors began. So on pure math, this deal is a no-brainer, particularly from Zillow's perspective and even more if the two companies can indeed reach the projected $100M in ""cost avoidances"" by 2016. Rascoff summed up the valuation story this way:The market went crazy anyway but in a direction beneficial to both companies.I was fortunate enough to be long Trulia before the rumors broke but not quick enough to take off a limit order to sell at $47 when I noticed the reaction in the stock to the rumors. I had on a purely technical trade playing support at the 50DMA. Now, I am positioned the other way with a put spread on Zillow. As the market soared in response to the acquisition news, it just seemed to me that Zillow should be trading back where it was before the rumors of a deal. The deal will not close for many months out and the core benefit is projected out two years. There has to be a lot of execution risk baked into this deal going forward, risk that is being grossly mispriced. I could of course be wrong, but I think the risk/reward is very attractive here.The next hurdles are earnings reports for both companies in the coming week. It is hard to imagine that their combined earnings news will trump the grand excitement of the deal, creating additional downward bias on their stocks. Finally, August and September tend to be the weakest months of the year for the stock market…Be careful out there!Disclosure: The author is short Z.

2352215,25120,2014-07-29T10:15:37-04:00,"Zillow is set to acquire Trulia in a $3.5 billion all-stock deal.The deal creates an absolute leader in online residential real estate solutions and will save an anticipated $100 million in costs per annum.Yet a +$10 billion valuation seems a bit stretched after runaway momentum, leaving a non-compelling risk-reward scenario at the moment.","Merger Monday kicks off with a big deal which is the acquisition of Trulia (TRLA) by Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) in a big $3.5 billion all-stock transaction.The deal creates a market leader in online real-estate offerings. While I like the long-term prospects of the combination, I have serious doubts about the +$10 billion valuation at the moment given the combined revenue base of just $400 million.While the tie-up could very well create a leading player in its field over the coming years, I don't think that the current risk-reward is very appealing.Highlights Of The DealZillow announced that the highly anticipated deal to acquire Trulia has been agreed upon. This came after reports about a potential deal broke out on Thursday afternoon.Under terms of the definitive agreement, Zillow will acquire Trulia in an all-stock transaction, valuing the business at $3.5 billion.The deal, which has been approved by the board of directors of both companies, is expected to close in 2015.Operational Implications And Strategic RationaleAfter the acquisition, Zillow will maintain its own brand as well as Trulia, both being separate consumer brands which offer information to buyers, sellers, homeowners and renters.The companies will continue to offer advertising and software solutions to real estate professionals, as the combined increase in market power might give the combination more pricing pressure.The companies stress that while both companies have grown quickly in recent times, real estate is still very much underrepresented online. Zillow states that the pro-forma revenues of the combination are less than 4% of the annual $12 billion which real estate professionals spend on their annual marketing efforts.Yet both companies have a huge reach, with Zillow having 83 million unique users on mobile and web in June, while Trulia's online properties were visited by some 54 million unique visitors that month.The combination aims to boost the pace of innovation, and provide greater access to free real estimate market data. Of course, industry professionals can further benefit from broader distribution and a greater value of the online offerings. This can boost the effectiveness of the advertising solutions on the websites by real estate professionals.Zillow's CEO Rascoff stresses that both companies will continue to operate with stand-alone front end operations. Zillow will mainly focus on general market data as well as transaction-related information, while Trulia will focus more on buyers, renters and sellers. The distinctive focus is also evident in the differentiated customer base, with half of Trulia's website visitors not visiting the website of Zillow and about two-thirds of the visitors of Zillow not visiting Trulia's website.While the companies will continue to operate as stand-alone businesses, the back-end operations will of course be combined resulting in an estimated $100 million in cost savings by 2016.The Financial TermsUnder terms of the deal, investors in Trulia stand to receive 0.444 shares in Zillow for every share they currently own. Based on Zillow's closing price of $158.86 per share on Friday, the deal values Trulia at $70.53 per share.There appears to be some skepticism regarding the potential closing of the deal. Shares of Zillow initially fell to $150 following the news, but even when trading at $162.50 during the afternoon, shares of Trulia trade just shy of $67. This is still quite a bit below the implicit offer price of $72 per share based on the agreed terms.In total, Trulia's shareholders will hold about a 33% stake in the new business. The deal is of course subject to anti-trust provisions, a reason why shares might still trade at a discount compared to the offer price. Zillow's co-founders, as well as Trulia's shareholders, who hold over 7% of the outstanding share base, have agreed in favor of the deal.Pro Forma ImplicationsZillow has posted trailing sales of $224.8 million for the past twelve months, posting annual sales growth of 70% over the past quarter. The company did post some $15 million in losses over this time period which was not really a big issue given that it held a net cash position of little over $300 million.Trulia has posted sales of $174.2 million over the past twelve months and its sales growth of 127% has been even more impressive, although it was aided by acquisitions. Its net loss of nearly $31 million was a bit steep as well. Trulia did hold about $220 million in cash and equivalents ahead of the deal, while operating with a roughly flat net cash position.Combined both firms report sales of about $400 million, while they are losing close to $50 million per annum currently.Given the $3.5 billion reported deal tag, Zillow anticipates about 49.6 million shares outstanding by Trulia. This means that Trulia's shareholders combined will own about 22 million shares in Zillow.This means that the total outstanding share base in Zillow would be about 66 million shares at the moment. With shares trading at $162.50 per share, the new combination is valued at $10.7 billion, or about 26-27 times trailing annual revenues!The Deal Makes Sense, But What About The Price Tag?The tie-up between Trulia and Zillow makes perfect sense, as both companies were in some sort of a marketing war in recent times, boosting their marketing costs in order to gain professional customers in the real estate industry.As such the consolidation does not only allow for lower marketing costs, but also allows for the sharing of costs at the back end. The $100 million cost savings, anticipated for 2016 are huge. In comparison, Trulia has posted sales of only $175 million on a trailing basis. The anticipated cost savings of a deal are enough to allow the combination to report a profit, but by far not enough to justify a +$10 billion valuation.While the combination only generates pro-forma revenues of about $400 million at the moment, the current run-rate based upon the latest quarter is approaching $500 million per annum. Given the huge growth trajectory, a billion in trailing sales at some point next year cannot be ruled out. As such investors are very upbeat, believing that both companies are still in the start-up phase of the online real estate market. Today's tie-up increases the chance for domination of this market going forward.This is the sole reason why the valuation of over $10 billion could make any sense. Note that at the moment, hopes and risks have increased after shares of both companies have nearly doubled so far this year.While I have been a previous shareholder in Trulia, the current momentum is too much for me to provide any appealing risk-reward opportunity at the moment. As such I remain on the sidelines, keeping a close eye on the developments. I won't jump the bandwagon for now.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2351775,20335,2014-07-29T09:06:58-04:00,,"Editors' note: This article first appeared on Citron Research's own website.The stock market and the real estate industry are all abuzz about the possible merger of Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and Trulia (TRLA). The media is now filled with stories proclaiming that the combined company will instantly become an internet advertising juggernaut that wields pricing power over the entire internet real estate industry. You cannot read a single article or analyst commentary that doesn’t invoke the magic phrase “Pricing Power”. Without the slightest thought whatsoever, the combination of Zillow and Trulia is supposed to give the combined entity the power to triple ad revenue from real estate agents. Nothing could be further from the truth – and we have the proof.Citron Research now exposes the big lie that has never been discussed by any sell side analyst, mainstream media pundit, and most importantly NEVER DISCLOSED by Zillow or Trulia. Zillow/Trulia already have in place a rock bottom deal with Realogy, the largest real estate agency in the world, that prohibits ALL OTHER agencies from advertising on their listings … and for this they pay a fee 95% lessthan any other agency pays. Not only is this deal unsustainable in the industry, we’re not at all sure if it’s even legal from an anti-trust perspective. But incredibly, it falls to Citron to publish the documents that no one from either Zillow or Trulia has ever showed Wall Street. This deal spans all of the Realogy agencies:We’ve published a copy directly from Coldwell Banker. Below is the pricing for the 175,000 Realogy agents who are a dominant force in the industry. Not only amazing -- IT HAS NEVER BEEN DISCLOSED. And it already covers exclusive agent status on both Zillow and Trulia – most notably with regard to excluding other brokers’ ads from Realogy listings.Indicted by their own words:Really? Anybody ever read Chapter 1 about anti-competitive practices and antitrust laws? PRICING POWER: Never Had it … Never WillFrom these numbers we can easily conclude that Realogy knew what they were doing when they cut the deal, and if in years to come Z/T wanted to raise prices- the nuclear option is always Realogy’s to commit.But It Gets Even Worse For Zillow / TruliaDespite Realogy already having a deal to block all competing agent ads on its listings for an undisclosed small sum, they are still moving aggressively to compete directly -- going head-to-head against Z/T, which should make Z/T concerned about the nuclear option despite the rock bottom pricing. Realogy is already preparing for a black-swan price increase, by building a robust real estate portal of their own, that also accepts competitors’ listings. Meanwhile, whatever metrics you use, if Realogy pulls its listings off of Zillow / Trulia, it would hardly dent their business at all. However, that step would evaporate the $9 billion Zillow / Trulia entity.(Source.)IF Zillow’s easy answer is “Once their agents are on the ecosystem we can upsell them the other software products"" … sorry. Just last week Realogy bought Zip Realty, mainly for their lead technology platform. This action is perfectly aligned with Realogy’s stated intention above, not Zillow’s faint promise of massive future upselling.Since When Does Working for Warren Buffett put you at a Competitive Disadvantage? Wake up, Wall Street! Ask the Question!How long until Keller Williams, Remax, or Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) demand similar terms from Z/T? The nuclear option is equally available to them as well if they do not get preferred pricing. If they pull their listings off of Z/T, Z/T collapses as they lose 30% of the listings in the US. In brief, the Zillow Trulia merger does nothing to build a sustainable competitive landscape. Does any of the above lead us to believe that prices for online real estate advertising are going up … or going down?Wall Street NegligenceIs it that they don’t know…they don’t understand…or they don’t care?As recently as Friday, in a conference call held by CRT, the hosting analyst was asked if the combined company had any deals in place that would limit pricing power with any agencies. His response was “None that I know of ...” besides maybe Douglas Elliman (NYC only). So amazingly, this price and precedent between the largest real estate agency company and the largest internet advertisers of real estate listings has gone undisclosed -- and unmodeled in analyst projections.The Writing is On the Wall The only three countries in which online listing portals have been able to generate significant profits – in each case due to lack of a viable MLS system – are Australia ,the UK, and China. All three have all faced backlash from local real estate agents about gradual price hikes, with brokers exerting pricing power and/or taking decisive steps to set up alternatives. How will US real estate agents react to the threat of drastic prices hikes from Z/T, when they already have alternative systems (MLS, and broker websites) in place?Citron could publish volumes regarding internet traffic overlap, regional MLS strategies to adjust to / compete with Trulia/Zillow, customer backlash, and every other red flag raised about this company.But none of it matters if you have an undisclosed business practice, one that you have been hiding from Wall Street, that just torpedoes your own business plan.Conclusion After $170 million of cumulative losses and years of missing estimates, lowering guidance, and downward revisions to their business models, two companies have apparently decided to combine their two money losing business models and sell it to Wall Street. If you are on the fence, close your computer, pick up your phone and call a real estate agent and ask what they think about the Realogy deal – nothing else needs to be said.Disclaimer: Citron does not guarantee in any way that it is providing all of the information that may be available.

In addition to their living database of homes, accessible on Zillow.com, they also own and operate Zillow Mobile, their suite of home-related mobile applications; Zillow Mortgage Marketplace, where borrowers connect with lenders to find loans and get competitive mortgage rates; Zillow Digs, a home improvement marketplace where consumers can find visual inspiration and local cost estimates; Zillow Rentals, a marketplace and suite of tools for rental professionals; Postlets; Diverse Solutions; Agentfolio; Mortech; HotPads and StreetEasy.Thesis: Zillow, despite being a high growth company operating in an enormous market, already has its stock pricing in massive revenue growth and margin expansion trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of approximately 160. Any slowdown and/or delay in revenue or their profitability timeline could send the stock free falling. Even if Zillow meets analysts' lofty expectations, the stock is not projected to appreciate much from current levels. The stock's recent run appears to be the result of a short squeeze as a result of the stock's high short interest (22%).Time Frame: 18 MonthsPrice Target: $100 (Derived From Comparable Company Analysis)Strategy: GARPConsensus Opinion: Analysts are bearish on the stock with a mean price target of 106. Analysts are projecting earnings per share of $.29 for 2014 and $.85 for 2015. Analysts are projecting strong revenue growth and margin expansion, but the majority feel the current price captures the growth already.Catalysts:· Earnings Misses· General Market/Technology Sell-Off (Zillow in its bubble state likely to fall much more quickly and further)· Decline in real estate market· Increased competition via existing companies or venture-backed competitors· Real estate, mortgage and rental professionals or other advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending on ZillowWhy Zillow's Growth Is Overpriced: I produced an analysis of Zillow versus comparable high growth internet equities and demonstrated that Zillow was overvalued due to its similar revenue growth and similar large addressable market, but much higher valuation. I waited to short Zillow when it was $100 per share because I was aware a further run up could occur in the shares prior to a major decline. Although it is impossible to know when a drop will occur, the stock is now obviously a much more compelling short than it was before, and in our view has limited upside (short's downside) at the current price.Revenue growth is also largely being driven by increased sales and marketing, which in Q1 2014 exceeded revenue growth. Essentially, Zillow is buying its users with viral growth, obviously not as large as the company would like.Partnership Agreements With Real Estate Firms Are A Business Model Error: Citron recently published a great analysis of these agreements, which for the sake of brevity I am not reproducing.Insider Selling: There has been tremendous insider selling of Zillow at these prices, the most recent being the Chief Revenue Officer selling his options at $136 per share. Additionally, the CEO Spencer Rascoff has been selling shares of his options at these record prices. If management is so confident in the valuation of the company, with the market size validating the current stock price, why is management selling their shares by the lots?Valuation:Discounted Cash Flow:Valuing the company with reasonable assumptions shows the extreme downside that can occur. A discounted cash flow values the company at approximately $50 per share, which is where analysts originally were placing the intrinsic value in 2011.Comparable Company Analysis:Zillow trades at a large premium to its other high multiple, fast growing competitors. Using the mean P/E of the comp. set (84) on 2015 projected earnings yields a price of $100 per shareBull Case: The highest analyst price target is currently $150, 6% above current levels. This price target assumes ARPU growth, margin expansion and expansion of Zillow's rental offerings. This valuation in our view prices in perfect execution, and any decline in these metrics or new product expansions could cause the stock to freefall.Key Risk Factors: The largest risk factor is that the short squeeze takes the stock to $170, completely ignoring any conventional valuation. This is a legitimate risk, but in the long-term an investor should achieve strong returns because there seems to be a very low probability Zillow can justify a $5.6 billion market capitalization once fundamentals come into play. Even if Zillow achieves 30% EBITDA margins like the CEO discusses and continues strong 20%+ revenue growth over the coming years, that would only justify the current price providing minimal upside.Disclosure: The author is short Z.

We also see a low EQ score (the degree to which current earnings are backed by strong free cash flow, conservative accruals/exclusions).One interesting point highlighted by the StarMine EQ model is that exclusions (i.e. pro forma earnings, rather than GAAP earnings) allowed the company to make its earnings target. On a U.S. GAAP basis, the company would have actually missed. While there's significant discretion awarded to companies in how they treat various accounting items, you can see that there's a persistent pattern of using other exclusions.Caution flagsWhile price and analyst revisions momentum remains strong, one early warning sign comes from analyst recommendations. Earnings per share have surged dramatically in recent months, along with the rest of the income statement. However, analysts seem to be sounding a more cautious note - with a number of downgrades (to hold). Essentially, the message seems to be that the analysts love the stock (everyone loves fast growing stocks) but can't get themselves enthusiastic about the current stock price.Remember Cisco?To my original point - everyone loved Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in 1999. The thesis on which the stock was adored was that the world was changing - switches, routers, etc. were going to be the backbone of this new world - and who wouldn't want to buy the firm that was providing the key infrastructure? This was the modern day version of being the guy selling spades and shovels to the gold miners. It was the sure thing while the miners hoped to strike it rich.Where's the beef?As it happens, the CSCO bulls were entirely right on their thesis. The company did grow, did provide the backbone for today's Internet and, to boot, was, and is, well managed. Unfortunately, expectations for how that growth would translate into astronomical earnings were a little wider of the mark - the CSCO share price of 2001 remains its high water mark, despite 2013 revenue of $48.6 billion compared to $18.9 billion in 2000. Putting it another way - the market was paying $75 for $18.9 billion of revenue; today it's paying $25 for $48.6 billion.Returning to Zillow - the company is growing revenue (EPS, not so much) at a fast pace. Management seems astute and has a great track record with Internet retail. None of that is in dispute. The question is simply whether a shareholder today, owning equity at $134 - is adequately rewarded for risk in an uncertain world. That valuation implies five-year EPS growth, compounding, of 86.7%., i.e. 86% growth every year. The forward P/E (I know earnings are out of fashion and all, but I still want to point it out) is 226 times.Alan Greenspan called his irrational exuberance about three years too early - and wise economists always give a prediction, or a date, never both. However I think that it is clear that a number of stocks are returning to valuation zones that effectively ignore the risk of external shocks, and certainly ignore the likelihood of strong competition emerging.In such an environment - whether retail investor or professional portfolio manager - it pays to think about the risks in the event of a misstep (look at recent performance for online UK retailer ASOS, which we covered earlier in the year). If the markets turn nervous and do some type of March 2000 replay (or 2008) - well, in such an environment you want companies with solid earnings, great cash flow and conservative accounting and exclusions policies. I think it's clear Zillow would struggle to meet that description.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Alpha Now at Thomson Reuters is a team of expert analysts that are constantly looking at the financial landscape in order to keep you up to date on the latest movements.

2254303,66403,2014-06-05T07:48:22-04:00,"Zillow's stock has bucked trend of weak housing data for now, possibly due to a short squeeze.Comparable companies trade at discounts by a variety of metrics.Management has difficulty controlling costs; equity compensation is aggressive.Insiders have been heavy sellers of the Company's stock.","Zillow, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) operates real estate and home-related information marketplaces through a variety of mobile applications and its desktop website Zillow.com. Management markets the firm as a one-stop-shop for buying, selling, renting, borrowing, and remodeling. The firm is a leader in the real estate marketplace space and dwarfs in competitors Trulia, Inc. (TRLA) and Move, Inc. (NASDAQ:MOVE). MOVE runs the website realtor.com.The main source of Zillow's revenue and revenue growth is its Zillow Marketplace segment. The firm makes money in three distinct ways in this segment:Real estate agent subscriptions are the main revenue driver in Zillow's business and consistency could come under pressure during a prolonged downturn in the housing recovery. Long periods with low growth in housing prices could incentivize RE agents to focus on other sources of income besides the market and in turn drop their subscriptions. Zillow does not report a churn rate for its real estate agent subscriptions; it must be weak, otherwise the firm would report the metric.Recent Housing WeaknessFrom September 2013 through March 2014, the Case-Shiller 20-city index has hardly budged. Trulia and Move have been hurt by weaker housing data alongside a sell-off in momentum stocks, both stocks are down 25% from their 52-week highs. Zillow, on the other hand, has been resilient and made new 52-week highs early last week. Housing weakness has failed to put a dent in Zillow's revenue growth rate, but there is no guarantee that real estate agents will continue to ignore the slowing rate of growth in housing price increases.Comparable Companies' AnalysisNeither Z, TRLA, nor MOVE turned a profit over the last twelve months. TRLA and MOVE trade at significant discounts to Z based on Price/Sales (P/S) and Price/Tangible Book Value (P/TBV), as we can see from this chart:Source: 10-Q Filings, Yahoo FinanceMOVE sticks out from the other two for its lack of revenue growth but more attractive prospects for the near future, so it is probably the least risky of the three prospects. Because MOVE isn't growing, it is harder to compare to Z and TRLA.TRLA trades at better multiples of P/S, P/TBV, and Q/Q revenue growth but has more rapidly rising expenses than Z. TRLA's expenses rose 166%, greater than revenue growth, while Z's expense growth was in line with revenue growth at 70.0%.I think that the first three metrics overshadow TRLA's expense growth and make it the strongest candidate from a comparable companies' standpoint. TRLA has more sales that are growing at a faster rate than Z and has more tangible assets as a percentage of the firm's value.Cost ControlZillow was able to constrain its expense growth to its revenue growth rate, which is a positive, but dollar compensation expenses were artificially restricted by large issuances of employee stock options. The Company's share count rose approximately 16% from the March quarter last year. Zillow cannot continue to issue this much equity in the future and will have to resort to dollar compensation at some point, adding to compensation expenses.Zillow has also rapidly increased its Sales and Marketing spend, up 76.3% from the March quarter last year, outrunning revenue growth. This level of Sales and Marketing expense growth is not encouraging. Aggressive advertising aimed at real estate agent subscriptions could be a symptom of a high churn rate and is unsustainable in the long run. Cost control appears to be a big problem at Zillow due to rapid equity issuance and high advertising costs.Insider SellingThe large majority of Zillow insiders own vested options, meaning they cannot exercise them until a predetermined time. According to the Company's 10-Q filing, they are ""typically granted with seven-year terms and typically vest 25% after 12 months and ratably thereafter over the next 36 months.""Over the last six months, there have been forty-eight insider sales and zero insider buys. It follows that management believes that the shares are overvalued and will continue to exercise options and sell shares as their options vest.ConclusionZillow, Inc. is an overvalued stock. Recent housing weakness, better priced comparable companies, weak cost control, and insider selling all point to a company with many more reasons to fall than continue to increase.If the current short squeeze runs out of gas, Zillow is an excellent short candidate. Shorting overextensions using small position sizing is an attractive option at the moment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2263533,24580,2014-06-11T11:34:56-04:00,"Zillow has had great success with its advertising campaigns.80 million unique users logged onto Zillow.com during April, a net gain of 26.5 million Y/Y.Premier Agent Subscribers have grown to over 50,000.","Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) has been around for eight years, leading the online real estate and home related service industry. An interesting fact is that Zillow has only been spending money on advertising since 2013. Prior to that, the company relied on organic growth from social media websites and word of mouth. But since the company started investing in advertising, it has seen tremendous success. Zillow spent $40 million on advertising in 2013 and measured great metrics. A show of confidence is in the fact that it has already spent $65 million in the six months of 2014.Zillow quantifies the advertisement success by measuring the traffic to its site. From those raw numbers the company differentiates unique users and unique shoppers. The company has seen positive traffic through increased contact by shoppers to the site's premiere agents. For the month of April 2014, the company had 80 million unique users log on to Zillow.com, a net gain of 26.5 million users from a year ago. During the workweek, around 66% of the company's overall traffic comes from mobile devices. That number peaks above 70% for the weekend. Chief Marketing Officer Amy Bohutinsky explains why its service is used primarily on a mobile platform and how the company has geared new ad dollars towards this trend;Investors should feel good about Zillow's strategy to expand its advertising as the company has seen rising earnings and revenue, and has beat analysts' expectations every quarter since Q3 2012. Currently trading at $118/share, near its all time high, one of Zillow's main revenue streams is the Premier Agent Subscribers who pay to advertise on the website. This division has grown 56% in the last 12 months to 52,968 Premier Agent Subscribers. Further, the average monthly revenue per subscriber is $286, up 10% since Q1 2013. Revenue generated from Premier Agent subscriptions were $46.2 million in Q1, up 77% from Q1 2013. The company's other revenue divisions had huge growth in the most recent quarter as Display Ad revenue was up 62% to 12.9 million and Zillow's Mortgage Marketplace, up 45%, with revenues of $7.1 million. This type of growth can be attributed to the successful advertising campaigns that have gained the confidence of more agents, and increased the buyers and sellers of homes looking for everything from listings to mortgages rates, all of which is part of the service Zillow provides.Investors should also be looking to the company's strength in spite of a slow start to the real estate market in 2014. The spring selling season has had an unusually sluggish start, in part due to the slump in home sales at the beginning of 2014. However, the industry seems to be picking up again as the Commerce Department Data shows purchases of new homes climbed by 6.4% for the month of May, which is the first gain in three months, to a 433,000 annualized rate. Previously owned homes also saw the first positive gain in the month of April, in which sales rose 1.3%, as indicated by the National Association of Realtors. According to the S&P/Case-Shiller index, property values increased 12.4% from March 2013, over 12 months ago, but despite being way off pre-recession prices, it is important to note the upward trajectory in home values. Michael Gapen, senior US economist at Barclays Capital, elaborates on the price increases, rise in mortgage rates, and tighter lending standards;Zillow had record numbers in the last two quarters, with 58.3 million and 66.2 million in revenue for Q4 2013 and Q1 2014 respectively. Further, its bottom line has blown past estimates over the same time period with $0.19/share and $0.02/share beating expectations by $0.13 and $0.10 for the same period. Zillow has shown that not only can it increase shareholder value during a difficult housing market, but that it also has strategically put money to work in advertising and seen huge monetary gains. As the market continues to go higher, Zillow is one company that continues to provide the type of performance that keeps it at number one in its respective industry.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2249903,52012,2014-06-03T00:49:14-04:00,"Z has risen too high based on a violent short squeeze.While Z is a good short candidate on its own, the safer trade is short Z, long MOVE.MOVE has better valuation relative to Z.I believe MOVE's prospects are under-estimated by the market.Insider selling corroborates the pair trade thesis.","During the past month or so, Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) has rocketed to new highs.source: yahoo.comThe original turnaround came with better than consensus earnings on May 7th, but the move has been exaggerated by a violent short squeeze thereafter. Jim Cramer noted it on May 23rd:Moreover, there were an increasing number of shares short into the squeeze, see the Nasdaq data below:When trying to take advantage of price overshoots generated by short squeezes, it's better to enter later than earlier; but by this point the force of the squeeze seems to have dissipated, and yet the ""artificially"" high price remains. On its own, this might indicate a potentially good short entry, particularly given the company's stratospheric valuation, but the safer play in my opinion is a pair trade with equal dollars short Z and long Move (NASDAQ:MOVE) (a company which operates the realtor.com site among others).While Zillow is probably the currently best-known site for internet real-estate data, three factors argue for the pair trade: relative valuations, long-term competitive advantages and insider selling. To put this another way, currently the market has awarded Z a long-term victory in the market, and has therefore bid the price up on every valuation measure, but there's a real question as to whether or not that victory has been declared prematurely. And any inferences we can make from insider selling corroborate this conclusion.The first point regarding relative valuations is best understood from graphical presentations, so here are charts comparing the two companies on key valuation parameters:Z Price to Book Value data by YCharts Z PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsZ Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) data by YChartsBy every measure MOVE is clearly the better value buy than Z.But the second reason to consummate the pair trade is that MOVE is slowly and more adroitly seeking to compete with Z. For the past few years, I have heard ample anecdotal evidence from people who were actually looking to buy, sell or rent a home, that the realtor.com site has much more current and accurate listings than does Z -- and hence is much more useful. On the other hand, for looky-loos just window shopping, or trying to feel good about how much their home has appreciated on the zestimate scale, Zillow is the go-to site. My guess is that the former types of users can be monetized much more readily than the latter, and it would appear that MOVE has (finally) come to the same conclusion. Hence an ad campaign stressing listing accuracy. See this clip for instance. I believe that as word gets out, the realtor.com site will see higher traffic increases than Z, and as a result MOVE will begin to eat into the valuation disparity (both absolutely, and on a multiple expansion/contraction basis).Finally, insiders at Z and MOVE have different attitudes towards their companies, with the former selling at a desperate clip:Given the valuation differences, my belief that MOVE's prospects relative to Z are underestimated and confirmation from insider selling, I have put on a pair trade short Z and long MOVE (though I have more dollars short Z than long MOVE). I may add to MOVE in the next 72 hours to better balance the two. I will look to unwind the trade as the relative valuations (P/B, P/S etc.) become roughly commensurate.For reference, here is the relative one-year price appreciation of the two stocks:Disclosure: I am short Z. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: I am short Z and long MOVE, though by dollar size my Z short is larger than my MOVE long. I may add to MOVE in the next 72 hours to better balance the positions"
2191563,44981,2014-05-05T15:28:08-04:00,"Strong presence in the mobile segment will allow the company to keep up with the trend and grow revenues.3-year average annual revenue growth of over 66% justifies the rise in the stock price.The business model of the company allows the market participants to choose the preferred product, which will result in bringing more customers.","Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) has been one of the best performing stock of the last twelve months with a gain of over 76% -- despite the overall market slowing down since the start of the year; it is up over 30%. Zillow is an online database of real estate. The company provides a platform to the prospective buyers and sellers, and with some of its products, the company also helps prospective buyers and sellers in making decisions. Zillow mainly derives its revenues through advertisement on its website. On the other hand, it has a partnership with a few newspapers authorizing them to use Zillow's real estate search engine. After its exclusive partnership with Yahoo Real estate, it has now become the biggest real estate advertiser on the internet.Acquisitions and Partnerships: Drivers of growthHaving a simple business model, Zillow's main strategy for growth is to increase real estate information geographically and also in terms of details. For this purpose, it has made 7 acquisitions in the last three years, the most recent one being, StreetEasy. Considering the company's business, the real estate data has to be standardized in order to increase its accuracy, consistency and accessibility. Zillow has recently partnered up with Real Estate Standards Organization. As the data gets standardized according to MLS standards, the customers of the company will increase. More brokers will be accessing the website and subsequently this will increase the traffic of Zillow's website. As a result, its revenues from advertisements will increase substantially in the coming quarters.Market PotentialU.S. real estate market is huge and growing rapidly. There are two markets in real estate: Sale and purchase, and Rentals. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, sale of roughly 4.7 million existing homes and 368 thousand new homes represented a total value of $1.2 trillion. There are about 1.2 million real estate brokers in the U.S., and according to a research report by Borrell associates, these real estate brokers spent roughly $7.8 billion for residential advertising while new developers spent around $1.3 billion during the last year. This means that an average broker is willing to spend $6,500 in advertising every year keeping aside the huge market of new developers.Competitive AdvantageThe ability to go mobile and monetize the mobile user base is the necessity for all the technology companies - people now prefer to use their mobile devices to access their favorite websites. Zillow has a strong presence in the mobile segment as 65% of the website's total traffic comes from mobile and it goes up to 70% during the weekends. The company has a total of 27 apps that the customers can easily use to search for their choice of Purchase and Rentals, mortgage and home improvements. This has resulted in increased traffic on Zillow's website. In December 2013, a total of 275 million homes were viewed on Zillow's website through mobile devices. In other words, 103 homes per second were viewed in December.Zillow currently charges its clients on the basis of cost per thousand impressions (CPM). That is, for every thousand view of a particular advertisement, the client has to pay a certain fee. This method is best known for internet advertising and has many advantages with respect to pay-per-click (PPC) featured ads. In addition, the company has offered brokers and agents with different accounts on the website holding different privileges. This allows the brokers and agents to make their advertising choice according to their budgets while the company caters to a broader market this way.Zillow is already positioned as the biggest internet real estate advertiser and information hub. Still it is continuing to take steps to broaden its share in the market through further acquisitions and mergers. The recent MLS standardization merger would allow the company to have a better target audience for its advertising as the data gets organized. With growing target audience, its clients will also grow subsequently.A Look at the FundamentalsThe growth in the stock price has been impressive for the company. However, the growth in revenues has been equally impressive for Zillow. The company has recorded 3-year average annual revenue growth of over 66%. Revenues of the company have jumped from just $66 million at the end of 2011 to $197.5 million by the end of 2013. The growth in revenues is commensurate with the growth in mobile users (57%) - the company has been able to monetize its mobile users effectively. At the moment, the biggest expense for Zillow is marketing and sales, which accounts for 55% of the total revenues of the company. Sales and marketing expense will likely come down as the company increases its presence in the market. It is understandable why the marketing and sales expenses are so high at the early stages of the company.Technology and development expense is the second largest expense for the company and equals to 25% of the total revenues. The core expenses are quite low for the company such as cost of sales (10%), general and admin expenses (19%) - sales and marketing expenses will come down over the next few quarters, and with growing revenues, the proportion of the other expenses will also decrease. Full-year loss for Zillow stood at $12.5 million; however, adjusted EBITDA was $29.7 million, which included depreciation and amortization, and stock based compensation expense. The gross margin of the company is very high (90%) and a decrease in sales and marketing expenses should also result in an impressive operating margin over the next few quarters.ConclusionThe market for Zillow is considerably large and the company has made solid progress. Its traffic is increasing and the company also has strong presence in the mobile segment. Furthermore, Zillow has been able to monetize its user base, allowing the company to report massive growth in its revenues. As the growth opportunities still exist for the company; we believe Zillow is a good investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2134113,40031,2014-04-09T16:55:43-04:00,"Zillow and Trulia are experiencing strong top line growth, and they have increased spending to capture market share.Can their rich valuations be justified with their strong growth?High short interest and rising share prices are a recipe for strong short term gains.Both Zillow's and Trulia's share prices have behaved well despite a strong selloff in momentum names.","Shares of Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and Trulia (TRLA) appear to have bottomed after consolidating in the last six months. The consolidation came on the heels of strong price advances which drove their share prices more than 200% higher in the first nine months of 2013. Both companies are growing their revenues rapidly, as they continue to benefit from strong growth trends in online real estate. Zillow and Trulia are experiencing high volatility, and this is in part due to high short interest. With their share prices stabilizing and turning up, the uptrend may accelerate on short-covering. Their share price performance in recent weeks is particularly encouraging, given the strong selloff in the momentum space.Two dominant themes: strong revenue growth and increased advertising spendingZillow has grown its top line rapidly in the past two years. Revenue growth in 2012 and 2013 was 77% and 69% respectively. Analysts are expecting a 49% increase in revenue in 2014. The company delivered Q4 earnings and revenue ahead of estimates, and guided 2014 revenue above consensus. Quarterly traffic grew 57% Y/Y to 54.4 million average monthly unique users on mobile and web. Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 was $15.2 million, a significant increase over $6.8 million in Q4 2012. EBITDA margin expanded 600 basis points to 26%. Zillow continued to gain market share in 2013. According to comScore, Zillow has combined and mobile web traffic that is double the size of its two closest competitors. The company's mobile strategy is delivering strong growth, as visits via mobile devices nearly doubled year-over-year, and nearly 400 million homes were viewed on Zillow on a mobile device. Two thirds of Zillow visits now occur on a mobile device.Trulia is also making progress, and the company is delivering strong revenue growth. Trulia's revenue growth in 2013 was 111%, while analysts are expecting a 72% increase in 2014. Q4 EBITDA was $7.7 million compared to just $0.6 million in Q4 2012. Monthly unique visitors in Q4 were 35.3 million, a 49% increase over Q4 2012. Mobile monthly unique visitors were 14.3 million, an 86% increase from 7.7 million in the same period last year.Both companies are investing aggressively in marketing. Zillow launched a TV-ad campaign last year and has spent $40 million on marketing in 2013. Zillow expects to spend $65 million in 2014, while Trulia announced that it will spend $45 million through its national marketing campaign. This shows that both companies are getting very aggressive, and intend to increase their market share. The increased spending is going to have a negative effect on their bottom lines.What might lead to short-covering?A combination of falling share prices and rising revenue and EBITDA has caused a significant contraction in Zillow's and Trulia's valuations. Zillow's forward EV/EBITDA was cut in half, from more than 150 to 68, while Trulia's forward EV/EBITDA fell from 120 to 52. Although these are still high multiples, these companies are still in their early stages of growth, and have plenty of room to grow into their valuations. Based on both forward P/S and EV/EBITDA ratios, Trulia seems to be a better trade than Zillow, although we can justify Zillow's premium due to its leadership position.Source: ycharts.comSource: Stockcharts.comZillow looks better momentum-wise, as it is near its all-time highs, while Trulia has a long way to go to reach its September 2013 highs. Since their valuations have contracted significantly and as their share prices point that the consolidation might be turning to another uptrend, the two factors might lead to short covering. The increased marketing spending will certainly affect the bottom line in 2014, but I expect the long-term profitability to be much better once the ""ad wars"" are over, and once they establish a stronger footprint in the market. Good news surrounding the housing market could add fuel to the fire, since both companies are dependent on the movements of the housing sector. I believe this may be the case going forward, as the housing market might have been affected by bad weather in recent months, and the recovery might continue in the following months.Short covering might lead to significant buying demand. Zillow's short interest stands at 7.2 million shares, or 18% of its free float. Trulia's has 10.3 million shares short, or 28% of its free float. These numbers translate into approximately five days of short-covering based on the current average trading volume for both stocks.ConclusionA combination of strong growth and high short interest can lead to significant price gains. Zillow's and Trulia's forward multiples are consistent with their expected strong revenue and earnings growth in the next couple of years. Both companies are investing aggressively and should benefit from growing awareness and an expanding user base. I expect the housing recovery to be back on track soon, as it was most likely negatively impacted by bad weather in previous months, which might help Zillow's and Trulia's share price going forward.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in Z, TRLA over the next 72 hours.

Again, this is in stark contrast to Rightmove.Zillow shares look to have 80% downside, even assuming significant revenue growth and profitability improvement.","While most momentum stocks are well off their 52-week highs, Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) shares hit a new all-time high Monday. At $103/share, investors are assuming a fast-growing and highly profitable future for Zillow. Is this reasonable? While Zillow has increased the number of consumers visiting its website, there are several reasons for investors to be cautious, including:What is Zillow worth?Below, I estimate fair value for Zillow. I assume that the company is able to increase revenue 45% in 2014 and a further 30% in 2015. While Zillow earned an operating loss last year, I generously assume that the company is able to bring profitability levels to 12.5% by 2015.This produces a $0.68 EPS estimate for 2015, which is actually in line with sell-side estimates. The big difference is that I assume Zillow is a fairly mature business by this stage. Given its high (estimated) churn rate, by 2015, I believe most real estate agents will have tried Zillow and that growth going forward will be significantly lower (sub-10%). As such, I apply a 20x P/E multiple, which gets me to just under $14 per share. Note that I do not give Zillow credit for its cash balance, as I assume the company must spend this on acquisitions to achieve revenue growth. If Zillow is able to achieve this growth without using the cash, shares could be worth closer to $20. With 80%+ downside, I believe Zillow is an attractive short sale opportunity.Disclosure: I am short Z. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Clearly short sellers were expecting shares to cool off and unfortunately for them, shares took an unexpected twist over the last week.Based on what has transpired over the last couple of days, I wouldn't be one bit surprised to see a jump in the short interest figures as short sellers look to make up for lost gains as well as capitalizing on a quick pop and drop from the investor euphoria.Zillow + Trulia = Growth Opportunity Or Short Opportunity?Much has already been said about what kind of impact the merger would have between both companies. So without further ado, here is a quick recap of what has been said:1) Both Companies Will Become Internet Advertising Juggernauts2) The Merger Will Provide For Greater Pricing Power3) Broader Distribution And Greater Access To Real Estate Data4) Combining Resources Will Result In Faster Innovation5) Both Companies Will Have Better Cost Control MeasuresA merger between Zillow and Trulia would undoubtedly create a dominant search website for U.S. house hunters, while reshaping the online real estate industry in the process.Together, Zillow and Trulia had more than 85 million unique visitors in June, accounting close to 89% of all traffic to the 15 most-visited real estate sites tracked by ComScore.So what is the total cost of the merger and are there any downsides to this deal?According to Zillow's press release Monday morning, the No. 1 real estate website (Zillow), agreed to buy the No. 2 real estate website (Trulia), for $3.5B in a stock-for-stock transaction. Even though there are many things to like about the acquisition made by Zillow, there are still some downsides that investors need to consider. Below are a couple of reasons that make a compelling case to go short.Short Opportunity?Shorting momentum stocks like Zillow, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), just to name a few, has been a tough go around for many short sellers. It seems like no matter what takes place (bad news), shares seem to press onward and upward.This time was no different for Zillow as shares soared 30% over several days on the news that the Company was looking to purchase Trulia. The question now remains, will shorts be able to recoup the losses they have already suffered on Zillow's behalf? I believe so and here are a couple of reasons why.Valuation, Valuation, ValuationLooking at the numbers, one can make a great case of just how overvalued Zillow and Trulia are. So how do these companies compare to their peers and others within the industry? The table below shows just how expensive and overvalued these companies have become.* Figures as of July 28, 2014When we compare Zillow and Trulia not only against each other, but against their peers and those in the industry, one can see right away that these companies trade at sky-high valuations.Antitrust Issues (Merger Could Be Denied)Antitrust Laws or ""competition laws"" as some call it, are statutes developed by the U.S. Government to protect consumers from predatory business practices by ensuring that fair competition exists in an open-market economy.Let's face it, as consumers the more competition the better. Why is this the case? One word; Monopolies. For those of you that are new to the term, a monopoly is where a single company or group owns all or nearly all of the market for a given type of product or service. The absence of competition, often results in higher prices and lower quality products.In the United States, there are many regulations that help to protect the free markets from being dominated by a single entity. When there is only one provider for goods or services, there seems to be a lack of incentive for companies to improve or meet the demands of its consumers. Governments attempt to prevent monopolies from arising through the use of antitrust laws.Over the years, a number of deals have failed to go through due to antitrust issues. For example, in 2011, AT&T (NYSE:T), tried to acquire T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), for $39B. To make a long story short, the deal went south due to pushback from rivals and regulators. On top of that, AT&T was required to pay T-Mobile a $4B breakup fee since the deal did not go through.This just goes to show you that it isn't always fine and dandy in the M&A world. Late Monday evening, Trulia filed an 8-K talking about termination fees among other things.Like I mentioned above, Zillow and Trulia still face some trouble in that they must get shareholder approval as well as passing regulatory scrutiny.One thing that I would like to point out is Zillow's financials. If the deal does not go through for whatever reason, Zillow would be on the hook to pay Trulia $150M. Based on Zillow's latest financials, one can see that the Company had just $446M in cash/investments at the end of the first quarter. That means, the $150M breakup fee if paid, would wipe away 33% of Zillow's cash holdings. Not only that, but the +30% rise due to the merger speculations and announcements would send shares plummeting.Where's The Profits?Looking to find profits on Zillow's or Trulia's quarterly reports is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Abram Garver, managing director of BG Strategic Advisors talked about the outlook of the two money losing companies saying:Insider SellingIf you haven't already noticed by now, insiders seem to be selling as many shares as they can get their hands on these days. This definitely should bring up a red flag for investors in Zillow. If the leaders and executives of the company are taking their money out, then why should you keep your money in?Investors will point out that there are many reasons that officers might sell their shares. For instance, they may need the money to pay their children's tuition, pay taxes, buy a house or to satisfy a debt. While this may be true, the fact that so many insiders have sold shares within such a short period of time leaves me wondering why.Remember that insiders have access to every bit of information that you could ever want. So if they are selling shares then why aren't you? So much insider selling in such a short period of time has to be in the back of investors' minds as it's usually a warning sign that a fall is about to take place.I don't mean to bash Zillow, but it seems as though insiders have no faith in the stock continuing on at these levels. I've seen insider selling before and this one takes the cake as insiders have sold hundreds of millions worth of stock over the last couple of years. Does that sound like confidence in a fast growing company to you?Just in 2014 alone, insiders at Trulia have sold more than $28M worth of stock, with CEO Peter Flint unloading $11.2M in shares. Insiders at Zillow have almost tripled that, as insiders have sold more than $70M in stock since the beginning of the year. The company's CEO, Spencer Rascoff, unloaded $19.9M in stock and after his recent sales a couple of weeks ago, Rascoff doesn't own any Zillow shares directly.ConclusionAfter quarter after quarter and year after year of losses, not to mention missing analyst estimates, these two companies got together to save themselves. What they managed to do was magnificent as both companies' values combined to soar more than $2.5B in less than a week.With Zillow posting a loss last year and is expecting to report an even bigger loss this year, the huge run-up in price should attract a lot of short sellers and day traders. On top of that, Trulia has never been profitable, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.I've been a fan of Trulia for a while now and even wrote an article to investors that shares would produce big gains in 2014. Well those gains have come to pass now and it's time to start locking in those profits. Much like the stock cycle; what goes up must surely come back down.With valuations sky-high and with stock dilution around the corner (if the deal goes through), Zillow looks to be in a lose-lose situation in the short term. Of course Zillow has burned shorts before so if you do intend on shorting shares, make sure you are hedged in case those unexpected announcements pop up again. With earnings season just around the corner for both companies, Zillow and Trulia have high expectations placed upon themselves. Any blunders at these prices will have huge consequences. Even a great report could still send shares falling as investors ''sell on the news.''As always, I'm providing you with my track record and other particular stocks that I recommend. The link provided will show you all of my picks, how they have fared, and where I think they will be going in the near future. I think you will find my track record to be very impressive and useful.Disclaimer: LinkDisclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in Z over the next 72 hours.

2072473,61101,2014-03-06T14:05:04-05:00,"The business model is highly scalable.Long-term earnings growth could be phenomenal.The high current price greatly limits upside, even in the best case scenario.Zillow will likely be out-performed by safer dividend paying and high yielding stocks in the long run.","I'm a firm believer in dividend stocks, both high-yielding income stocks and dividend growth stocks. However, as part of a diversified portfolio I am open to owning growth stocks who have the potential for outsized long-term returns. While researching through some stocks recently I came across Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and became intrigued at what appears to be one of the most promising growth stories of the next decade or two. However, the more I researched and modeled the company's potential, the more I became convinced that regardless of its phenomenal growth prospects, at its current price Zillow won't make a good long-term investment. As I'll soon show, this verdict remains true no matter how long the time horizon.Company Overview:Zillow is a Seattle based company that operates a website and suite of software solutions designed to bring home buyers and real estate agents together. Initially, the company's claim to fame was the ""Zestimate"" which was supposed to use existing home sales data to give home owners an estimate of the value of their homes. The idea was to build a database of users, improve the company's ""Zestimates"" and grow a loyal following. The traffic from this strategy would then be used to sell advertising and convince real estate agents to sign up for a premium subscription to the site, as a way for agents to network with potential leads. This secondary strategy was designed to work like LinkedIn (LNKD), acting as a market connecting real estate agents to potential buyers and sellers of homes. The network effects of having the largest database of potential customers and agents would create a powerful moat around the company's business model similar to Ebay's (NASDAQ:EBAY). Today Ebay has a massive competitive advantage in its marketplace business because they are the largest market. Sellers and Buyers want to post on Ebay because it's where the most people are.Zillow's business model called for creating something similar in real estate, beginning with homes but later branching out. Today the company offers, in addition to its original service:So how well is the company executing on its growth plans?Recent Results:- For 2013 Total Revenue increased 69% to a record $197.5 million from $116.9 million in 2012.- Marketplace Revenue increased 78% to a record $154.2 million from $86.7 million in 2012.- Real Estate Revenue grew 74% to $132.4 million from $75.9 million in 2012.- Mortgages Revenue grew 103% to $21.8 million from $10.8 million in 2012.- Display Revenue increased 44% to $43.3 million from $30.2 million in 2012.-Premier Agent growth of 64%, to 48,314-Record 70 million users in January, representing 52% growth since 2012.In addition to these impressive growth numbers, comScore reported that Zillow had more than double the combined web traffic of its two largest competitors, Trulia (TRLA) and Move.Inc (NASDAQ:MOVE).The company continues to innovate with the January introduction of the Postlets App on IOS. This app allows landlords, property managers and real estate agents to post ads for their rentals on the top 20 real estate web and social networking sites.Looking forward into 2014 management is planning on increasing its advertising budget from $40 million to $65 million in an effort to expand brand awareness and offset Trulia's $45 million advertising spending.Thus far the company has been able to execute well on its growth plan resulting in fantastic growth in revenues and the share price.In the last 3 years sales at Zillow are up 86.4% CAGR while the share price has appreciated at 40.6% CAGR over the same time. Meanwhile analysts continue to be bullish on the company's prospects. Wall Street is anticipating 42% sales growth in 2014 and 36% in 2015. Earnings are expected to increase a breathtaking 1050% from $.06/share to $.69 in 2015 and then continue to grow at 42% annually over the next 5 years. If the optimistic predictions of analysts is all that Zillow had going for it then it would not be much of a potential investment. However, over the last 4 quarters the company has managed to crush analyst expectations by an average of 113% each time.Given the fact that there are 2.1 million real estate agents in the U.S. and Zillow has signed up just 48,000 of them as premier subscribers, the growth potential for the company becomes obvious (it has just 2.3% market share in premium subscribers).So Zillow is a strong buy correct? After all, the growth prospects are there, the market size is enormous and its market share is tiny but growing fast. This indicates a long runway for growth, potentially for several decades. However, I believe that Zillow makes a poor long-term investment because of one major factor, price.The above spreadsheet is an attempt to model Zillow's future earnings growth over the next 25 years and assign a present day fair value to the shares. The goal is to determine a reasonable estimate for the rate of return investors can expect at today's price.Beginning in 2014 and using the projected $.69 in EPS in 2015 I model 40% earnings growth over the next 3 years. After that, I anticipate growth to slow to a 30% CAGR for 5 more years. The 5 year periods after that see growth slow to 20%, 15% and finally 10% respectively. I attempted to assign a variety of earnings multiples ranging from pessimistic to optimistic during each 5 year period in order to determine a projected price in 2018, 2023, 2028, 2033 and 2038. I used a 9% discount rate (between 1871-2013 the stock market returned a 9% CAGR) to determine the fair value of shares today. I then compared the price today to the fair price to determine to what extent shares are trading at a premium or discount. Finally I calculate the anticipated return investors can expect over a 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 year period. I compare this anticipated total return to those that can be found from high yielding income and dividend growth stocks to see if Zillow's potential returns make up for the increased risks associated with the company's heady valuation.The results are sobering. Over the next 25 years I model a 31.5% CAGR in EPS which is a staggering growth rate for any company. Yet, the compound annual growth rate of the stock is expected to be just 9.45%. This barely beats the general market's long-term performance (if dividends are reinvested, the stock market's 1871-2013 CAGR is 11.1%). If market dividends are included than Zillow is expected to underperform the market's historical returns.Over shorter periods of time investors can expect to do slightly better with the 10 year return averaging 18.65% CAGR. This is about double the market's traditional growth rate. However, when I compare this projected return to boring but steady dividend payers such as Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP), Main Street Capital (NYSE:MAIN), or Prospect Capital (NASDAQ:PSEC), I find expected returns that match or easily surpass that of Zillow. This is because high dividend stocks such as those I mentioned typically give a total return of yield+CAGR of dividends. Brookfield and Main Street have long-term dividend CAGRs of 8-9% while Prospect has just 1% but it has a 12% yield. The yield on Brookfield is 5.1% and on Main Street 7.2-7.3% when semiannual special dividends are accounted for. This gives an expected total return for these dividend stocks of 14-15% CAGR for Brookfield, 16% for Main Street and 13% for Prospect Capital. However, when you take into account dividend reinvestment (including monthly compounding for Prospect and Main Street), you get long-term total returns of about 22% for Brookfield, 24% for Main Street and 27% for Prospect Capital. These 3 companies seem to offer better future returns than Zillow and would likely do so with less volatility, less risk and pay out great dividends along the way.Given that non-dividend paying growth stocks are supposed to compensate for their higher volatility and risk (and lack of income) Zillow, as a long-term risk adjusted investment, just does not make sense at its current price. This is not to say that the stock could not become a great long-term candidate in the future. If Zillow were to drop just 11.3% to $74.11/share then the expected 5 year total return increases to 18-48% CAGR with an average of 36%. This shows the importance of the valuation even for a great growth story. At the wrong price the greatest company in the world becomes the worst investment.This is not to say, however, that Zillow at today's price is not a great short-term trading opportunity. With 51% of shares held short and a short ratio of 4.8 days, Zillow is the 4th highest shorted stock in America. It is a powder keg waiting to blow up in the bears faces. With the company's history of annihilating analysts expectations, a blowout quarter could send the stock up 10-20% and initiate the mother of all short squeezes. To give an example of how big the potential short term pop could be, Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) historic run came off the back of a 40% short interest. Zillow's is 25% higher and the short ratio indicates that there are so few shares remaining to be traded daily, (because of high % institutional shareholders and the insanely high short interest), that it would take an entire trading week for shorts to cover. This means that Zillow presents one of the greatest potential short-term trading opportunities I have ever seen. However, it is one of the worst long-term investment thesis you're likely to find, at least at the current price.Technical Analysis:The short-term technical indicators are neutral for Zillow. There is incredible support at $83.3 with mild resistance above at $85.3. The most recent candlestick pattern is a very bearish Gravestone Doji. However, it seems that support is holding solid.This technical analysis seems to indicate a very good trade for those who wish to buy Zillow and ride a future short squeeze to fast profits. The stock is likely to not drop below the incredible level 15 support it is currently sitting on. Meanwhile the company's track record makes another blowout quarter likely. Of course short term speculation is not the same as investing and comes with a great deal of risk. Should the company miss expectations or the market experience a strong correction the stock might drop hard and fast.Conclusion:Zillow is a wonderfully innovative and disruptive company. Its amazing growth story is likely to continue for many years to come and at the right price, it would make an amazing long-term investment. However, at the current price the stock simply cannot offer long-term investors sufficient risk adjusted returns to warrant an investment at this time. It can, however, offer short-term traders a great opportunity to cash in on a potential short squeeze, which is likely to occur within the next few quarters.For existing shareholders, I would rate Zillow a hold because of the power of its growth potential. For new investors, I would recommend waiting for a better price such as $74-$75. For short-term traders interested in riding a short squeeze, Zillow is a definite ""buy now"". This is assuming you are willing to take the risk of a large loss should future growth expectations not be met.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Their competitive advantage includes their comprehensive home data and valuation tools in the form of their Zestimate and Rent Zestimate values, providing guideline home values and rental rates. Zillow earns its revenue primarily through sale of ads to Real Estate Agents and banner-based ads. The residential real estate market in the U.S. is highly fragmented with 422,000 agents in 2012, of which approximately 59% are self-employed. Brokerage services make up 45% of industry revenue, with leasing coming in second at 35% and property management at 15%.Zillow, through its Premier Agents program, allows agents to advertise at the zip and area levels, targeting both property sales and rentals. Furthermore, the Zillow Marketplace showcases agents for property management, buying, and renovation. The table we've created below demonstrates the growth in Premier Agents subscriptions in Zillow, and their growing importance as the main revenue contributor:SeasonalityThe average revenue per premier agent inferred from the real estate marketplace revenue seems to exhibit seasonality, with the final quarter of the year being the costliest for the advertising agents. Also, the share of real estate marketplace revenue in total revenue of Zillow is seasonally higher (nearing 70%) in the final quarter. Thus, Zillow's efforts at differential pricing based on demand for the location are translating to overall better numbers in the last quarter.PenetrationThe December 2013 Premier Agent count of 48,314 gives Zillow a penetration of 11.5% of all registered U.S. real estate agents, considering there is no churn among agents. Very crudely, this translates to an agent's pool of about 373k agents who can potentially subscribe to Zillow. However, as we will demonstrate later from our proprietary data, Zillow also experiences significant churn amongst its Premier Agent subscribers. We believe that bringing on an ex-Premier Agent back as a paying customer to Zillow is a stiff challenge -- hence the pool of unapproached agents is far lesser than 88.5%.Our MethodologyWe collect extensive data from the Zillow website to obtain a forecast for the number of Premier Agents for the quarter. As the first step, we use an exhaustive list of U.S. zip codes and a list of cities/neighborhoods that are prominently indexed on Zillow. Using this list of locations, we scrape through the Zillow website multiple times looking for Premier Agents being displayed in each of them. Finally, we tally the list of Unique Premier Agents to arrive at our forecast. Our historical data allows us to derive a retention rate of Premier Agents as well.Adjustment Factors for Our Model ResultsOur historical model results track the company reported quarterly numbers quite closely with a steady error rate of about 15%. We believe the errors arise due to the gradual onboarding and indexing of new Premier Agents with a lag, and also because of non-indexed premier agents who sign up with Zillow just for the listings and do not opt for any targeted geographical advertising. Hence, we inflate our tally of Unique Premier Agents, using a correction factor.Furthermore, this quarter our scraping codes were run on the Zillow website during March 15 through March 20, 2014, and hence require extrapolation to represent quarterly numbers. Here we assume that the rate of onboarding of new Premier Agents on Zillow remains constant during the quarter.Our Model ForecastWe have estimated the number of Premier Agents subscribed to Zillow as of March 31, 2014, to be 56,908. This represents a growth of 17.8% compared to previous quarters. A year ago, the growth rate for the first quarter was 15.5%.Please click here to download the entire list of Premier Agents we compiled for this quarter. This increase in Premier Agents also ties in well with the frothy real estate conditions as shown by the Case-Shriller index and increasing volumes of transactions in the U.S. real estate sector.Retention RatioComparing our current list of Premier Agents to March 2013 and September 2013 shows us retention ratios of 62.26% and 74.85%, respectively. The two retention ratios indicate that a lot of agents did not rollover the subscription into 2014, though they mostly had a subscription both in March and September 2013.In sum, our data indicates the success of Zillow in signing up new agents, but at the same time their weak retention of existing agents. This reveals that the current subscribers are continuously reevaluating their spending on Zillow, and do not hesitate to opt out when they do not achieve results.Revenue ForecastUsing historical Premier Agents fraction of revenue of 67% (rolling average of the last four quarters) and an average subscription rate of $800 per Premier Agent, we forecast the revenue of Zillow for first quarter 2014 to be $67.95 million.In terms of net profit, as the expanded sales require large advertising spends, we believe the firm will break even or make a marginal profit, as seen from historical margins. Hence we do not forecast an EPS.Downside Risks1. Short Squeeze: Zillow has moderate to high levels of institutional holdings (74%), but has a high amount of short interest at 5.76 days to cover in March 2014. We believe the short squeeze is preventing the price from reflecting all the information, and proving a detriment for efficient pricing of the stock and making it highly volatile. However, the sustained high valuation of Zillow has allowed the company to go an acquisition spree and consolidate its position in the Industry.2. Softening of Commission Money: Renters/buyers feel that current commissions for agents are high with respect to their services. Although negotiable, a buy/sell typically pays 6% to both the buyer's and seller's agent. Internationally, the numbers are often half the levels as in the U.S. Going forward, any such softening of commissions can adversely affect the marketing dollars spent by agents, and directly impact Zillow.3. Adverse Mortgage Rate Changes: Any increase in the mortgage rates following the fed tapering can place further pressure on advertising by real estate agents and could provide further downward pressure on Zillow.4. Insiders Dumping Shares: Zillow insiders are not reluctant to let the market know of their view of firm value. In 2013, insiders sold shares worth $304 million and to date in 2014 have sold $29 million. There has not been a single purchase activity by a Zillow insider in the last 30 months.ConclusionWhile on the execution front Zillow has brought on a lot of Premier Agents in this quarter, the headwinds in the industry, perception of high commissions, and a volatile stock make Zillow appropriate for risk-lovers, purely for the short term. Combining the number of agents on Zillow and their typical annual churn ratio of 40% tells us that Zillow has reached far more than the 10% of all U.S. real estate agents it seems to have as current subscribers. One can speculate in Zillow purely in the short term for gains around the earnings announcement, while remaining cautious of the steep downside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2013581,23625,2014-02-12T03:01:40-05:00,,"Zillow Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) is set to report FQ4 2013 earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, February 12th. Zillow is an online real estate database. Back in 2011, Zillow announced an exclusive partnership with Yahoo Real Estate creating the largest real-estate advertising business on the web. One of the services that Zillow provides is its Zestimates, estimates created for housing prices based on publicly available historical and regional data. Zillow has grown its revenue steadily in each quarter over the past year and this quarter Wall Street is expecting sales growth upwards of 63%. Here's how investors expect Zillow to report Wednesday.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors. (Click Here to see All Estimates for Zillow)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Z to report 7c EPS and $56.13M revenue while the current Estimize.com consensus from Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 8c EPS and $57.23M revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting Z to beat Wall Street's expectations on EPS and revenue.Throughout the previous 6 quarters, the consensus from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Z's revenue every time and has been more accurate in forecasting EPS 3 times. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non professional investors, Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly, it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case, we are seeing a smaller differential than usual for Z. This quarter analysts are expecting profit and revenue to be up compared to FQ4 2012. The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from 4c to 11c EPS and $55.00M to $59.16M in revenues. This quarter we're seeing an average distribution of estimates for Z compared to recent quarters.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A wider distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market, which could mean greater volatility post earnings.Throughout the quarter the EPS consensus from Wall Street increased from 2c to 7c while the Estimize EPS consensus inched higher from 7c to 8c. Over the same time period Wall Street raised its revenue expectation from $54.46M to $56.13M while Estimize shot up from $56.43M to $57.23M. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and rising analyst expectations at the end of a period are often a bullish indicator.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is dschorrnyc who projects 8c EPS and $58.20M in revenue. In the Winter 2014 season, dschorrnyc is yet to make an estimate and is ranked 1153rd overall among over 3,800 contributing analysts. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case, dschorrnyc is making a bullish call expecting Zillow to report in-line with the Estimize consensus on profit but exceed on sales.Analysts are expecting Zillow to grow in 2014 especially considering the company's expansion into home rentals and home improvement data markets. The number of unique viewers on the site in December 2013 was up 50% from one year previously and the company's steadily growing revenue is a good sign for investors. This quarter contributing analysts on Estimize.com are expecting continued revenue growth and for Zillow to outperform Wall Street expectations by a small margin.Disclosure: No positions"

2014341,23690,2014-02-12T10:16:26-05:00,,"Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) reports tonight, Wednesday, February 12th after the close. The shares have been in a tug-of-war between boosters and short sellers, including the famous Citron.Zillow came public back in July of 2011, in what was a red-hot IPO. The deal priced above the range at $20 and popped to $57 before closing the day at $35. Since then, the company has completed two secondary offerings - one at $43 in September of 2012 and another at $82 in August of 2013.Zillow has been anointed by investors as the ""category leader"" in the online real estate category. We're all familiar with what that can mean over time, and many anticipate success on the scale of a Priceline.com (PCLN) in the travel industry.The Zillow valuation stands at about $3.3B at $85/share. That compares to Yelp (NYSE:YELP) at over $6B and OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) at a mere $1.7B. YELP and OPEN came public at different times, though. YELP is a recent IPO and has basically gone up 4x in the last year. OPEN had a similar performance back in 2010, but gave most of the big gains up in 2011. Since then, OPEN has slowly but steadily built its value back to where it was in late 2010.Zillow has attracted the attention of some vocal short sellers like Citron after its big run during the last year or so. Our own model supports the fact that revenue productivity at Zillow has gone down a great deal recently. In other words, it is spending much more money to grow, which is at odds with accelerating growth and expanding margins. Supporters have responded that a big chunk of the increased expenses are one-time in nature and obscure what is (or soon will be) tremendous operating leverage. Our numbers here simply show the change in revenue divided by the prior quarter change in spending, going from the most recent quarter back. So in the last quarter, the company spent twice as much incrementally as it gained in revenue. That's not a good trend.After soaring from $25 to $100 by September 2013, the shares have been consolidating between $75 and $90.This Wednesday, February 12th, Zillow will report Q4 2013 results and set the stage for 2014, possibly giving guidance that will impact current estimates. Investors will be looking at the headline results, growth in premium agent signups and further development of the ""marketplace"" that Zillow offers to online consumers. Nobody expects Zillow to miss consensus estimates or lower the guidance bar when it reports, but given its valuation, there will be some intense scrutiny on the ""quality"" of the results.We'd expect Zillow to report Q4 revenues of $60M versus the $56M consensus and show some earnings upside due to better expense control. Whether that will be enough to please the overall market is hard to say. In terms of guidance, management has been consistent in saying that they are ""continuing to invest"" in building the footprint rather than maximize margins, so that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone when they talk about 2014.The current market environment leans toward a ""risk-on"" stance, particularly when there is a large potential market opportunity that demands heavy investment now but promises recurring and profitable levels down the road.Beyond the QuarterThe bigger question for real investors in Zillow is the durability of its client base after the ""investment mode"" is over and it shifts into margin expansion. As the online real estate market has developed, it's become clear that Zillow is a great lead generator for the ""buyer agent"" who tends to help people find a home versus a ""listing agent"" who relies on having properties that other brokers will show and ultimately sell. Both sides of the equation effect a sale and both make a commission.A key part of the growth story for Zillow is the ""premium agent"" that pays for leads using the platforms. Many agents don't like to admit the fact that the quality and size of the Zillow traffic means they almost need to be there if they don't have a well-established network of buyers and sellers already. So these premium agent subscriptions have been growing. In fact, this growth has accelerated during the last year from single digits QoQ to 15% QoQ growth for the quarter ended September 2013. If this number holds or increases, the stock is likely to work higher.Real estate agents have so far been quite resistant to disintermediation and have protected their rather high fees with an effective tenacity. In the medium term, Zillow and similar services like Trulia (TRLA) are in a position to help them, at least with lead generation and getting listings more exposure. But at the same time, it will create the platform that might finally offer an effective way to buy and sell real estate without agents involved.Finally, ""marketplace revenue"" has been expanding at a rapid rate. This is where Zillow users can shop for home-related products and services, including mortgages, insurance and remodeling.We've built an IV model for Zillow that incorporates what is probably the best-case scenario for the company. For example are long-term revenue estimate of $600M for 2017 versus the current consensus of $481M. Using a 40x multiple, we get to an IV of $81 for 2014, which tells us the shares are fully valued based on what we know now.Stock ConclusionWe have been skeptical of Zillow given its high spending rates to achieve growth, but its market position is looking more unassailable as consumers find its site preferable to alternatives. Like it or not, real estate professionals will be forced to ""go to where the buyers are looking"" and use Zillow for lead generation. The same will probably occur for related service providers as well.The high valuation makes it difficult to be aggressive at these prices, but it argues against being short this stock and does suggest a ""buy on dips"" approach as long as these strong fundamentals continue to hold up.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1876901,25120,2013-12-04T11:01:42-05:00,,"Investors in Trulia (TRLA) took another beating after analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock, fueling recent negative momentum even further.Over the past two months, shares have seen a roughly 40% pullback as investors took profits, also on the back of a third quarter earnings report which was not impressive. Yet I think it is too late to bet on a further short term correction as both the absolute and relative valuations seem fair.Goldman Turns CautiousAnalysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded their rating on Trulia from ""Buy"" to ""Hold,"" while cutting the price target by ten dollars. The new $41 price target still suggests some 20% upside from Friday's levels, and even greater potential given the sell-off on Monday in the wake of the downgrade.Analyst Heath Terry cites softer housing demand behind the downgrade. He continues to believe that Trulia should and will grow consumer and real estate agent adoption. Further growth should be mostly driven by mobile product investments.Yet Terry notes that the housing market environment is providing less tailwinds, and notices that the company might lose mobile consumers due to aggressive marketing by Zillow (NASDAQ:Z).The valuation at 22 times enterprise value in relation to expected EBITDA for next year creates a risk of deceleration of growth in the housing environment. Multiple expansion is limited unless Trulia can create significant leverage from the acquisition of Market Leader, and re-accelerated growth.ValuationTrulia ended its third quarter with $43.4 million in cash and equivalents. Total debt stands at $8.0 million, resulting in a net cash position of around $35 million.Revenues for the first nine months of the year came in at $94.0 million, up 97.8% on the year before. The company reported net earnings of $2.6 million, compared to a $9.3 million loss last year. Note that this year's earnings are entirely the result of a $16.8 million income tax benefit.Revenues for the year are seen around $143 million, as GAAP earnings are seen around break-even.Factoring in significant losses on Monday, with shares trading around $32 per share, the market values Trulia at $1.2 billion. Operating assets are valued just a tiny bit below that. This values operating assets of the firm at around 8 times annual revenues.Trulia does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveBack in September of last year shares of Trulia were sold to the general public at $17 per share. Shares immediately spiked up to levels in their mid-twenties to fall to lows of $15 in January of this year.Ever since, shares have seen significant momentum to levels in their low fifties by October of this year. From these levels shares have seen a 40% correction to current levels around $32 per share.Investment ThesisThe strong headline growth rates are driven by Trulia's acquisition of Market Leader earlier this year. In May of this year, Trulia bought Market Leader for $355 million, a significant amount for a firm reporting annual revenues of $45 million in 2012. Investors were happy with the deal as it added more scale and growth, giving Trulia ammunition to compete against Zillow. The price tag represents a discount on revenue multiples compared to Trulia's own valuation, although Market Leader's reported growth was slower.Partially as a result of the deal, reported revenues were up by 117% to $40.3 million over the past quarter. The deal added significantly to Trulia's operations. While Market Leader only has 6.2 million unique visitors per month, this compares to Trulia's traffic of 35.3 million unique visitors per month.Combined both firms now have some 56,000 subscribers, after adding a combined 5,900 accounts during the third quarter. Average selling prices per user increased to $186 and $155, respectively, for Trulia and Market Leader.Note that pro-forma revenues, including a full quarter contribution from Market Leader, came in at $48.1 million. The guidance of fourth quarter revenues of $48.5 to $50 million for the fourth quarter seems little ambitious given these pro-forma results, indicating very low growth on a sequential basis.Since the earnings report, shares have roughly lost another quarter of their value. The significant momentum which the stock has seen this year obviously creates greater volatility given the recent pullback. That being said, Trulia trades at a significant discount compared to Zillow on a comparable basis, reporting similar quarterly revenues, while the market attaches at $2.6 billion valuation to Zillow.On a comparative basis, shares are expensive although revenue multiples are coming down rapidly amidst strong revenue growth. The lack of earnings makes a traditional valuation analysis a bit difficult however.I reiterate my stance. I would be slightly more optimistic than the market is reflecting now. The absolute valuation multiples are high, but the valuation is justifiable given the key position in such a large market. Relative valuations remain in check as well, especially versus Zillow. I would be very cautious to jump on the momentum bandwagon to initiate a shot position.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1840022,22148,2013-11-14T12:31:12-05:00,,"After closing on the purchase of Market Leader back in August, did Trulia (TRLA) turn into the market leader in the online real estate sector? The company competes in the highly competitive online real estate marketplace for home buyers, sellers, renters and real estate agents against the likes of fellow online operator Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and legacy leader Move (NASDAQ:MOVE), which runs realtor.com. The fragmented market is ripe for a market-leading, go-to website for real estate transactions. The move by Trulia puts it in place to lead on the professional side, but it still lacks the consumer audience of Zillow.The marketplace for real estate transactions is rebounding solidly and provides plenty of opportunities for the replacement of legacy services that have shifted after the housing crisis. Lenders involved in the mortgage process have exited the business and demand for housing has moved from owning to renting. The market remains wide open for Trulia to grab though it must first overcome better known Zillow. Ultimately, the company that overcomes legacy issues of multiple listing systems (MLS) around the country, professionals tied to the print versions of advertising, and word of mouth connections with potential home buyers will become the dominant real estate marketplace.Housing Market RecoveryThe one part that Trulia can't control is whether the housing market recovers over the next five years as expected. The primary revenue generator for the industry that these stocks currently serve is the sales of existing homes. The number peaked at over 7 million transactions back in 2006 and is headed towards a rebound to 5 million this year. According to a Zillow presentation, analysts forecast existing homes sales volumes to jump to nearly 7 million in 2018. On top of that, home prices are expected to continue rising each year providing for higher sales prices. Higher sales prices equal higher commissions. Higher commissions equal sales agents with more money to spend on advertising.According to the National Association of Realtors, the September existing homes sales came in at a 5.29 million annual pace. The number was down 1.9% from the August pace, but it exceeded the year ago levels by 10.7%. The activity levels have now exceeded the prior year levels for 27 consecutive months now. Maybe as important, the median existing home price jumped 11.7% from the September of 2012. The combination of higher sales transactions and higher home prices equals much higher commissions for real estate agents.Q313 DetailsThe Q3 results were slightly confusing with the inclusion of Market Leader numbers into the earnings with both the contribution from acquisition date and full quarter pro forma numbers. Ultimately investors want to see the full quarter contribution on a pro forma basis. Based on those numbers, the highlights are below:The Market Leader segment only generated 22% growth, which isn't what investors in Trulia want to see. The company hasn't done a good enough job convincing investors that agents will automatically advertise on Trulia due to the connection with Market Leader software that powers their agent websites. If Zillow has more user traffic, the fear has to be that agents will move business to that online marketplace regardless of the connection.Based on updated analyst estimates, Trulia trades at 52x forward earnings estimates and 5.5x forward revenue. Zillow trades at higher multiples of 154x forward revenues and over 10x forward revenue estimates. Move trades at much lower multiples considering analysts only forecast 11% revenue growth next year. The valuation differences aren't surprising, as investors are willing to pay up for the leading consumer real estate platform.Consumer MetricsThe most important numbers continue to be the lower visitors to the Trulia properties and the average revenue per user (ARPU), both of which are lower than Zillow. While Trulia will tout the higher subscriber totals, the real keys are the consumers coming to the websites that will attract the real estate agents.The ultimate consumer metric of total average monthly unique users was 42 million for Trulia when including 6 million from Market Leader. The Trulia business only saw flat sequential growth, though 42% growth over last year. It was the slowest growth in nearly a year. The below slide highlights the visitors, both total and mobile along with the user contributions:Zillow swamped these audience metrics with August traffic of 63.7 million monthly unique users (MUUs), an increase of 75% year-over-year. For the quarter, MUUs were 61.1 million, up 69% year-over-year. Not only does Zillow have a substantial lead, but it is also seeing higher growth rates. Zillow went as far to say that comScore reported its desktop market share gained from nearly 27% last year to 34% during Q3. Move saw solid user growth of 22%, but it remains a distant third place. At only 28 million MUUs, it continues to fall further behind market leader Zillow.Average Revenue Per UserA key metric for any business is always finding out ways to get existing users to spend more money. Naturally all business want new users, but the business already has the attention of existing users and having them spend more can be an easier way to grow revenue and more importantly the bottom line.In this area, Trulia is starting to max out with geographic expansion and lower ARPU from Market Leader. The company continued to forecast a goal of reaching $450 per user each month. The goal will be even more impressive if it can also reach the target of 225,000 subscribers. With the current subscriber base of only 56,000 following the substantial increase of 25,000 new subscribers from Market Leader, it sits far from the ultimate goal. At the same time, it is only achieving ARPU of $186, with that figure falling $8 sequentially. The Market Leader segment is even lower at $155. While Zillow only has 45,000 subscribers, it does obtain a higher $264 a month per agent. Depending how an investor views the Market Leader subscribers at the lower rates, Zillow still appears to have more important subscribers and clearly the larger spenders. Below are the quarterly ARPU stats for Trulia:Stock ChartThe below yearly chart for Trulia shows a chart in a general uptrend facing some downside risks. The nearly 10% jump on November 13 from rumors of a buyout offer helped provide a large bounce off the 200 ema.ConclusionWhile Trulia has taken a big step to being a market leader in the professional side of the real estate business, it has moved even further away from attracting consumers. The online real estate marketplace is one where consumers are increasingly driving the equation and Zillow continues to pull away from the pack. The business should continue shifting towards a model where the market leader commands 80% of the market leaving 20% for the remaining players. In that manner, the stocks are already aligning towards a higher value for the real market leader. Unfortunately, this divide will widen if consumers continue to flock to all of the marketplace offerings of Zillow.Ultimately, the number two player in any industry won't be able to maintain premium valuations while the leader will continue showing substantial growth and higher profits. The lower valuation of Trulia at 5.5x forward sales isn't a bargain while Zillow at roughly 10x forward sales could be the better investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2026351,61671,2014-02-18T14:30:00-05:00,,"On the face of it, 2013 was a great year for online real estate company, Zillow (NASDAQ:Z). It saw stratospheric growth in users, Premier Agent subscribers and revenue and managed to broaden its lead over competitors Trulia (TRLA) and Move (NASDAQ:MOVE).However, looking beneath the surface, escalating costs and a more aggressive marketing strategy from Trulia point to Zillow continuing to be a compelling short in 2014.2013 in reviewZillow ended 2013 with impressive revenue growth and gains in both unique users and Premier Agent subscribers. Revenue grew 69.1% year-over-year to $197.5 million. It reported a record 70 million unique users in January, an increase of 24 million year-over-year. Premier Agent growth was 64%, and it exited 2013 with 48,314 subscribers.The above growth rates are certainly impressive, but further examination reveals some worrying trends that may give investors cause for concern.Revenue growth slowingAfter an impressive run, revenue growth for Zillow is now starting to slow. You can see from the graph below that revenue growth peaked in 2011 at a staggering 116.8%, which has since tapered off to 69.1% in 2013. Revenue growth for 2014 implied by the midpoint of management guidance ($291 mil) is 47.3%.Source - ZillowOn the face of it, 47.3% top line growth is certainly nothing to sneeze at - but moving further down the income statement, things look less encouraging.Operating leverage? What operating leverage?It's fairly evident from Zillow's financials that top line growth has yet to translate into improved bottom line profitability. The graph below shows operating costs as a percentage of revenue for the last 5 years.Source - ZillowWhat really stands out is the significant ramp-up of sales and marketing expense beginning in 2012 and accelerating in 2013. Sales and marketing reached a staggering 55.1% of revenue in 2013, as a result of Zillow's national advertising campaign (at a cost of approximately $40 million) and Zillow's continued need to invest heavily in sales and marketing to generate incremental Premier Agent subscribers revenue.Growth in sales and marketing is outpacing user and subscriber growthThe graph below illustrates how growth in both unique users and Premier Agent subscribers has decelerated in the last two years, while there has been a significant ramp-up in sales and marketing expense growth. Despite sales and market expense increasing by 121% in 2013 over 2012, Premier Agent subscribers and unique users increased by a much more modest 63.9% and 57.4%, respectively.Source - ZillowOne can be forgiven for wondering whether Zillow's mammoth sales and marketing efforts are beginning to be subject to diminishing marginal returns.Advertising expense to ramp significantly in 2014Based on Zillow's guidance for 2014, we shouldn't expect the parabolic rise in advertising expenses to slow down any time soon. In addition to the roughly $40 million Zillow spent on advertising in 2013, it is forecasting advertising spend to increase to $65 million in 2014. If we take the midpoint of its revenue guidance, this would be an increase from approximately 20% of revenue in 2013 to 22% in 2014.The competition isn't standing still either, with Trulia announcing during its recent Q4 conference call that it too is jumping on the national ad campaign bandwagon and is intending to spend $45 million on advertising in 2014. The obvious question is how the simultaneous escalation of advertising expenditure by Zillow and one of its major competitors will impact both firms' ROI, given they are competing for the same consumers and a finite real estate advertising spend.Zillow's EBITDA target - further away than everThe end result of this bloodthirsty battle for mind share is that Zillow continues to move further away from management's ""near-term"" target financial model, as articulated by Zillow's CFO, Chad Cohen back in March 2013 at the Investor and Analyst Day.You can find the presentation here, with the relevant slide on page 3.During the presentation, Chad explained that ""in the near-term"", management is ""committed"" to ramping (non-GAAP, adjusted) EBITDA margin towards 30-35% when it reaches $200-$250 million in revenue. In fact, he goes further and suggests the company can achieve EBITDA margins of 40-45% as it approaches $500 mil in revenue ""given the relatively fixed nature of the investments we're making"".The company was just shy of the $200-$250 million revenue milestone in 2013, but should comfortably exceed it in FY2014 if the company meets management guidance. But rather than progressing towards its stated goal, the company is consistently moving in the opposite direction.After achieving an EBITDA margin of 22% in 2012, EBITDA margin declined to 15.1% in 2013. Based on the midpoint of guidance for 2014, EBITDA margin will likely decline further in 2014 towards the mid-13% range. Not great - but things look even worse on a GAAP-basis.Zillow likely to report even larger GAAP net loss for 2014Zillow did not provide GAAP net income or EPS guidance for 2014, instead providing non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA guidance of $38-$40 million. Discussing the (arguably dubious) practice of technology companies' attempts to get investors to focus on such non-GAAP measures goes beyond the scope of this article (For those interested, I'd recommend the recent article by Professor Aswath Damodaran of Stern University on the subject). And certainly, Zillow is not alone in that respect. But it is important to make the point that Zillow's non-GAAP, adjusted EBITDA measure excludes two major expenses which are deducted to arrive at GAAP net income - stock compensation and depreciation and amortization.Stock compensation may be a non-cash expense; but it is certainly still a real expense from the perspective of shareholders, given the resulting dilution of exercised stock options reduces earnings accrued to existing shareholders in future periods. And Zillow's stock compensation expense has grown exponentially in recent years - both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue.Likewise, depreciation and amortization has increased in recent years, and management's guidance for 2014 implies it will climb significantly higher this year. It is worth noting that Zillow capitalizes a significant portion of its web development expenses, which means these costs are not captured at all in its adjusted EBITDA metric. Ignoring depreciation and amortization effectively ignores much of the significant investments in technology Zillow is having to make to generate its impressive top line growth.The increases in both expenses as a percentage of revenue over the last 3 years is shown below, including the implied increase in 2014 based on the mid-point of management's guidance.Source - ZillowThe net effect of these costs increasing as a percentage of revenue is a growing divergence between Zillow's reported adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net income, as shown below.Source - ZillowEven as adjusted EBITDA has risen, GAAP net income has declined due to ballooning stock compensation and depreciation expenses.Management's guidance for 2014 implies this trend is set to continue. Adding back depreciation and amortization and stock compensation to EBITDA implies a GAAP net loss of around $29.5 million at the midpoint - more than double the net loss of $12.5 million in 2013.Conclusion2014 will likely be a critical year for Zillow. With such a lofty valuation, expectations are high and it is apparent that Zillow is having to spend aggressively on sales and marketing to try and meet those expectations. The result has been widening GAAP net income losses, which is set to continue this year if management's guidance is taken at face value. Trulia is facing similar challenges and is set to respond in kind, bringing into question just how effective the massive ramp-up in advertising spend will be for both companies.At some point, Zillow will need to demonstrate that the business can continue to grow strongly AND dramatically improve operating margins. Whether that is achievable remains to be seen.Disclosure: I am short Z. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1741492,20568,2013-10-11T15:49:42-04:00,,"Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) was the Bull of the Day on May 10, 2013, and over the last 5 months the stock saw price appreciation of nearly 40%. The stock is once again a Zacks Rank No. 1 (Strong Buy), and it is the Bull of the Day.Since the Last Bull of the DayI already noted that the last time I highlighted this stock was May 10, but that was three days after the company reported 1Q13 earnings. The stock fell about 7% following the release, which provided an excellent buying opportunity for investors.Over the past five months, the company had another earnings report, which was released on August 6. This was a solid beat, with revenue coming in 5.6% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and earnings that really surprised. In posting a loss of thirty cents for the quarter, Zillow delivered a 23% positive earnings surprise, beating the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate by nine cents.The most recent quarter saw a significant increase in unique users. More than 54M uniques for 2Q13 represented growth of 16% ahead of the most recent quarter and 62% more than the same quarter in the previous year.

The company has also expanded into the rental industry.Z Beats Estimates In Four of Last Five QuartersDating back to the June 2012 quarter, Zillow has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four of the last five quarters. The June 2012 quarter saw the company post earnings of $0.04, $0.05 ahead of the Zacks Consensus estimate for a 500% positive earnings surprise. The following quarter saw a six cent beat which translated into a 600% positive earnings surprise.The lone miss was the March 2013 quarter, as the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Australian InvestorsBillionaire investor James Packer became the latest Australian to acquire a massive amount of Zillow shares. In early September it was revealed that Cavalan Holdings, an entity controlled by Packer, bought roughly 3 million shares on the open market. That gave the investor a 9.4% stake in the company making him the second largest holder of Zillow stock.This investment follows another investor from the ""Land Down Under,"" which happens to be the largest shareholder. Caledonia Private Investments holds more than 5.1 million shares.Acquisition of StreetEasyOn August 19, 2013, Zillow announced the acquisition of StreetEasy the leading real estate website in New York City for $50 million in cash. As the one of the most popular real estate sites in the world's most dynamic real estate market, Zillow cemented its leadership position in the space.Since that acquisition, StreetEasy has maintained its leadership in the New York City area and has moved to consolidate its own operations and focus solely on NYC.It goes without saying that StreetEasy is a very valuable property and the company likely held an auction to sell itself. Its decision to go with the market leader is one that should not be lost investors. ValuationThe valuation picture for Z has moved higher since the last time I wrote about this company as the Bull of the Day. One has to imagine the earnings beat and general growth in revenues have helped push many valuation metrics higher. Those higher metrics have also pushed the stock price higher over the last five months. When I look at PE, I see a negative expected earnings number, so a comparison is not that easy. Instead of PE, Look at the revenue and earnings growth that is expected for Zillow vs. the industry average. The company is expected to post 42% revenue growth in 2014 vs an industry average of 7.3%. Analysts are expecting Zillow to produce 99.8% in earnings growth for 2014 compared to 13.9% earnings growth as an industry average. Clearly, Zillow is growing much faster than the industry average.The ChartI opted for a 6 months chart of Zillow for a reason. The Bull of the Day on May 10 came after what I thought was an unjustified sell off in the stock. I urged investors to take a hard look at the company and its growth and think about an investment in the stock. Needless to say you would have had market crushing gains had you purchased Zillow at that time. More recently, we see the stock reaching just over $100 at the start of September and has since retraced back to around $80. This is a very similar instance as the first Bull of the Day article in that I write it after a pullback and expect the stock and company to continue to outperform."
1711782,54272,2013-09-24T19:39:39-04:00,,"Zillow's (NASDAQ:Z) stock has taking a beating post Citron's recent research report. In my previous article, I discussed how Citron failed to adjust for one-time items in Sales and Marketing expenses and selectively represented key facts. In this article, I am discussing Citron's other points as well and why they don't make sense.Before starting, I will recommend readers to go through my previous article. Here's a summary:a). Citron hasn't accounted for one time expenses ($7.1 million) in Sales & Marketingb). Citron hasn't taken into consideration $8.4 million increase in television advertising spend which is going into brand building (longer payback time)c). Sans these items, 43% yoy increase in the company's sales and marketing expense lead to 69% yoy increase in revenues showing operating leverage in the model.The following is a brief reply to other quantitative and qualitative arguement in Citron's reportZillow's revenue comes from agents paying for leads rather than advertisingZillow is following cost per action/cost per lead model rather than doing display or CPC advertisement. Cost per lead is a better proposition for the company's core customers => realtors.Lacks of operating leverage because it uses television commercials and a direct salesforceNo doubt, LinkedIn (LNKD) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have a huge advantage as they don't have to spend on advertising to attract visitors. But whenever sales to SME customers is involved, the companies need to have a direct sales force. LinkedIn doesn't have to spend on advertising to gain visitor but it still spends 33% of its revenues on Sales and Marketing to gain advertisers (recruiters). Does it mean that LinkedIn doesn't have operating leverage in its business model. Not really - even according to Citron Research.Once television advertising stabilizes at current levels, Zillow is bound to see similar operating leverage by 2QFY14.Zillow doesn't own its contentThis is same as saying Facebook and LinkedIn doesn't own their content. Zillow is a platform which commands value because of its user base, while content is a commodity freely available across the internetSell side EPS estimates have come down.There is a good reason for it -- increase in television advertising spend. What Citron forgot to mention is increase in revenue estimates since the beginning of this year. The following is a list of revenue estimates from various sell side analyst around the beginning of this year.Sell Side estimates at the beginning of this yearCurrent consensus estimates are $190 million for FY13 and $269 million for FY14. Also, Zillow is a growth company and in all likelihood buy-siders were skeptical of sell sides estimates at the beginning of this year. The company has not only met expectations but also exceeded it. Compare this with % increase in LinkedIn's topline estimates for FY2013 and FY2014 since the beginning of this year. You will get the answer why Zillow has outperformed LinkedIn (up 110% Year to Date).Mindshare among homebuyers is not monetizable because real estate brokers (and not the home buyers) are Zillow's primary customers.Zillow's mindshare among home buyers => better and more comprehensive list of leads => more value to realtors who buy leads from ZillowIf a realtor decides to use only one lead generation service, it is likely to be the one which is market leader in the space.To sum up, most of the allegations which Citron has presented are based on selected data points and do not show the complete picture. If you want to play it as a valuation short, its your will. But the best days for Zillow from fundamental perspective are still ahead of us.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: GS Analytics is a financial research firm providing customized research services to US hedge funds.

1687142,20411,2013-09-11T10:45:12-04:00,,"By Neal RauZillow Inc. (Z) attracts more than 61 million unique visitors every month in the U.S., as many buyers and sellers now start their real estate ventures on the Web. Zillow's stock has climbed over 240% since the beginning of 2013. Zillow's shares fell over 7% after the company announced a secondary offering on August 19, but managed to reach new record highs of $103 just a few weeks later. Now, Zillow is trading about 6% off those record highs, so is the stock a buy, sell or hold from here?Many investors sold on the news of the additional shares being added by the secondary. However, the following day Australian billionaire James Packer, saw the dip as a buying opportunity, and acquired a 9.4% stake in the company, becoming the second-biggest shareholder in the U.S. real-estate website. Packer must see Zillow maintaining its lead over rival Trulia Inc. (TRLA) and be confident that the U.S. housing market will remain strong.Zillow's secondary offering was for 5 million shares, which represented a dilution of approximately 6-7%. The secondary included 2.5 million shares offered by Zillow, and 2.5 million shares offered by some existing shareholders, including co-founders Richard Barton and Lloyd Frink, and CEO Spencer Rascoff. The company said it intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions or investments in technology and businesses that complement its existing operations. Zillow creates revenue by selling individual subscriptions to mortgage brokers, real estate agents, and brand advertisers.The company is no stranger to making acquisitions.Zillow acquired HotPads.com, a map-based rental housing and real estate search engine, for $16 million in cash in 2012. Zillow was looking to expand in urban markets like New York City, so the acquisition of StreetEasy was the company's latest target. StreetEasy has about 1.2 million monthly unique users, primarily residential real estate shoppers in the New York region. StreetEasy can help Zillow rapidly expand its presence in the largest U.S. market, and use its sales team to increase advertising and subscription revenue, as the company hopes to keep its lead over rival Trulia.Zillow is trading over 100 times next year's earnings, while its closest competitor Trulia, trades at a multiple of about 54. Not everyone is bullish on Zillow's shares, as short interest represents 21.6% of the stock's total available float. We have Zillow rated strong long-term, and our live trading reports shows the stock close to a test of long-term resistance.Zillow needs to continue to do everything it can to strengthen its network to stay ahead of Trulia. The Company has been willing to sacrifice profits in an attempt to capture more subscriptions from real estate agents and mortgage-loan brokers. In 2012, the company made $50 million more in revenue than its rival Trulia. Recent acquisitions could lead to even more traffic, which could interest more real estate agents, and create an even more solid revenue stream for the company.Zillow shares briefly broke above long-term resistance, but failed to hold above converted support, and are now trading back below resistance. According to Stock Traders Daily, so long as Zillow is under long-term resistance, it is a sell/short for a durational trade. This is not a recent news play, but news does not make us money, stock prices do. According to the analysis we have conducted, the stock is at resistance, and for those that reason that news is good, news is also probably why the stock is at resistance in the first place. If resistance holds it is a sell, maybe even a short.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: By Neal Rau for Stock Traders Daily and neither receives compensation from the public companies mentioned herein for writing this article."
1656602,26861,2013-08-26T09:14:08-04:00,,"There is no question that stock prices for both Trulia, Inc. (TRLA) and Zillow, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) have been on a tear this year. The Yahoo! Finance figure below provides each company's year-to-date, or YTD performance. As of the August 23, 2013 market close, both companies have returned over 150 percent YTD.From an investor standpoint questions abound for these companies including how valuable is a web or mobile marketplace for real estate professionals over the long-term? What are key risks to consider for these types of companies? What are the impacts during a rising interest rate environment? How do these leading web and mobile real estate marketplace companies compare to one another and who is gaining market share?There are probably many other questions that could be asked, but for the time being, our goal is to attempt to determine whether or not Trulia has positioned itself well enough to be the future market leader for this industry. In order to meet this challenge, the remainder of this article will consider the real estate industry, specifically related to web and mobile trends; a breakdown of Trulia's business model; and a peer overview considering financial analysis, in order to form a conclusion.Real Estate Industry OverviewTrulia estimates that residential real estate as an industry accounts for more than a trillion dollars in annual spending in the U.S. This is validated according to data published in May 2012 by the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Association of REALTORS©, or NAR. These entities disclosed that sales of existing and new homes in the U.S. in 2011 had an aggregate transaction value of approximately $994 billion.In the past, consumers have lacked readily available access to detailed and comprehensive information to make housing-related decisions. Consumers instead have relied upon multiple sources of information such as real estate professionals, local newspapers, and word of mouth.The Web and Mobile TransitionAs the Internet becomes more entrenched with peoples' daily activity, the opportunity for transitions and shifts to occur in new industries and businesses greatly increase. This has clearly been the case with the transition of the real estate industry in web and mobile environments. With recent developments for online information, consumers now have the ability to access data and real estate professionals now have better tools to work with active potential buyers and renters.In addition to the U.S. Census Bureau and NAR, both Trulia and Zillow rely upon estimates from Borrell Associates, a research and consulting firm that tracks local advertising and helps media companies develop executive strategies. Key highlights from these entities relating to web and mobile market opportunities include:The real estate market's online potential is not only subject to advertising and marketing for existing and new homes. Other areas where Trulia and peers are gaining traction include rentals, home financing, home improvement, peer advice, and display advertising. Key relationships from these areas to the web and mobile real estate marketplace include:SummaryThe real estate market comprising these above-mentioned components is highly fragmented, local, and complex. The rapid rate at which data has become accessible for consumers via mobile devices and research platforms has created more transparency and efficiency. Many individuals are quick to criticize the data and information as inaccurate or incomplete. To some extent this is true, but holistically, consumers have more tools and resources at their fingertips than ever before. On the professional side, this has translated into web-based subscription models further accelerating industry trends towards higher demand for web and mobile products and services.There are very recent examples where existing web-based companies do not necessarily capture the full potential of their market and competitors emerge rather quickly expanding upon a prior precedent. LinkedIn Corporation (LNKD) and Monster Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE:MWW) serves as a great example of this occurrence, with LinkedIn expanding a job listing board web business into a global social network of over 200 million professionals.The current web-based shift for the real estate market is in a transitional stage, which is still in early development. Web precedents for real estate have included searchable listing information however Trulia is expanding this to create a marketplace with greater potential. For this reason, it is imperative for investors to delve deeper into existing public companies who operate in this space. Considering Trulia's business model and financial valuation will be of importance for identifying possible long-term investment opportunities.Trulia's BusinessAccording to the company's December 2012 10-K filing, Trulia considers itself to be a web and mobile marketplace yielding tools to research homes and neighborhoods which enable real estate professionals to market their listings and attract new clients. The company offers free and subscription products that provide real estate professionals with access to transaction-ready consumers and help these professionals enhance their online presence.Trulia considers its marketplace to represent a strong amount of potential buyers which provides opportunistic value for both seller and buyer representing agents, as well as mortgage brokers and lenders, and property rental managers. As validation of Trulia's transaction-ready consumers, Trulia survey data conducted between January and December 2012 indicated that over 76 percent of over 543,000 respondents contacting real estate professionals through the Trulia marketplace suggested that they were planning to move in the next six months; almost half of over 382,000 respondents stated that they were pre-approved for a mortgage.The company also provides display advertising services for companies who wish to market and advertise to either real estate-related consumers or professionals. Like Homeaway, Inc. (NYSEARCA:AWAY), Expedia, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), Orbitz Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE:OWW) and other subscription-based or revenue-booking companies, Trulia's advertising segment is secondary to its core subscription-based revenue driver.Trulia claims to have a continually refreshed searchable database with more than 112 million properties, including 4.1 million homes for sale and rent. As of the 2013 second quarter earnings transcript, the company had approximately 400,000 agents that were active on their site.Trulia also supplements listings data with local information on schools, crime, and neighborhood amenities providing insights into each community. During the second quarter earnings announcement, management stated that in addition to local neighborhood crime, school, commuter, and property value data insights Trulia's interactive maps now visualize historical earthquake and flood data to depict the risk of these natural disasters on a block by block level. It is also management's opinion that interactive maps serve as an important part of the mobile experience as they deliver insights of what is happening right where the consumer is considering properties. These improvements have translated to higher mobile demand with mobile monthly unique visitors now representing over 13 million, a year-over-year, or YOY increase of 100 percent. Growth DriversTrulia has established its primary goal as building the leading online real estate marketplace. The company has identified core strategies to achieve this goal which include:Based on the 2013 second quarter earnings report, Trulia has made progress on all fronts for these strategies. The company has developed a growing presence with its mobile products by offering 15 mobile applications across platforms, including dedicated apps for renters, mortgage seekers, and agents. This has translated into peak periods on the weekends generating a majority of the company's traffic from mobile devices. Trulia has expanded their interactive map data as mentioned above, and integrations into Facebook, Inc. giving consumers recommendations on real estate professionals from people in their social network.One of Trulia's key consumer metrics is new contributions of user-generated content. During the second quarter for 2013, Trulia users made 1.1 million new contributions to the site, a 44 percent increase over the second quarter of 2012. The company finished the quarter with a cumulative total of over nine million user generated contributions in their database, up from approximately six million a year earlier. It is important for investors to pay close attention to Trulia's growth with user-generated content. This business model has single handedly propelled TripAdvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) to a company with an enterprise value of over $10 billion. Yelp, Inc. (NYSE:YELP) and Open Table, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN) are two other examples of companies with user-generated content. Even Expedia and Priceline.com, Inc. (PCLN) are taking note and more aggressively expanding their user-generated content.The company has had success in both growing its number of premium subscription real estate professionals and corresponding increased revenues. There is an estimated base of more than 2.8 million real estate professionals in the U.S. Premium subscription real estate professionals grew 49 percent YOY to just fewer than 35,000; while quarterly revenues grew roughly 77 percent, of which marketplace revenue grew 90 percent and media revenue grew 52 percent. Trulia's mobile subscription product is priced at a premium to the web subscription product. The mobile product launched in May of 2012 and has added strong value to revenue growth.In May of this year, the company announced plans to acquire Market Leader, Inc. (NASDAQ:LEDR) to accelerate growth and add valuable products and services. The section below will go into further details regarding the deal. The company also announced a strategic partnership with RE/MAX by expanding Trulia's offerings with RE/MAX, which has one of the most productive sales forces in the industry and a global reach of 90,000 associates in more than 90 countries. According to the 2013 REALTrends 500 survey, RE/MAX agents averaged a transaction size of 17.1 in 2012, compared with the survey average of 7.9. The expanded partnership provides RE/MAX agents with premium branded profiles, custom training curriculum, and valuable marketing and advertising products. These features support consumer reach and provide for the opportunity to win more listings and close more deals. Earlier this week, RE/MAX announced its plans to file for an initial public offering, or IPO.Data, Technology, Products, and CustomersDataThe data side of Trulia's business presents a significant challenge for the company's long-term success.The company relies upon feeds covering millions of new and existing for sale and for rent listings every day from Multiple Listing Service Listings, or MLSs, real estate brokerages, real estate agents, real estate listing aggregators, and other third parties. Detailed ownership and property data is obtained from vendors who collect and digitize information from public county records. Third party data is also collected for school information (district, type, parent reviews, and ratings) and crime (occurrence, type, location, and description of non-violent and violent crime). Neighborhood amenities (location, names, and ratings for nearby restaurants, grocery stores, banks, and gas stations) are provided on Trulia's maps based on data received from Yelp. Community information (median household and family income, age of homes, commute times) are analyzed from data from the U.S. Census Bureau. User-generated content includes questions and answers, blogs, real estate guides, topics including local information, tips on home buying and selling and observed market trends.TechnologyData is processed through Trulia's proprietary algorithms and heuristic data validation engine to sort, augment, and select the most up-to-date and accurate data to display. Search logic is applied to the data and the additional information on schools, crime, neighborhood amenities, home values, and other community information is overlaid to provide a comprehensive interactive map product. School information is color-coded with a low, medium, or high rating; crime heat maps also provide a color scale utilizing proprietary analysis; and home values utilize sales records and property information from Trulia databases. Trulia has an agreement with Google, Inc. (GOO) to use Google basic maps, which Trulia then integrates with their proprietary insights. The company has two patent applications pending in the U.S. and will be pursuing additional patent protection.In June 2012, Trulia entered into a Platform Services Agreement with a segment of Move, Inc. (NASDAQ:MOVE), Move Sales, Inc., or ListHub, which provides the company with a substantial portion of the unique listings in Trulia's marketplace. Under the terms of the agreement, ListHub grants nonexclusive license to display listings on Trulia's platform and to use these listings for the purpose of providing real estate professionals with information relating to lead generation management and advertising products. The agreement contains a 48-month term and renews automatically for additional one year terms unless canceled upon the provision of 90 days prior notice by either party. This agreement is not cancelable by ListHub except in the case of material uncured breach by Trulia or by the company filing for bankruptcy, insolvency or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if a receiver is appointed on Trulia's behalf.ProductsTrulia's products can be organized between products for consumers, real estate professionals, and advertisers. For consumers this entails a searchable database;the Trulia Estimate which is an estimate of an off-market property's value based on proprietary analysis of relevant home data such as recent sales of similar homes and property facts; rich insights and content via products such as Local Info (previously mentioned school, crime, amenity, etc. information), Advice (providing the ""inside scoop"" on homes, neighborhoods, and real estate professionals based on advice generated by the active community of contributors), Find a Pro (provides a directory of over 875,000 real estate professionals), Value Information (provides information and analytics on the property value), and Mortgage (guides on how to finance real estate-related purchases, mortgage rate trends, and calculators); and Mobile providing a variety of applications such as Real Estate App, Rental App, Agents App, and Mortgage App.For real estate professionals products include subscription and free products to promote themselves and their listings connecting with consumers searching for homes. Subscription products include Trulia Pro (lead generation, local lead rotation, featured listings, property pages, detailed contact information in search results, leads via mobile, and integrated recommendations with Facebook), Trulia Local Ads (purchase of local ads on Trulia's website by zip code or city and by share of given market), and Trulia Mobile Ads (purchase of local ads on mobile applications and mobile website by zip code and by share of given market). Subscribers to these services also have access to Trulia Insights (in-depth information about leads) and Trulia Instant Leads (connecting professionals with the consumer who sent the lead). Free products include property listings, mobile application, agent profiles, and recommendations, among others.Products for advertisers include the selling of display media advertising on a cost-per-impression, or CPM and cost-per-click, or CPC basis to national advertisers seeking to reach the audience for Trulia's online properties and those of publishing partners. Advertisements are displayed through graphical displays and text links, including robust targeting capabilities.CustomersReal estate professional customers paying for subscription products include agents, who collaborate with consumers, seek leads, and manage transactions; brokers, which recruit, train, and provide core real estate services to agents; and national real estate franchisors, which provide real estate services to franchisees to enable the growth of their brand. The majority of Trulia's real estate professional subscribers are agents. On the advertising side, for 2012, the ten largest advertising partners accounted for more than 63 percent of Trulia's media revenue. No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of total revenues.Company RisksTrulia like any business is exposed to risk. All investors should always consider the risk disclosures in the filed annual and quarterly financials, as not all are mentioned in this section. Many of Trulia's risks relate to the fact that the company has a limited operating history and as a result, there are no guarantees with respect to the sustainability of growth and profits. Competition is also a risk, as Trulia will continue to depend upon growing premium paying real estate professional subscribers as wells as growing the company's average monthly revenue per subscriber. Competitive factors also relate to demand for advertising spend. Competition will be discussed more in the peer review section below. Generally speaking, most of these risks are typical for all businesses.The remaining highlighted risks are significant and more specific to the core of Trulia's business. The first primary risk is that Trulia depends upon relationships with various third parties to operate their websites. These entities include real estate listing aggregators, multiple listing services, real estate brokers, apartment management companies, and other third parties. Many of the agreements with these providers are short-term agreements that may be terminated with limited or no notice. Disruption from one or more of these parties would lead to a significant impact on the quality of experience for users. This same risk goes for the local information provided by third parties for schools, crime, and neighborhood amenities.Trulia also states that the company currently depends on a single listing aggregator to provide a substantial portion of the unique listings in the company's database. The effort that would be required for Trulia to replicate this information would not be feasible to avoid an adverse effect on the company's business and operating results. Also, real estate brokers control the distribution and use of their listings and Trulia's business would suffer if brokers withheld these listings. In the past brokers have refused to syndicate their listings, and if this were to happen in the future, there could be adverse impacts to the company's business and operations.Trulia is also hyper sensitive to the real estate industry. Investors should understand that Trulia and Zillow have built their businesses recently. When another recession occurs, these companies will be impacted possibly greater than other industries. The company specifically states that all of its core revenue generators could negatively be impacted based on economic trends and changes to the regulation of the real estate industry and related areas.Another risk for the company relates to displaying accurate and complete information on a timely basis. The level of information which Trulia aggregates on its web and mobile properties is impossible to perfectly manage. The company states that it cannot independently verify the accuracy or completeness of all of the information provided to it by third parties. This is one of the areas where users have expressed criticism. When comparing local data aggregators in certain areas, it is clear that there are contradictions. This is most likely due to the fact that it takes larger data aggregators more time to update information versus smaller entities.The company is highly exposed to a narrow group of advertising partners generating the majority of its media revenues. If one or more of these large advertisers were to decrease or discontinue advertising with the company, business and operating results would be adversely affected. Additionally, Trulia has had collection issues from advertisers, as display advertisements are run prior to payment being received. This poses added material risk.Acquisition of Market Leader, Inc.As mentioned in the growth drivers section, Trulia announced its intent to acquire Market Leader, Inc. for $355 million, or an implied price of $11.33 per share based on Trulia's closing share price on May 7, 2013. The closing price for Market Leader as of August 20th, the company's final trading day, was $12.66/share. At the time of the acquisition announcement, Market Leader had more than 135,000 professional customers and 23,000 premium subscribers. During the second quarter, management stated that the combined companies will have approximately 50,000 premium subscribers, the largest in the industry.Market Leader has built deep general relationships with several national franchises including partnerships with Keller Williams, CENTURY 21, Better Homes & Gardens, and also with six of the country's 10 largest brokers, demonstrating software platform leadership in the market.Market Leader's software-as-a-service or SaaS includes customer relationship management, or CRM, tools, personalized websites, marketing tools, and content design for real estate professionals. The system is managed through the cloud and focuses on automating repetitive tasks so real estate professionals can focus on transacting their business and effectively marketing their services for future business opportunities.The CRM tools include proprietary real estate content and consumer email campaigns that real estate professionals use, and provide benefits for real-time insight into consumer online behavior. Products are offered for a recurring fee and include SaaS tools, advertising, and print services. Market Leader has four patents registered in the U.S., with one pending patent application.Management's statements during the recent earnings report on the acquisition included the following:""We believe Market Leader will complement the tremendous business we have built and into our scale, product set and customer reach. Agents and brokers will continue to leverage Trulia's innovative marketing solutions to engage with our transaction-ready audience, generate leads and gain exposure for themselves.""""We will complement this with Market Leader's comprehensive operating system, including CRM and lead engagement tools. Collectively, these will enable real estate professionals to increase their follow-up engagement and ROI on the leads they generate.""The acquisition seems like an interesting combination, however, there will be key items to consider once the deal closes in the third quarter of this year. Market Leader's revenue growth will impact Trulia as it is growing much slower. Analysts do expect growth to increase for Market Leader over the next two quarters, but it is not expected to be close to Trulia's near 70 percent growth expectations. Market Leader should possibly provide added improvement to adjusted EBITDA, but potentially put a drain on net losses and free cash flows. Trulia will also lose a significant amount of its current $215 million in cash, roughly $170 million or so once the transaction is complete.SummaryOverall, Trulia has been quite active during 2013. The company has continued to grow its business robustly through mobile growth, increased premium subscriptions and display revenue, the Market Leader acquisition, and the RE/MAX partnership. This growth is a testament to the proprietary developments of using third party data and information for the benefit of real estate consumers and professionals within web and mobile marketplaces. These events are all very positive for the company's business prospects, but more assessment is needed.Trulia does face significant risks with respect to the company's data and information structure, as well as real estate market risk and dependence on a minority of customers for display advertising revenue. It is worth noting that Trulia's reliance on ListHub is not atypical for real estate listing information publishers. ListHub provides services for Trulia, Zillow, Yahoo, Inc. (YHOO), AOL, Inc. (NYSE:AOL), among others. What is important to note is that Move through REALTOR.com© does compete against Trulia's marketplace, and with Trulia's acquisition of Market Leader, Move through ListHub now competes against Trulia as well.Real estate market risk is new territory for Trulia. Unlike Market Leader and Move, Trulia has not yet faced a significant market downturn while being a public company. As evidenced by the Yahoo! Finance figure below, both Market Leader and Move where severely impacted by the recession. Move has recovered as the market has rallied the past four years, but Market Leader has not despite the premium price allotted after Trulia's acquisition.Peer ReviewFor the peer review section both Zillow and Move (Realtor.com) will be compared against Trulia. Market Leader's information will be independently assessed in the tables below. The goal is to consider what, if any competitive advantages these two companies may have in consideration for Trulia's business. The fundamental analysis section will provide comparative metrics considering company growth, valuation, profitability, and cash flow. All information is as of the market close on August 23, 2013, with the exception being Market Leader as the acquisition closed in August and the stock's final price was reflected on August 20th. Nominal values are expressed in millions.ZillowZillow claims to operate the leading real estate and home-related information marketplaces on mobile and the Web, with a complementary portfolio of brands and products to help people find vital information about homes, and connect with the best local professionals. To put it simply, the company does many similar things as Trulia and Move.Our first topic to consider will be premium subscribers. Last quarter Trulia added 4,200 new premium subscribers while Zillow added roughly 4,800. Zillow's earnings transcript for the second quarter provides additional detailed information. In the first quarter of 2012, Trulia had more premium subscribers than Zillow. This is no longer the case as Trulia's premium subscribers now represent roughly 83 percent of Zillow's total. As the second quarter displayed, Zillow is maintaining its growth lead. Over the previous five quarters, Trulia has grown premium subscribers 10% per quarter while Zillow has grown premium subscribers 16%, or 60 percent greater.For monthly unique users both companies have averaged a quarterly growth rate near 11 percent during the previous five quarters. Trulia's monthly unique users represented 65 percent of Zillow's total in the first quarter of 2012; this number has slightly decreased to 64 percent to date. Both companies have experienced robust growth in mobile monthly unique users; Trulia's mobile numbers are approaching 40 percent of total monthly unique users, while Zillow's are at 60 percent.Zillow claims to have an inimitable database of homes. On paper, Zillow is on par with Trulia in that the company is required to undergo many of the same processes to build its data for its marketplace. This involves getting data from MLSs, real estate brokers, among others mentioned. Zillow is also utilizing ListHub via Move to get access to aggregated listing information. Zillow similarly relies upon proprietary technology to develop its data overlays for its interactive mapping; especially for its Zestimates and Dig Estimates. The company has four patents issued in the U.S. and one patent issued in Australia.When comparing website resources, Zillow does provide additional information above and beyond Trulia. This is indicative of Zillow's Zestimates and Digs Estimates as compared to Trulia's estimates. As mentioned regarding Trulia's growth in user-generated content, Zillow had roughly 20 million user-generated pieces of content at the end of 2012; this is over 100 percent more than Trulia's recent quarterly report total.When considering the last three and a half years of investment into each company's respective business, Zillow has invested nearly $100 million while Trulia has invested nearly $70 million into product development and capital budget expenditures. Additionally, Zillow has more aggressively marketed the Zillow properties through advertising and marketing spend. This has translated to stronger brand recognition for Zillow and is a major reason the company has been more successful in growing its premium subscribers and monthly unique users.On the revenue side, Trulia's marketplace revenue is roughly two-thirds of Zillow's marketplace revenue. Zillow breaks out both real estate and mortgage marketplace revenue, while Trulia currently does not. Zillow has a narrower lead when it comes to media revenue. By acquiring Market Leader, Trulia has expanded its revenue segments to include SaaS. Currently, Zillow does not have a significant competitive product for this segment.Zillow continues to maintain an acquisition strategy favoring real estate content-based companies providing real estate professionals with subscription-based products and services. The most recent acquisition, Streeteasy, provides these types of services on the east coast with an emphasis in the New York area. While Trulia's primary goal is to become the largest real estate marketplace, Zillow continues to grow its content side through acquisition more so, while Trulia has crossed over into the software side of the business. Zillow has made smaller acquisitions with respect to the software side, however, has not indicated their scale nor broken out any separate revenue segments.Move, Inc.Move similar to Zillow, claims to be the leading real estate information marketplace by connecting consumers with the information and the expertise they need to make informed home buying, selling, financing, and renting decisions. This is accomplished through REALTOR.com©, which is the official web site of the NAR, the largest trade association in the U.S. that represents residential and commercial real estate professionals, including brokers, agents, property managers, appraisers, counselors, and others engaged in all aspects of the real estate industry. The NAR had approximately one million members as of December 31, 2012.The NAR recently had a board meeting to discuss key items that will impact Move's ability to operate its business. Investors should consider reviewing Valuable Insights recent article on Move, as well as review the second quarter transcript. The two primary outcomes from the NAR board's decision to accept all the recommendations to modify the existing operating agreement include giving REALTOR.com more flexibility in identifying listings from sources beyond those provided by realtors for new homes and rental properties; and to provide better capabilities to enhance the REALTOR.com brand.Move's products and services can be broken up into two separate categories, Consumer Advertising and Software and Services. For consumer advertising similar services are provided as with Trulia including listing advertisements and non-listing advertisements. On the software and services side, Top Produce® and TigerLead® are SaaS products providing productivity and lead management tools tailored to real estate agents on a subscription basis. These are the primary products which compete with Trulia's Market Leader. Additionally, ListHub® syndicates for-sale listing information from MLSs or other reliable data sources, such as real estate brokerages, and distributes that content to an array of online web sites.I find it interesting that management from Move stated that the company has been successful in signing multiple MLSs including the San Francisco and Boston markets, and then stated that:"" To put this in context, our other competitors had very few MLS agreements, this means, a huge amount of data on our competitor sites are coming from multiple sources in which the data passes through many hands before it makes its way on to the site. These sites are very slow to add new listings and very slow to remove listings that are no longer on the market.""ListHub is the primary listing information aggregator providing data to both Trulia and Zillow, as well as over a hundred other real estate publishers. The ListHub website provides an overview of the services for its products to publishers here.As for data and technology, Move has a strong advantage based on the fact that their content is acquired and developed from relationships with more than 800 MLSs across the country, which represents nearly all MLSs, with approximately 90% of the listings updated every 15 minutes and the remaining listings updated daily. The company also has the advantage of experience as for nearly 20 years Move has provided consumers with access to a highly accurate and comprehensive set of real estate listing data and has built substantial relationships within the real estate industry. The company has developed proprietary technologies for its consumer advertising and software and services businesses. Move has eight patents issued in the U.S.When comparing Move's website and mobile applications with Trulia, Move definitely has work to do. The company has only recently developed a similar ""advice"" category and is in the process of developing apps for all of its services. Both Trulia and Zillow have an advantage with mobile monthly unique user growth, user-generated content, locational data such as crime and school information, Zestimates and Trulia Estimates, Digs Estimates, etc. These interactive mapping properties have generated stronger brand recognition and Move will need to play catch-up. Over Move's past 13 years, the company has considerably spent more money on product development and capital expenditures totaling near $570 million. More recently this has been close to $150 million over the past three and a half years compared with Trulia's near $70 million; or over twice as much as Trulia.When comparing monthly unique users, Move added approximately 1,760 versus Trulia's 4,200 during the second quarter. Move's monthly unique users represent roughly 82 percent of Trulia's total. Move does not break out premium subscribers, nor does the company disclose a premium subscription product.Comparatively on the revenue side Trulia's marketplace and media revenue is roughly two-thirds of Move's equivalent revenue segments. Trulia's Market Leader acquisition puts the company slightly ahead of Move's software and services revenue segment. With the acquisition of TigerLead, Move's software and services revenues grew 57 percent YOY and has served as the primary catalyst for growth within the company. Strong consideration should be given based on Move's experience and relationships throughout the real estate industry when thinking about Trulia's abilities to integrate Market Leader into its business.Fundamental AnalysisRevenue GrowthThere are a couple of interesting trends to observe from this information. First it is clear that Trulia and Zillow are growing significantly more so than Market Leader and Move. This is primarily being driven by real estate professional subscription products. However, both Market Leader and Move have witnessed significant increases in growth over the past three years which has translated to much more robust growth this year. This is indicative of a broad recovery for the macro environment, but also speaks to the transitional shifts for web and mobile solutions occurring in the real estate industry.When considering the Market Leader acquisition, Trulia would move fairly close to Zillow for 2013 revenue estimates. Based on growth trends, Zillow is estimated to be the largest of this group by revenues in 2014. Depending on how well Trulia performs post acquisition integration, the running for market share leader is and will be fairly close. If Trulia is able to create strong synergies between their existing operations and Market Leader's technology, they may be able to generate higher growth than simply considering the combined separate estimates above.ValuationFrom a valuation perspective this table provides some conflicted information. We can assume that Market Leader trades at a premium due to the fact that the company has been acquired. This is interesting based on the above valuation metrics as we consider Move, Trulia, and Zillow. If we think about the after-effects of the merger, Trulia's cash accounts will be significantly impacted resulting in a much higher price/cash metric, closer to 25. Intangible assets will also increase, but enterprise value/sales will be cut in half. When considering Zillow's comparative metrics, it is quite evident that Zillow trades at the highest premium of the three. Interestingly Move trades at a significant discount based on enterprise value to sales, but the company is fairly in line with most other metrics, more so versus Trulia than Zillow.From a value standpoint, Move does provide a more compelling option versus its peers. However, as Trulia and Zillow continue to aggressively compete for growth, their current stock prices may offer some appreciation potential. When comparing Zillow against Trulia, it is very clear that Zillow is trading at a significant premium. This is important, because Trulia's acquisition may pave the way for a more competitive stance with Zillow, based on revenue segments. Weaknesses in the market may offer a better investment option for Trulia.Earnings and Cash FlowThe only company which displays positive results for all categories is Move. However, Move's YTD and estimated P/E ratios do not paint a rosy picture even based on the company's accelerating growth trends. Over the past three years, Move's operating cash flow has grown an average of over 50% per year. Zillow has seen its earnings decline significantly during the first half of the year. This has negatively impacted the company's operating cash flow over the same period. Free cash flow has also significantly declined. Trulia's operating cash flow has displayed a two-year increase, albeit at a moderate pace; it is picking up more robustly in the first half of the year.Interpreting these trends suggests that both Trulia and Zillow are spending aggressively to grow revenues, especially in Zillow's case. Again, it will be important to see how successful the Market Leader acquisition will be for Trulia's bottom line and free cash flow. Operating cash flow will definitely increase. Additionally, it should be noted that while Trulia has a positive estimated P/E ratio, this is not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. The same can be said for Zillow's 2014 estimate.ConclusionThe table below provides a final breakdown of revenue, subscriber, and unique user information between the three companies. Market Leader's information is assumed within Trulia.By acquiring Market Leader, Trulia has created a more comprehensive suite of products for real estate professionals, more comparable to Move. This strategy does not come without risk. Zillow, which already has a lead on Trulia for the marketplace side of the business model now can push further into gaining more market share for premium subscription services for both real estate and mortgage markets. And Trulia now must contend with Move's strong momentum of software and services growth as its primary competitor for this segment.Both Trulia and Zillow are ahead of Move from a premium subscription model and have integrated significantly more variety when it comes to services and tools for professionals and interactive mapping for consumers within mobile and Web environments. Likewise Zillow has developed its presence on Web and mobile platforms at a significantly more rapid pace than Trulia. Both Trulia and Zillow were founded during the real estate bubble in 2005 and 2004 respectively, so Zillow has not had a much earlier start and management's execution has outperformed Trulia in this respect.In order of investment value, it would appear that Move provides the best value at the moment, while Trulia provides a discount relative to Zillow. In order of brand recognition, Zillow seems to be in the lead, while Trulia is not making significant progress, and Move is in an earlier development stage. Data and technology is difficult to gauge as Move has the most accurate information and extensive database, however, Zillow and Trulia have access to this database and a broader suite of interactive and professional information and tools for consumers and real estate professionals when comparing marketplace products. This is not to say that Trulia and/or Move cannot take market share from Zillow over time.There are many aspects to all three of these companies that could be discussed indefinitely. After digesting Trulia's business model and comparing the company against its peers, Trulia has positioned itself competitively within the real estate marketplace industry. This evolving industry is young and has plenty of room for further growth. Ultimately, the company which provides the best user experience may end up winning out. As evident from other business models such as TripAdvisor, user-generated content can be a significant catalyst. The online travel agency market has a variety of successful businesses, over time, the real estate marketplace may provide a confluence of successful businesses as well.Disclosure: I am long TRIP.

1706972,54272,2013-09-22T06:00:49-04:00,,"Last Friday, Citron Research released a bearish report on Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) leading to over 6% correction in the company's share price. I won't go into the full details of the report but the key metric Citron is questioning is extraordinary growth in sales & marketing expense in Q2 as compared to topline growth. Citron further goes on to say that unlike LinkedIn (LNKD), Zillow's sales and marketing expense is unpredictable and ""something else entirely"". (see below)Source: Citron Research's reportOn the face of it, i.e., if you don't dig deeper into the numbers, Citron's case makes sense. However, after looking at the company's filings it appears that Citron is selectively disclosing information to make Zillow look like more than just a valuation short.The company reported 2Q13 revenue of $46.92 million versus $27.76 million in 2Q12. Its sales and marketing expense in 2Q13 was $32.92 million versus $12.15 million in 2Q12. So, the company's revenue increased 69% while sales and marketing expense soared 178%.However, before jumping to conclusions let us first understand what caused this disproportionate increase in sales and marketing expenses for Zillow in 2Q13. Out of $32.92 million, $7.1 million was a one time expense related to the accelerated vesting of 218,071 unvested restricted stock units by a former employee.Source: Zillow's 2Q13 10QIn addition, another $8.4 million was primarily related to advertising spend which the company's management has clearly stated that they would double in their 1Q13 call. Unlike direct sales expense, advertising spend to create brand awareness may take sometime to play out and show in the topline numbers. Citron somehow tried to present that this $8.4 million is proportionally related to cost of acquisition of revenues in the second quarter. In reality this expense is related to the company's effort to acquire shoppers across online and offline channels which will help it in the long term.Sans these two items Zillow would have reported only 43% increase in its sales and marketing expense against 69% increase in topline showing the operating leverage in the model. As per management guidance, advertisement expenses which began ramping up in second quarter of this year are unlikely to see any significant sequential increase from here for the rest of this fiscal year. And although management has not explicitly commented, I don't see any significant increase in advertisement spend going into FY14.According to Citron, the pivotal question every investor needs to ask is:And if its best days are still in front of it, patient investors could reap even more rewards.Given the fact that extraordinary items significantly affected Zillow's second quarter results and the company is likely to face easier sales and marketing comparisons staring in 2Q14, I believe the best days are still ahead of it in terms of business fundamentals. The stock is unlikely to crash until the broader SaaS and Web2.0 bubble finally bursts.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: GS Analytics is a financial research firm providing customized research services to US hedge funds.

1675962,52012,2013-09-05T14:08:27-04:00,,"In previous articles I've mentioned that I'm generally bearish on the market and as a result, I'm building a short portfolio. Two previous entries - Amazon.com (AMZN) and Tesla Motors (TSLA) - were added based on company-specific circumstances. Netflix (NFLX) was added for company specific reasons and because of general international ""headwinds."" Today's entry of Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) is a bit of departure from these, as the primary reason for its inclusion is sector related.As a preamble, let me say a word about why - in the midst of a raging bull market - I'm building a longer-term short portfolio.One of the questions I try to keep in mind when trading is: ""what edges can I, as an individual investor, have over the institutions that make up the majority of the market?"" Obviously it's not access to information. Instead, in my view, all the ""edges"" come down to not having to work within institutional constraints. First, of course, is the ability to focus on stocks that are off the beaten path and perhaps don't have the liquidity necessary for institutions to trade them. Certainly those types of situations figure in to my trading. But more germane to today's pick are three inter-related factors: not being subject to ""career"" risk, not needing to slavishly follow the trends of quarterly reports, and being willing to sell ahead of the crowd. Let me explain.By ""career"" risk I'm contrasting the individual's independence to that of Wall Street analysts who are measured mainly by reference to their peers. Thus, if an analyst strays too far from the pack and turns out to be wrong, he's crucified for it, while if he's wrong but so is everyone else, it's not really an issue. (Not to mention that it's difficult to be negative on Wall Street since - even today - brokerages want IPO and secondary offering business, which isn't typically given to firms that are apt to publish bearish stances.) Career risk is therefore one reason why there are so many calls that essentially follow the current trend.A second related point is that in building financial models, it's easiest and safest (again for career risk reasons) to take previous data and extrapolate from it. This works very well in non-cyclical sectors, and it even works during most of an up cycle or down cycle in cyclical markets. But as one gets to the latter stages of a cycle, it tends to cause massive overshoot, as risks appear to dwindle rather than increase. Or to put it another way, the longer a cycle goes, the less it looks cyclical and the more basis there seems to be to simply extrapolate the past few years forward. If analysts truly took cycles into account, multiples would contract the further into a bull market one got (and vice-versa for bear markets) but often it's the opposite - prolonged good periods breed complacency and result in multiple expansions.These factors, in my opinion, conspire to provide an opportunity for individual investors to take carefully sized short positions in an over-extended bull market.With that said, let me lay out the reasons for which I think we're in the later stages of a bull cycle in residential real-estate. The factors are listed in general order of importance, though I could be easily persuaded that some of the items mentioned later should be moved up the list.1. Insiders are SellingWhat initially drew my attention to the sector was the announcement that Re/Max plans to go public. Ostensibly it's just an estate planning move, but the timing of it is very suspicious in my view. Indeed, as the title of the linked article suggests, the founders are more than likely trying to sell shares to the public now because the market is hot AND earnings are at cyclical highs (""its best showing since 2007""). Moreover Re/Max isn't doing this in a vacuum, it has watched the results of others recently: Realogy (NYSE:RLGY) (owner of Century 21 and Coldwell Banker) went public on October 11, 2012; Trulia (TRLA) on September 20, 2012 and Z on July 20, 2011. As of the close on September 4th, their share prices are up 22%, 83% and 193%, respectively. Moreover, given the hot market, several of these companies have done follow-on offerings (e.g. TRLA, Z), and insiders are selling at an accelerating pace.The table below summarizes the insider sales of several representative companies in the sector as a function of year and as a percentage of insiders' current holdings (as given by Yahoo). The insider data comes from this site, but I had to clean up the Z data, as it contains extraneous sales from another company (NASDAQ:TTGT). (I did this by hand, so if anyone finds errors please alert me in the comments and I will fix them.) Furthermore the table includes only stock sales; I didn't include or make any adjustments for buys due to option exercises.Finally, since the RLGY 2013 data jumps out, we should note that 99.9% of those insider sales came from Apollo Management - they're not widely distributed among many sellers.Insider sales, particularly from newly established companies, are not unusual or alarming on their own. But when there's a general trend throughout the sector - including a rush to go public - I think it should set off a few warning bells.2. Home Prices have Bounced Back Substantially and Sales are StrongThe following charts depict trends in home prices and home sales. Median home prices are close to the peaks set during the bubble years of 2006-2007 and the Case-Schiller index as of June 30 shows prices at 2004 levels. Moreover, sales are robust once again. None of these indicate a top in the market per se, but they all suggest that we're well into a cycle - not near its beginning. (And if you believe, as I do, that the levels reached in 2006-2007 were totally unsustainable, then by that measure we're in peaking territory.)US Existing Home Median Sales Price data by YChartsUS Existing Home Sales data by YCharts3. Interest Rates are RisingOne of the major impetuses to the bull market in real estate has been the secular down trend in interest rates. Yet there are signs that the lows of this long trend may be in. The graph below is one indication, but there are other reasons to think rates may be on the way up, including a re-assessment by lenders of the risks of default (see e.g. the many municipal bankruptcies now unfolding, a process that 5 years ago would have seemed impossible to most observers).US 15 Year Mortgage Rate data by YChartsRising interest rates not only put a damper on home sales, median home prices and home affordability; they also serve to increase the discount rate used in discounted cash flow analyses - another negative for stock prices.4. Incomes Haven't Kept Pace with Home Price IncreasesThe increases in home prices seen in factor 2 do not seem to be driven by any fundamentals other than the Fed's low interest rate policy. Most notably, during the period from 2000 to today, real household income has fallen and unemployment is up. Thus affordability measures such as median home price/household income have increased substantially, making a continued run in the residential real estate market that much more unlikely. The point is even starker when looking at so called U6 unemployment.source5. Multiples are Expanding as Stocks Go HigherAs I mentioned at the outset, if stock prices reflected cycles, then there would a contraction in multiples as one got closer to cyclical peaks. But if all one does is extrapolate from recent data, then multiples expand as one progresses through the bull phase of an economic cycle. The figures below (P/S, P/CF, P/B) suggest that much of today's run in real estate stocks is due to multiple expansion, with multiples on some stocks reaching stratospheric levels (this is particularly true of the price to sales multiple). This is another bearish development.MOVE Price / Sales Ratio TTM data by YChartsMOVE Price to Cash Flow TTM data by YChartsMOVE Price / Book Value data by YCharts6. Roll-UpsIn the early stages on a new market such as Z and TRLA are developing, it's natural to see buyouts and roll-ups as the market rationalizes and consolidates. But there's also another reason that roll-ups can be attractive, viz. that valuations in the public market are so much higher than in private markets, that almost any deal makes sense - and at almost any price. The pace and frequency of recent acquisitions in the space suggest to me that the latter factor is operative to a significant extent, and in my experience this is often a sign of an impending top.7. Anecdotal AccountsFinally there's a wealth of anecdotal evidence suggesting a new frenzy in the real estate market. For example, here in Southern California we're back to having lotteries for new home sales. Furthermore, up until July there were many homes being sold on the first day of listing at $10,000 to $20,000 above the asking price - and not an insignificant number of these were bought sight unseen! Take that for what it's worth, but to me it suggests an unsustainable boom; one which will reverse sooner rather than later.Why Zillow?The seven factors above constitute the bulk of the reasons for which I'm bearish on the residential real estate sector going forward. The question then is, how to play it?My thought is to ease into a short position, choosing one company as a proxy and then adding more if and when market circumstances dictate. Looking at the valuations and insider sales shown above, I've chosen Zillow as being one of the more overheated stocks in the sector. Moreover, on September 4, it cleared the psychological $100 mark after receiving the good news of having a new significant holder: billionaire James Packer, who now owns 9.4% of the company. Typically I like to short after a news pop like today's, so choosing Z is also a trading decision. Finally, the idea that the company priced its latest offering at $82 just two weeks ago gives me more comfort shorting at $100. (For a more company-focused analysis outlining a short case against Z, see this recent SA article with which I generally agree.)Before concluding, however, we should also acknowledge the risks that are entailed by shorting Z because, if nothing else, these help establish a position size. Following are the best reasons I can muster to be bullish on the sector in general and Z in particular. First off, the total market cap of the real-estate information companies is quite small; looking 5 to 10 years down the road one could easily imagine it being 2-5X its current size. Other positives are the size and growth of Z's ""living"" database (where users upload their data), the growth and uptake of mobile users, and the recent integration of Zillow with Google Now. (I see this as a positive for Z, though I suppose one could turn it around and say that because Google recognizes the value, it would be more likely to re-enter the field as a competitor?) Finally, the demographic that Z reaches (home buyers and renters) is an attractive one to advertisers, such that monetizing page views may be easier than in many other industries.Portfolio PositionAs I've tried to argue, there are many compelling reasons to want some residential real estate exposure in a short portfolio, and given its lofty valuation and persistent insider selling, Z is a good choice to achieve that. Nonetheless, considering the offsetting potential positives, in this case I've kept my short position smaller than previous entries; allocating 2% of my portfolio short Z at a basis of ~$100. Doing so allows me to benefit (at least somewhat) if the market turns soon, and if not; having skin in the game gives me incentive to follow the sector even more closely to find other opportunities that may arise over the next several months.Disclosure: I am short Z, AMZN, TSLA, NFLX.

1644242,41821,2013-08-19T12:13:33-04:00,,"Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) is a website for potential homeowners, people looking to sell their homes, and real estate professionals. Zillow has provided astronomical gains to investors over the past 12 months, yielding 212.7% since the beginning of 2013 alone.From Zillow's website:Zillow is part of a host of companies that I've pointed out in a previous article that trade at a large P/E ratio based on heavy future speculation. However, Zillow has something unique going for it that other companies such as LinkedIn (LNKD) and Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI) do not: It's a real-estate-based stock with a heavy short position in the middle of a housing recovery. Zillow's forward P/E is about 160 at this level, compared to Yelp pushing 200 and LinkedIn at about 105.Click to enlarge image.It was reported this morning that Zillow is buying StreetEasy, a New York City oriented real estate company for $50 million. This is a perfect example of Zillow digging both feet in the dirt and solidifying their position in the recovering housing market.CNBC.com reported:Most of the short arguments on Zillow are based around its lofty valuation and price, but acquisitions are one way to make sure the company continues it's necessary extremely aggressive growth.A lot of analysts, including Seeking Alpha contributor Insightful Investing, are looking at Zillow as a great short proscpect -- similar to the way I looked at LinkedIn as a short. Most of these analyses are based solely on valuations of the company. But if there's one thing that companies like LinkedIn, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Yelp (NYSE:YELP) can teach us, it's that shorting based on valuation can sometimes lead to enormous losses. That's mainly due to the fact that general retail investors are more likely to invest on headlines and buyers panic, as opposed to valuation.However, Zillow has something else great going for it. Just the same way that macro pullbacks in the market can kill companies, sometimes companies can be catalyzed by the boom of an underlying sector as well. Hence, we find ourselves with Zillow in the middle of the beginning of a recovering housing market.Zillow's revenue comes from people who work in real estate and subscribe to the site. As the housing market recovers, this number is going to grow significantly. Aside from realtors, mortgage professionals, and advertisers are two other sources of revenue for the company. When people log on to the site search for real estate, it pairs them with real estate professionals and mortgage professionals who participate in the site and are in their area.I'm contending that Zillow's a buy not only due to the housing market acting as catalyst, but also due to the company's revenue growth (61% annualized over the last four years). If the company can continue this growth with consistency, it will meet expectations of investors and continue to trade in the same bullish fashion that it has.Risk lies in a couple of things, notably that the company is cash flow negative for the time being and that insiders are selling with regularity. Seeking Alpha contributor Jake Honeycutt points this out in his article ""7 Reasons Why Zillow is Overpriced"":But, just as there's risk, there's potential reward. Yahoo Finance has pointed out that 46% of the outstanding shares are held short. The manner in which this company is valued by its investors with such a significant short position makes it an ideal candidate for a short squeeze.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

I think because of this investors are valuing it based on what it will do in the next 3-5 years and not the short-term. As a result of Zillow's lofty valuation relative even to its fast growing internet peers, I feel this is a good short opportunity which I describe in more detail below.Recommendation: Short EquityInvestment Horizon: 6-12 monthsPrice Target: $70Strategy: Value; GARPCompany Description: Zillow is the leading real estate information marketplace. Company provides vital information about homes, real estate listings and mortgages through their website and mobile applications, enabling homeowners, buyers, sellers and renters to connect with real estate and mortgage professionals best suited to meet their needs.Consensus Opinion On Zillow (Mixed): Analysts have a mean price target of $82. The range of price targets is very dispersed with a range of $43-$105. Analysts are projecting an average of $188 million in revenue for FY 2013 and an average of $260 million in revenue for FY 2014. Earnings are estimated at an average of -$.05 for FY 2013 and $.59 for FY 2014.My View: I am in line with the analysts on this company and feel it is currently overpriced. I did not construct a standalone operating model for this company but rather looked at some of the major elements of this company's financials and what will ultimately drive the stock price. Let me say, I like this business and obviously they are taking on a large market with a demonstrated willingness of its users to pay-I just feel the valuation is too rich at this level given you can buy comparable companies in huge markets with similar growth for cheaper. Note this is not a pure valuation call, I think valuation calls can be extremely dangerous which is why I did not short LinkedIn (LNKD) even though it looked ridiculously priced at $200. I am assuming the market will continue to value these companies at very high P/E ratios, but I see Zillow comparatively overvalued even by applying those high valuations. I test out some of the assumptions of why zillow would command a higher forward P/E than its peers in my thesis.How Does Zillow Make Money? Company generates revenues from local real estate professionals, primarily on an individual subscription basis, and from mortgage professionals and brand advertisers. Their Premier Agent program allows local real estate agents to establish a persistent online and mobile presence on Zillow in the zip codes they serve. They present contact information for each Premier Agent alongside home profiles and home listings within the agent's zip code, assisting consumers in evaluating and selecting the real estate agent best suited for them. Pricing for their Premier Agent subscriptions varies by zip code. The company also does display advertising, no shocker there.Catalysts (How we get paid):-Company will increasingly have to spend more in SG&A as a percent of sales resulting in a multiple compression to bring valuation more in line with peer group.-Slowdown in revenue growth-Missing analyst expectations-Increased competition: Obviously competition is already occurring in the form of Trulia (TRLA) and Move (NASDAQ:MOVE) but some of the larger mortgage companies are entering the space.Scenario Analysis:Good Risk/Reward BalanceUpside Case: The company comes in line with high end of analyst expectations and comes in at $.80 EPS. With a P/E ratio of 80 (round up from 78 median of peer group conservatively) you get a price of $64 (30% upside). Note conservatively, my price target is $70 and I would look to exit once I see the stock dip below that.Downside Case (Actually the upside scenario): Company beats analysts expectations and stronger growth commands a significantly higher P/E than peer group. Using 2014 EPS of $.80 and a P/E of 120(Significantly above peer group) you get a price of $96 (4.4% downside)Valuation:Comparable Company Analysis:Valuation looks extremely expensive compared to other similarly sized fast growing internet companies operating in large marketsThe question then becomes why is this company at a significant valuation premium to its peer group?Is the company projected to grow revenue at a much quicker pace?Based on analyst estimates company appears to be growing its revenue in line with peersDoes the company have significantly better margins (TTM), i.e. their revenue means more to an investor?No, Company has negative(N/A) margins and still has not built a sustainable business with positive margins yet like Opentable (NASDAQ:OPEN) has.Is Zillow Priced correctly from a valuation perspective and the other companies in its peer groups are actually the undervalued companies? Internet valuations are already very high, this one does not halt my thesis. Public markets have been very kind with valuing companies such as Linkedin & Yelp does not seem likely peer group is dramatically undervaluedAre Analysts off on their projections? Possibly this is one of the core risks, but analysts for this company are projecting strong revenue growth alreadyRisk Factors (How Shorts Get Burned):-Company beats analyst expectations on Revenue or EPS through expanding into new niches of the housing segment, improving margins significantly or capturing more than predicted market share-Valuation stays extremely rich on high future growth prospects of the businessDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1612402,22149,2013-08-07T08:16:15-04:00,,"Real estate is back and nearly every housing-related stock has seen significant improvement over the past two years. Homebuilders (NYSEARCA:XHB) have benefited immensely, alongside home improvement chains Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), as well as building supplies makers such as Masco (NYSE:MAS). Real estate website operators Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and Trulia (TRLA) have been no exceptions to this rule, with Z up over 125% and TRLA up almost 80% in a 12-month timeframe.Of course, there's more to these two companies than merely a real estate rebound. Both Zillow and Trulia are high-growth firms looking to transform the way the real estate market works. That's why both companies have become a fascination amongst investors.I agree with the growth thesis on a basic level. Jeff Chmielewski presents a great argument that a recovering housing market bodes well for both, and both sites saw their prospects lag a bit due to the housing market collapse during their early years. On the other hand, I don't think there's any way to possibly justify the valuations for either firm, even in a best-case growth scenario.In this article, I want to make the case that Zillow is one of the most overpriced stocks on the American markets right now. I could pen a similar article for Trulia, but I think Zillow provides more juicy material.1. Few Companies Have Been Cheap at Over 20x RevenuesBased upon its last four quarters, Zillow now sells at 23 times revenues. Very few publicly-traded companies have turned out to be good investments at over 20x revenues. The simple truth is that it's difficult for a company to 'outperform' the broader market with such huge expectations priced into the stock already.It's not completely impossible, mind you. Apple would've been a great investment at almost any price in 2000. Of course, that was a turn-around story where Apple introduced wildly successful new products that the market had not anticipated. That seems very unlikely here.Google is another great example. At the end of 2005, Google traded at 22 times revenues (thanks to an assist from Conor Sen for this info nugget). We can examine the company and the stock over the 7-yr period from the end of FY 2005 to the end of FY 2012.As you can see, Google achieved annualized growth of 35% in revenues, 29% in operating margins, 33% in earnings, and 30% in earnings per share. That's an astounding track record over a 7-year period and you'd hard pressed to find many companies in the US over the past few decades that could match that.In spite of that otherworldly run of growth, Google's stock achieved a modest 6.8% annualized return over that same 7-year time frame. It's a respectable return given that the S&P 500 only returned 1.9% annually over the same period, but it's not the 'blow-you-away' type of returns that might be implied by 30% annual earnings growth. Indeed, if you invested in a 7-yr treasury bond at the same time, you would've generated a 4.32% yield.In other words, if you invested in one of the most wildly profitable and rapidly growing companies of the past century at 22x revenues at the end of 2005, you would've slightly outperformed a 7-year US treasury bond. It's not bad, but it speaks to the type of expectations that are already priced in at over 20x sales.It's difficult to nearly impossible to meet expectations at this sort of valuation. Unfortunately, Zillow also does not look anything like Google.2. Sales & MarketingOn the face of it, Zillow may seem like a prototypical game-changing tech company. In reality, Zillow is a low-tech sales organization. Citron Research made this very point in their negative report on Zillow in September 2012. Citron may be a bit overly bearish on Z, but they are correct about Zillow when it comes to sales generation.Zillow generates most of its revenues from real estate agents. It often does so by calling them on the phone. While Z's sales expenses have varied over time, they have generally bounced around in the 40% to 60% of revenue range. In the most recent quarter, sales expense was 51% of revenues.There's nothing wrong with this business model per se (my view differs from Citron's significantly on that point). It's just that it's not the type of business that you'd generally want to pay 23 times revenue for. There's a major difference between a company like Google and a company like Zillow, and that brings me to the next point.3. Zillow Lacks Operating LeverageRapid-growth tech companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN), and LinkedIn (LNKD), all have something Zillow lacks: a high degree of operating leverage.Operating leverage is a very important concept in valuation. For a company with high operating leverage, a very large chunk of every incremental dollar of revenue goes directly to profits. Whereas, a company with low operating leverage would likely need to spend a large amount (e.g. 90 cents) to generate a $1 of revenue. The key issue here is fixed costs vs. variable costs. Businesses with high operating leverage are characterized by high fixed costs and low variable costs.As an example, consider Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) streaming service. Let's say Netflix pays $8 million for all of its content and spends $2 million on the technology to develop its offerings. For every new customer, it also has $1 in variable wage expenses and Netflix offers its streaming service for $5. In essence, Netflix makes $4 of profit for every $5 of revenues, but has a fixed cost hump to get over first. Let's do an example.In Scenario #1, Netflix gets 1 million customers. That's $5 million in revenue versus $10 million in fixed expenses, and $1 million in variable expenses for a total loss of $6 million. Netflix looks very bad in this scenario, but that's only because the number of customers is too low. With more customers, things dramatically improve.In Scenario #2, Netflix gets 10 million subscribers. That's $50 million in revenue, but the fixed costs stay the same at $10 million. The variable costs increase to $10 million. That leaves Netflix with a $30 million profit. Netflix's profit margin went from -120% to +60% with the addition of 9 million customers, but not every business works that way.The point of these scenarios is to showcase that for each incremental dollar of revenue NFLX generates, $4 of that goes directly to the bottom line. Thus, in this example, Netflix has a high degree of operating leverage. (Netflix's model in the real world is similar, but one big issue is that content providers can jack up prices - and hence fixed costs - over time.)Zillow looks very little like Netflix in the example above. Zillow relies upon sales staff to make most of its revenues. As I pointed out in the previous section, about 50% of Z's revenues go towards sales and marketing. Add in the general and administrative expenses and you're already eating up somewhere from 60% - 75% of each new dollar of revenue. Then, another 5% or so is going to share-based compensation.Technology and development (currently around 22% of revenues) may be one of the few areas where Z has some operating leverage. One might argue based on this (and a few other expenses) that Z has moderate operating leverage, but that's a best case scenario and it's certainly a far cry away from Google (i.e. the search engine), LinkedIn, Netflix, or even OpenTable.Once again, this isn't necessarily bad. The mass-retailer Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and consulting giant Accenture (NYSE:ACN) are two great examples of highly successful firms with lower operating leverage. Both are excellent firms, but you wouldn't want to pay 20x revenues for a firm with that type of business model. I can't see any rationale how Zillow can justify at 23x sales valuation with low-to-moderate operating leverage.4. Cash Flow NegativeIt's not totally shocking that a young firm would be cash flow negative, but when you combine it with the three aforementioned factors, it becomes a bigger head-scratcher. Remember, Google was wildly profitable at the end of 2005 when it sold at over 20x revenues, and its free cash flow picture was even more desirable.Zillow's cash flows, on the other hand, have not looked very good.Operating cash flows for Zillow look attractive on the face of it, but they are also a bit misleading. For one, the two big items propping that figure up are depreciation / amortization and share compensation expense. The former is almost always offset by capex. While share compensation expense is technically a non-cash expense, it does dilute the value of the stock, therefore I tend to exclude it from cash flow calculations.Then, you also have to factor in a large string of acquisitions in 2011 and 2012. Acquisitions have become Zillow's main source of capex at this juncture. Once you examine these factors, Zillow has never really been cash flow positive and their best year was 2011 with a cash flow loss of $2.5 million.As I've said in every section thus far, this capex driven model is not necessarily bad and many young businesses have negative free cash flows. At the same time, I can't understand why I'd pay 23x revenues for this type of unproven business model, especially when a massive amount of capex is going towards acquisitions.5. Skepticism About AcquisitionsSpeaking of acquisitions, we ought to take a look at those. Zillow has been on an acquisition spree, buying RentJuice for $38 million, Mortech for $12 million (and stock), and HotPads for $16 million in 2012. As with most things in this article, it's not necessarily a case of whether acquisition-driven growth is good or bad, but that (A) it tends to be riskier than organic growth and (B) it's more difficult to earn an ""abnormal profit"" from acquisitions.When I say ""abnormal profit,"" I am suggesting that it's difficult to earn an extremely high internal rate of return [""IRR""] on an acquisition, whereas, I'd wager to guess that tech firms like Google and Apple have encountered situations where organic investments had projected IRRs of 50%+.Whether the HotPads and Rent Juice acquisitions were smart for Zillow is a good debate to have, but the bigger point and theme that I continue to hammer: why would I pay 23x revenues for this type of business model? Does Zillow have such a huge advantage in acquiring companies at discount prices, and then integrating them in wildly successful fashion, so as to justify a 23x sales valuation? Probably not.There are a lot of companies that do acquisitions well, but they almost never get assigned a huge sales multiple, like a high-tech firm primarily driven by organic growth. To put it simply, acquisition based growth is not ""cheap"" and there is much less low-hanging fruit.6. CompetitionAnother big issue with the Zillow story is competition. Obviously, there's Trulia, but there's also Move (NASDAQ:MOVE), which runs realtor.com, and Redfin. This distinguishes Zillow from companies like Facebook and LinkedIn, which are essentially near-monopolies in their own market niches.By the way, for an excellent read on Redfin, check out this Newsweek article, ""Why Redfin, Zillow, and Trulia Haven't Killed Off Real Estate Brokers."" The grander theme of the article is that the online real estate sites haven't radically changed the way real estate is bought and sold. While Redfin's model was more ambitious than Trulia and Zillow, the basic thrust here is that none of these companies are truly disruptive. Trulia and Zillow may help get real estate listings into a more visible and heavily trafficked place, but it seems unlikely that they will take more than a very small piece of the pie.Unlike Google and LinkedIn, Zillow appears to be a small piece of the overall value chain, and faces significant competition even for that niche.7. Heavy Insider SellingIt's difficult to blame officers at Zillow for selling off their shares. If most of us were in the same situation, with a good chunk of our wealth tied to one risky, early-stage business, we'd certainly do the same thing. It's always wise to diversify your wealth a bit, especially after the value of your business increases 5-fold in a few years.At the same time, heavy insider selling is rarely a sign that a stock is attractive. By my estimates, using Yahoo Finance data, it would appear that insiders have dumped over $120 million in shares over the past year. That's a lot and reminds me of similar rounds of insider dumping at overvalued companies, such as First Solar in 2008.I can't blame any of Zillow's officers for banking a cool million or two, which should buy them prosperity for the rest of their lives. But the extreme level of insider selling suggests to me that Zillow's officers are also skeptical about the valuation.The Good: Revenue GrowthWith all the negative arguments ironed out, it's time to look at the positive. The biggest positive is rapid revenue growth which can be seen in the chart below:Not a lot of companies are growing revenues 77% YOY or achieving a 61% annualized growth rate over the past four years. This is one reason why Zillow probably deserves a high multiple; just maybe not 23x revenues.Both Zillow and Trulia will continue to grow, as more real estate listings come online, and it's likely that more agents will turn to these companies in the future. More site visitors will result in higher ad revenue, and more agents buying in will increase Zillow's position within the market.I won't iron out the complete bull case, which I think you can find countless other number of places, but certainly, I view Zillow as a high-growth company, with a good product, and a great future. It's likely a great place to work right now, as rapid growth also means more advancement opportunities. It's just that the stock is very, very expensive.ValuationValuing early-stage, high-growth firms is always a difficult task, but I'll take a stab at it with Zillow. Given the moderate-to-low operating leverage in the industry, coupled with moderate prospective operating margins, I'd suggest that Zillow should sell closer to 5x revenues, rather than 20x revenues.There are still significant risks in this industry, and the otherworldly growth of the past four years will likely slow down in upcoming years. Given Zillow's lack of profit history, it pays to be a bit conservative here, but at the same time, you can't ignore the revenue growth, so somewhere around 4x - 5x sales seems reasonable.At 5x revenues, Zillow's market cap would be $665 million and the stock price would be around $20. Its current market cap is about $3.1 billion and the stock price is $90. These are 1999-era tech valuations and even if Zillow is a great company with a great future, the stock will likely yield highly negative returns going forward.Betting Against ZillowWhile the inflated valuation might tempt one to initiate a short position or buy put options, I'd proceed with caution on that front. The stock is heavily shorted, with Yahoo Finance reporting that 46% of the outstanding shares are short. Likewise, put options are extremely expensive. To buy 2015 put options, and come out with a significant (100%+ profit), you have to bet on the stock price correcting an awful lot; not necessarily something I'd want to do with an extreme momentum stock like Zillow.Therefore, my recommendation is to keep away on the long side, and be cautious on the short side.Post-NoteI authored this article before yesterday's after-market plunge in Zillow and Trulia. It doesn't really change the basic thesis of the article, but would alter some of the multiples and figures a bit.ConclusionsZillow (as well as Trulia) are both great companies with bright futures. Both will see rapid growth in the upcoming years, as well, but paying 23x revenues for Zillow is a poor investment strategy. At such an elevated price level, the odds of making a reasonable return is very low. Even Google at the end of 2005 (which sold at 22x sales), only yielded a 6.8% annualized return over the next seven years (vs. a 4.3% yield on a 7-yr treasury), and Google had high operating leverage, a proven business model with sky-high margins, and is one of the greatest success stories of the past century.Zillow may be a great company, but it's not Google. This is a good real estate services firm that may churn out reasonable margins sometime within the next few years. That probably makes it worth closer to $20 - $25 per share, rather than $90.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

They have the opportunity to change industry dynamics, leading to excellent returns for investors who buy at the right price.Price, of course, dictates investment return and risk. Warren Buffett once said that buying at too high a price can undue a decade of favorable business results.So, at a $2.4 billion valuation, is Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) priced too high to deliver high risk-adjusted returns, even with a disruptive model in the real estate industry?The Business:Zillow is a home and real estate marketplace dedicated to helping homeowners, home buyers, sellers, renters, real estate agents, mortgage professionals, landlords and property managers find and share vital information about homes, real estate, mortgages and home improvement. We are transforming the way consumers make home-related decisions and connect with professionals. [Investor Website]The business model is similar to LinkedIn (LNKD), where the value of the model comes in the form of the network. While LinkedIn provides valuable information to its users in the form of professional connections, job postings, industry news, et cetera, Zillow provides home buyers with critical information related to one of the biggest financial decisions of one's life: buying a home. This information includes sales prices of comparable properties, mortgage rates and access to real estate agents, among other things.Herein lies the value of Zillow: with a growing database of information related to real estate, it attracts users looking for transparent and digestable information which, in turn, attracts real estate agents, mortgage lenders, real estate appraisers and other parties interested in the real estate transaction process. And because the user base is growing, the entities who stand to benefit from transactions are willing to pay for a premium account or advertise on the site.It is the holy grail of business models: a scalable, low cost platform, which derives its value from additional users on the site, a perpetuating cycle. And Zillow deals in an industry, real estate, which is not subject to foreign competition: there will always be real estate transactions in the U.S., and real estate sales appear to be on the uptick.The business model is extremely light: gross margins are in the 85% range, and Zillow is transforming its model to rely on both advertising, but also high margin, sticky and recurring revenue streams from Software-as-a-Service (""SaaS"") web applications.Price and ValueZillow currently trades at 7600 times last 12 months' earnings, 17 times sales and 8 times book value. Those are very rich valuation multiples to be sure, but Zillow's model is extending into adjacent markets and developing new offerings, such as Digs, a Pinterest style web application for users to curate their favorite home designs, and potentially creating another revenue stream through affiliate sales.Zillow is also building out its capabilities in the $5 billion rental market.Finally, the most interesting part of the business is its network of premiere agents who are monthly subscribers to advertise properties. There are 34,030 premiere agents, up 83% year-over-year, and the total addressable market is large: there are 2.1 million real estate agents in the U.S. As the real estate market picks up, it is likely more real estate agents will turn to Zillow's premiere agent service to attract more leads and conversions.Sometimes the best value is in a moat-like operating model with explosive growth, even though the current valuation multiples make ""value"" investors fret with worry. The Zillow model is interesting because of the leverage in the operating model: as sales ramp, more of the profits drop to the bottom line because of its low cost, scalable platform. Therefore, traditional value investors may miss out on this operating model.CompetitionZillow's total addressable market is quite large, but it is not without competition. The most obvious competitor is Trulia (TRLA), a smaller player, but with an attractive, easy-to-use web application providing similar services.To me, this digital real estate market is a land grab. Once Zillow and/or Trulia become entrenched with large user bases, it will be harder for new entrants to steal share since the value is in the network. An established network, then, is the moat that will protect Zillow and/or Trulia.ConclusionI like the Zillow operating model. But as a ""contrarian"" investor, Zillow is a little too in favor with investors for my taste. Like with any company though, exuberance can turn into pessimism at a moment's notice. If that happens combined with a significant drop in price, Zillow may become interesting. The short interest in the name is very high at 41%, so I think it's better to stand on the sidelines because of the rich valuation and because I generally eschew momentum stocks and ones that are heavily shorted.I just hope Zillow isn't the one that got away.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1577412,48631,2013-07-26T16:16:09-04:00,,"Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posted an amazing second quarter and the market rewarded it by increasing the stock price over 30%. This news also sent other online ""middle-men"" companies upwards as Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) closed 6% up, LinkedIn (LNKD) closed 1% up and Trulia (TRLA) almost 2%. In this transcript from CNBC.COM, Jim Cramer explains the excitement that is coming back to the ""dot-com"" industry that relies primarily on website traffic to generate most of its revenue. So as the giants like Facebook and LinkedIn post monster quarters, investors are looking to the next big thing. Here is a chart from Alexa.com that shows the leaders and two of these ""dot-com"" companies from the online real estate advertising industry that have a lot of room to grow:In this chart we look closer at the online and mobile unique visitors for these companies and compare their growth:This chart shows Facebook having slower growth because it is literally running out of people in the world that have access to computers and mobile devices. With more than a billion users using Facebook per month, its growth has slowed considerably and thus that is a big reason why it is trading at a forward P/E of 37. However, LinkedIn, Zillow and Trulia have been posting up and down quarters, but have all grown visitors by more than 30% in the last quarter. So the potential is there and interest is growing in these companies, but let us now look at how this site traffic is translating to the bottom line. Here we will look at revenues, costs and margin rates. First here is a chart for revenue growth:We can see why Facebook's share price jumped by more than 30% after posting revenue growth of 24% in Q2. The other companies have been showing growth in single digits to growth in the teens, which is disappointing for companies that have the ""tech start up"" or ""growth company"" tag on them. This ""growth company"" tag is one in which analysts see a lot of potential and expect high double-digit growth between each quarter. So we will see if Zillow, LinkedIn and Trulia can impress again by posting at least 25% growth in Q2, anything short of that might be a huge disappointment since Zillow is trading at a P/E of 8,434, LinkedIn at a P/E of 803 and Trulia currently is negative on earnings so it does not have a P/E ratio.Another thing that investors look at is if these online start up companies, which live off of site traffic and thus have to spend a lot to get it, can control their costs. Here is a chart showing the costs for the previous five quarters:From this chart we see that LinkedIn is getting expenses under control, but Zillow and Trulia are still having a tough time decreasing spend without sacrificing revenue growth. However, this is a gamble that can potentially pay off as Facebook posted a great quarter even with higher spending. But the bottom line, profit margin, tells a better story about revenue and spending. Here is a chart showing the profit margins of these companies:So this chart explains why spending did not have an effect on Facebook's quarter, because it improved margins by 22%, which is an amazing thing to do for such a large company. LinkedIn is also growing profit margins tremendously and that is another reason why a lot of people are excited about LinkedIn. However, both Zillow and Trulia are having a very tough time improving profit margins, due to high spending and that is a cause of concern to a lot of investors. These companies will have to show investors a turnaround in this metric in the upcoming quarters to be considered having a viable future operating model.To conclude this analysis, a good way to get a sense of the overall sentiment about all of these metrics and boil it down into one, is looking at analyst recommendations. Since analysts cover these companies in depth and their jobs depend on getting recommendations correctly, they have a very important viewpoint that should be taken into account. Here is a chart showing analyst sentiment for these companies:As shown by the chart, the analysts called the Facebook quarter correctly as they kept on raising their guidance over the past several months closer to a Strong Buy. LinkedIn has been hovering around a ""Buy"" rating but Zillow and Trulia have slipped in the past several months as analysts decreased their expectations slightly. Thus after taking everything into account, the established Internet companies like Facebook and LinkedIn are showing a lot of life and growth, but investors should take a lot into account before thinking other low-margin Internet companies can repeat this growth. Zillow, and to some extent Trulia, has grown a lot in the past several months, but investors must take into account their Shares Short of Float Ratio, which is 25% for Zillow and 17% for Trulia. So investors have to consider that due to the excitement and big growth from Internet companies like Facebook, a lot of the share growth for Zillow and Trulia has been due to a possible big short squeeze before second-quarter earnings come out. Investors should take all of this into account before earnings are released and decide whether or not the current share price is a good place to buy into or go on the short side.Disclosure: I am short Z.

This is unexpected, and will likely be a big revenue growth driver for Trulia.Trulia has a wait-list for more than 10% of the ZIP codes in the U.S., and the ad-pricing on these wait-list ZIP codes is typically 50% to 200% higher than average (i.e. Real Estate Agents pay more to advertise in Beverly Hills than middle-of-nowhere Montana).In March 2013 when Trulia expanded ad units from 1-per-ZIP to 2, the company reported a big revenue number for the quarter ($24.0 million versus the consensus estimate of $21.1 million), which drove an increase of more than 11% in the stock the next day.The data for this new expansion from 2-ad-units-per-ZIP to 3 appears similar. Wait-list ZIP codes have ""ready to buy"" demand at a price 100% above average. If all of the wait-listed ZIP codes sold their 3rd ad unit, it would be a step-function +20% increase in Ad Revenue (well above the 8.5% ad revenue growth Trulia guided for in Q4)!Event WatchInvestors will be asking management how the ""testing"" of the 3rd unit is going when they meet with them, and there is at least one event in the very near future where management could answer that question (either publicly or privately):(Trulia Event Calendar for November: Source: www.eventforesight.comAdditionally, there are at least 4 potential wall street conferences Trulia Management could present at in early December, and a update will be provided by either:It is also worth nothing that Trulia shares were up nearly 10% on November 13th, where management also presented at a conference (see calendar above). It is possible that management has already let a few investors know about the ad unit expansion (and its success) at that conference, but the newswire is attributing the move to rumors of a potential acquisition. We will never know which is correct (or maybe its a bit of both); but even if management has started to tell investors about the success of the ad expansion testing, only a small portion of investors are privy to the info, and the news should continue to place upward pressure on Trulia shares.Last, Trulia investors should pay close attention to the events of competitors Zillow(Z) and Move, Inc. (MOVE) as well. As detailed in the figure below, Trulia's stock price exhibits exceedingly strong volatility when Zillow or Move, Inc. have a key event; Trulia's price changes by an average of 10% the day after Move, Inc. reports earnings and by more than 6% when Zillow reports earnings--far above the volatility internet companies typically report when a competitor releases earnings.As such, Trulia investors should also closely monitor the events of these two companies due to the high-volatility-risk these events present for Trulia.(Trulia's Holistic Event-Impact-Analysis; Source: www.eventforesight.comDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1645952,25120,2013-08-20T07:47:46-04:00,,"Shares of Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) are seeing a modest correction after the US real estate and home-related marketplace announced the acquisition of StreetEasy.After a great run-up so far this year, amidst optimism in the US housing market, the current momentum might have been too strong. This could leave shares vulnerable for a short - term correction.That being said, the long - term prospects for a market leader like Zillow remains good. The absolute valuation is still very moderate compared to the large market opportunity if the company manages to monetize its traffic and information effectively.The DealZillow announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire StreetEasy, the leading real estate website in New York City in a deal valuing the company at $50 million.StreetEasy's websites attract 1.2 million unique users on a monthly basis. Having access to Zillow's resources gives the company the possibility to invest in product development and grow the audience further. In comparison, Zillow's websites attract 61 million unique users on a monthly basis.StreetEasy was founded in 2006 and employs 34 workers. The website provides for-sale and for-rent listings having partnerships with the largest local real estate brokerages.The deal is subject to normal closing conditions and is expected to close in a few weeks' time.Signaling A High ValuationWhile Zillow has sufficient financial resources to finance the deal and its operating losses, the company has announced an issue of 2.5 million shares of common stock, thereby raising a little over $200 million in cash.Another 2.52 million shares will be offered by selling shareholders.ValuationZillow ended its second quarter with $169.7 million in cash, equivalents and short - term investments. The company operates without the assumption of debt, for a favorable net cash position.Revenues for the first six months of the year came in at $85.9 million, up 70% on the year before. The company reported a $14.0 million loss compared to a modest profit of $3.1 million the year before.Full year revenues are seen between $186 and $188 million, while Zillow expects to generate EBITDA of $20 million.Factoring in losses of about 6% in Monday's trading session, with shares exchanging hands at $85 per share, the market values Zillow at $3.0 billion. This values operating assets of the firm around $2.9 billion, or roughly 16 times annual revenues.Zillow does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveZillow went public in July of 2011. Shares traded within a $25-$45 trading range till January of this year. Shares broke out and reached all - time highs of $97 in recent weeks on the back of the housing recovery and Obama's appearance at Zillow's website to answer questions from Zillow's users.Zillow has rapidly increased its operations in recent years. Annual revenues rose from merely $17.5 million in 2009 to an expected $187 million in 2013. While the company has turned losses into modest profits in recent years, Zillow is on track to report a large loss this year.Investment ThesisThe reported $50 million price tag for StreetEasy is a lot in absolute terms for a company with merely 34 employees, operating a website with 1.2 million unique visitors per month.Yet the relative price tag is equivalent to Zillow's own valuation, or occurs at a slight discount to its own valuation. Zillow paid $42 per unique visitor per month for StreetEasy, which compares to its own valuation of around $51 per unique visitor for Zillow itself.New York is a crucial local market to conquer for Zillow and the gained techniques and insights could be used nationwide as the city is one of the toughest real estate markets. The announced equity issue of more than $200 million implies Zillow might make more acquisitions to fortify its market leading position. At current levels, Zillow thinks its stock offers a great currency of exchange at elevated levels, after nearly tripling year to date.Zillow has seen competition from Trulia (TRLA) which bolstered its market position after acquiring Market Leader (NASDAQ:LEDR) back in May of this year. Still, both companies have been winners, both having seen astonishing returns this year. The continued housing recovery and need for reliable and timely information has boosted interest in both Zillow's and Trulia's shares.While both firms are very expensive on revenue multiples, not to mention price-earnings multiples, the absolute valuations remain rather modest. Zillow is now valued around $3 billion while Trulia is valued at $1.4 billion. These are still relative amounts for market leaders in the information provision for consumers on the housing markets.While both companies still have to generate meaningful earnings going forward, they have time to figure out their definitive business model. Shorting any of these names on current valuation multiples doesn't make sense, as sometimes you need a bit of imagination.That's not to say that shares in both firms are an absolute buy. I think the recent strong momentum leaves the shares in both Zillow and Trulia vulnerable to a short term correction. Yet the long - term prospects remain good when these companies find the balance between subscription offerings, advertising solutions and a high quality database full of information.As such I remain cautious in the short term, but could have a renewed look after a possible correction in the coming weeks. At a discount I might be willing to pick up a stake in these highly promising long - term businesses.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1593862,48631,2013-08-01T10:11:06-04:00,,"The Q2 2013 earnings report for Trulia (TRLA) had several highlights that caused after-hour investors to raise the price by 11%. The major highlight was that if the company removes stock-based compensation and an acquisition for the quarter, they go from a loss of $0.07 a share to an adjusted earnings of $0.05 a share. In this article, I will share the highlights and analyze why I do not believe they are worthy of the current stock price. Here are several highlights taken from the Trulia.com earnings report:Although the year-over-year growth seems impressive, there are two reasons why I believe a lot of investors are misreading these results. The first reason is that the revenue growth seems to be directly proportional to spending by the company to grow revenue, just like its main competitor Zillow (NASDAQ:Z). This in turn leads to very low margins and, in Trulia's case, negative margins, as their net income was a loss of 0.07 cents per share. In the charts below, we can see that the highlighted revenue and expenses figures seem to be directly proportional and have been for the past several quarters:Click to enlarge images.So, as per the past quarters, it seems as if spending has driven up the revenue while sacrificing profit margin. This may be a strategy to gain market share, but then again it can be a business model that can never recover from this type of revenue generation. My belief is that this ""middle-man"" business model can never have great margins as these companies will always have to spend a lot to get website traffic, which in turns leads to higher revenues.The second point, which I think investors are missing, is that they are looking year over year vs. quarter over quarter, since the housing market is rising every quarter. Here is a report from Cenus.gov that shows home sales rising every month and the overall housing market growing:So, investors should look at growth from one strong quarter to the next in a rising market vs. a much weaker housing market at the beginning of 2012, which no doubt would make the numbers in a stronger market look better when compared to this year's quarters. Taking that into account, here are a couple more key metrics that show how Trulia and companies like Zillow (Z) and Move, Inc. (NASDAQ:MOVE) generate the majority of their revenues:The unique visitors, subscribers, and subscriber rate are not very impressive from Q1 to Q2 for a ""growth company"" -- even though the real estate market seems to be growing a lot stronger with growing home sales.In conclusion, investors are currently very excited about the year-over-year growth for revenue, unique monthly users, and subscribers. But two things should be pointed out: One, the growth is not that impressive for a ""growth company,"" which is a company with a very high current price-per-earnings ratio, quarter over quarter. Two, the spend is rising quarter over quarter. If an investor feels as if the company can break away from the low margins at some point and grow naturally without having to keep increasing spend, then this might be a great company to invest in. However, I believe that the Internet ad sales market that Trulia and its peers operate in is currently very overpriced for their future potential, which in my eyes seems to be increased spending to generate higher revenue growth.Disclosure: I am short Z.

1854491,22148,2013-11-21T09:19:40-05:00,,"After reviewing the top gainers in the S&P 500 since March 9, 2009 provided by Bespoke Investment Group, one stock really stuck out. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) generated one of the largest gains at nearly 1,000% during that period. What really stood out is that Chipotle unlike other stocks on the list was considered a high quality company all along yet it presented several extreme-buying opportunities over those years.Using that same general concept of buying quality stocks on dips, a couple of top performing companies with huge opportunities really stick out. Both Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) have very desirable, market leading models. The issue is that the stocks trade at high multiples that make the stocks difficult to purchase at the current levels. Following the Chipotle example, the market will provide several opportunities in the future to buy these stocks at lower multiples. The key is whether investors are prepared and ready to pounce when it occurs.Chipotle ExampleThe Bespoke list includes stocks in the S&P 1500 that soared over 1,000% during that time period. The problem with this list is that the majority of the stocks were difficult to predict that huge gains were ahead. In the cast of the S&P 500 list, a few stocks including Chipotle probably could've been predicted to have a strong future.Chipotle went public back in 2006 after being spun off from McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). The stock surged over the next couple of years to reach over $150, but the financial collapse at the end of 2008 caused the stock to collapse. As the chart below shows, the stock surged over the next couple of years to reach over $440, yet not long after that fears about competition from the low end Mexican food providers in the form of Taco Bell sent the stock plunging below $250. That situation provided another extreme buying opportunity with the stock surging to over $500 within a year.CMG data by YChartsAll the while, investors claimed issues with high valuations and concerns about future growth. Analysts continue to expect long-term earnings growth of 21% and the stock trades at a forward PE of over 40. Clearly the stock trades at a maximum valuation even after all these years.The major point to apply to these other stocks is that an investor buying at $150 in late 2007 has a very different perspective and account balance than the one buying near the low in mid-2008. The 1,000% gain quickly dissapates into less than a 300% gain during a longer time period.Business AngleBoth Yelp and Zillow have the business angle similar to a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) as opposed to a social network. Consumers flock to the services in order to find their dream house or locate a great restaurant in the area. In both cases, the service isn't based on a social connection that may disappear in the future. It's all based on whether Yelp or Zillow provides the best option for obtaining the service desired by the customer.Yelp has the potential of becoming the new Yellow Pages and the provider of the best content on local businesses. The stock has surged to a market value of over $4 billion with expectations of revenue surging over 50% to $346 million next year.Zillow has the opportunity to be the dominant player in the online real estate marketplace. Home buyers looking for a house, mortgage, or real estate agent could flock to the associated websites. With a valuation just below $3 billion and revenue expected to be shy of $300 million next year, the stock trades at a high multiple, but revenue growth of 44% next year probably justifies it.Chart - revenue growthYELP Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsConclusionIn my opinion, the question isn't whether these stocks eventually reach valuations of $10 billion or even $20 billion, but whether investors can obtain the stocks at much lower valuations during periods of weakness along that path. The Chipotle Mexican Grill example suggests that periods of extreme weakness will occur in the future. Remember that Chipotle was one of the best performing stocks in the last few years, yet it had a couple of periods of roughly 50% declines. The smart investor will take advantage when it occurs to Yelp and Zillow and greatly enhance investor returns.Ultimately this theory applies to any high quality stocks, the key being that investors must do research prior to a collapse to identify the quality stocks. Finally when the major selloff occurs it shoiuld be relished and pounced on in order to achieve these outsized gains.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1527832,48631,2013-06-30T03:38:47-04:00,,"When coming up on a quarterly earnings call, it is important to monitor what the big investors are doing. Here is a screener from Finviz.com that I have screened for stocks over $10, over 300k in average daily volume and very negative for insider transactions (<20%). Then the screener is sorted by negative institutional transactions.As you can see, Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) takes the number 5 position in this negative outlook. Also the insider sales by Zillow Management are very negative at -56.70% (this is a trailing 6 month total and institutional change is trailing 3 months). Taking a look in Yahoo Finance, the insider sales have continued into June as well as stock purchases (possibly bonuses) at very low options per share.So these two pieces of data can mean several different things. Some institutions feel that the price is a little high and know that price targets might be downgraded, so they are cutting back on their positions or are simply uncertain on the guidance of the company and scaling back for that reason. The insider transactions are a little more worrisome as it seems that management does not have faith that the price of the stock will remain that high after the next round of quarterly earnings and are cashing out.But on the other side, there have been some purchases as well, and the institution sell off, even though it is top 5 of all the companies screened above, it is not over 10% so the number is not very drastic. Also taking a look at this chart below of the stock price, one can tell that Zillow has been bouncing up and down in the 50-60 dollar range and institutions, who own most of this stock, are not willing to part with their shares until the quarterly earnings come out. But as the chart below shows, the support and resistance lines are nearing closer to each other and usually a stock either breaks up or breaks down once those two lines draw closer, so a decision on the price target for Zillow might soon be made by the market.To conclude, a wise investor should take a look at what the major holders of the stock are doing prior to quarterly releases as this might help you make a decision on a good entry point on a stock you like. With competitors like Trulia (TRLA), Move (NASDAQ:MOVE) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Adwords, the race for the real estate agent ad spend is heating up and investors should look at all the facts before deciding to buy a piece of a company.Disclosure: I am short Z.

1546812,48631,2013-07-12T15:01:57-04:00,,"When looking at other industries, a lot of time quarter-over-quarter results are looked at due to seasonality. But in the case of Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) a disappointing fact should be noted when looking ahead at the Q2 results. According to this article from Trulia.com, another leading online real estate website, the busy season for housing is in Q1. Zillow did very well against Q1 in 2012, but had low growth against Q4 of 2012, the slowest quarter of the year for housing. Here is a look at the numbers:The quarterly reports shows impressive stats over last year's Q1 and I have color coded those % changes that are impressive in green. But as mentioned above, the seasonality should have made for a lot stronger of a quarter going from historically the weakest real estate quarter (Q4) to the strongest (Q1). So comparing Q4 of 2012 to Q1 of 2013 there are a lot of unimpressive stats. They are unimpressive (even though they are positive growth, besides monthly rate of subs) because currently Zillow is priced as a ""growth"" stock and delivering 10-20% growth is what established companies do. These established companies also have P/E ratios that are reasonable compared to their counterparts, usually P/Es of 10-30 in the Dow Jones components. But Zillow is currently at a P/E ratio of 6,915. So when Zillow grows unique user stats by 35%, but only grows subscriptions by 15% and total revenue by 13%, those are very disappointing stats to me when looking at a ""growth company.""When entering into Q2 earnings, investors should take a look at this hiccup seriously. This might be a reason why Zillow management raised marketing spend to historic highs, to get more traffic and more interest as its growth over Q4 was not that impressive. It is also experiencing a lot more competition from Trulia (TRLA), Move, Inc. (NASDAQ:MOVE) and its rental market is seeing a lot of competition from start-ups like Zumper.com. Another area of concern is all of the insider selling outlined in this SeekingAlpha.com article. Lastly, this Forbes.com news bulletin says Citigroup initiated coverage of Zillow and pegged it as ""Neutral."" This is quite disappointing to Zillow bulls as it is saying to its investors that this is not a stock it is excited about right now and think it will perform in the general trend of the market, until further guidance. So investors should be cautious when looking at quarter-over-quarter results in an industry where seasonality should favor Q1 versus Q4 and especially when the company's stock price is currently valued on huge growth potential. The amount of new competition in this market and existing competition that is all vying for ad spend should warn investors that this space might be getting too crowded and high growth might be very hard to come by.Disclosure: I am short Z.

1533472,48631,2013-07-03T09:46:44-04:00,,"It seems like the online real estate marketing companies such as Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), Trulia (TRLA) and Move, Inc. (NASDAQ:MOVE) have figured out a way to grow their earnings, by raising advertising and sales department spend. In this article, we will take a quick look at why this type of business is currently a continual ""Catch-22,"" and the growing revenue that analysts are excited about is at the cost of profit margin.In these following quarterly earnings reports, you can see a correlation between increasing in ad / selling spend and higher increases in revenue. When the spend is increased slightly, all three competitors usually show moderate revenue increases and vice versa; with heavy spend increases the revenue increases jump. This might explain why Zillow has committed to a high spend increase in Q2 of 2013, to generate high revenue and keep subscriptions growth high to attract more investors. But the downfall to such a model is very low to negative profit margins and Zillow has forecasted a negative quarter to try to pull off a positive year.ZillowTruliaMoveThese quarterly earnings also re-affirm the spend vs. revenue growth model for this market by showing that all the companies keep their R&D spend steady. This spend for most companies is the growing spend as they need new innovative products and technology, but in this industry, they seem to grow by just increasing ads for their websites and their sales departments increasing calls to real estate agents to get them to sign up for services. The possible downfall with this model is that there might need to be a constant spend to keep web page views high and a constant growing spend to aggressively call agents to sell them services. This can be inferred by the fact that when this spend goes down, the revenue growth shrinks. Taking Zillow as an example, their biggest quarterly revenue jumps are when they increase spend by more than 30%. Their website revenue is growing slowly compared to their agent subscription rates. Thus the increase in spend is mostly targeting their core market, real estate agent subscriptions, but the fact that they cannot let up on the spend suggest that there can possibly be a high agent turnover rate. Since we do not know how many agents try Zillow out and then quit it, we cannot determine what amount of this spend correlates to loyal subscribers. If they are spending millions for a low rate of return (subscribers that leave them after a short period of time), then this high spend model will need to be constant. If Zillow can show investors that their spend is bringing in a lot of loyal subscribers with a low turnover rate, then this model might be effective in the end, but so far they have not shown this data.This correlation can further be seen by plotting the above spend vs. revenue percentages and seeing that the line of best fit always has a positive slope, easily showing that the higher their ad / selling spend the higher their revenue.Lastly the ""Catch-22"" for this business sector is that the profit margins are very small due to not being able to maintain high revenue without high spending.These three competitors have all operated below a 3% profit margin and in many quarters have reported negative profit margins. This further re-affirms that this industry needs to do a lot of work to break the vicious cycle of spending a lot to gain high percentage increases in revenue, but not being able to impact the bottom line. The analysts are attracted to the high percentage revenue growth, but who knows how long their attraction will last without seeing profit margins grow. Since this industry is somewhat new (Zillow and Trulia went public in the past several years), analysts are still hoping that the companies can capture the possible 5-10 billion spent on advertisements by real estate agents and possibly find other ways to break into the larger real estate market. But with continued low profit margins and giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) introducing innovative pay per click services like Google Adwords, which a lot of agents use and only pay for clicks to their ads, this industry might get the cold shoulder if they cannot start making better margins. Thus investors need to take into account the current way these companies are attracting investors by buying their revenue growth with high spending. This can sometimes be a great way to capture market share, but a company has to prove this is a viable long term business plan by showing they can also grow their profit margins. In my opinion, this does not seem to be the case from the past several quarterly reports from these companies.Disclosure: I am short Z. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1507872,48631,2013-06-18T10:00:14-04:00,,"When a company has nearly a 100% institutional ownership and a very low average trading volume (this Yahoo Finance chart shows the tremendous decline in volume signaling the loss of interest for the Zillow stock from the public), like in the case of Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), the price of the stock can skyrocket without any news. On top of this, the short % of float is a staggering 37.10% according to Yahoo Finance. This most likely means that all of the institutions are hedging their bets and taking a short side as well as they do not fully believe the current price level is justified. But another key fact is that individual investors are most likely selling this stock short and when they do so, their brokerages have to buy Zillow stock, which continues to drive the price up. These uncertain bets can be explained by Zillow being a ""growth stock"" (analysts deem a stock with very low earnings, but having the possibility for aggressive growth), since its EPS is currently 0.01, giving it a P/E ratio of 6,276, which is one of the highest P/E ratio's of any publicly traded companies.The current run up in price is a multi-level bet by financial institutions that Zillow's continued aggressive marketing will directly translate into higher website traffic and higher sales through the website (by signing up more real estate agents to premiere packages). The Zillow CEO is selling analysts on the idea that the market for real estate advertising spend is $5 Billion higher than what a survey from real estate agents puts it at, according to my previous article on SeekingAlpha.com, which references that survey. Thus when analysts look at industries, like the real estate industry, that will most likely rebound in the upcoming years, they look at companies that can have big profits from the rebound. However, as the real estate industry rebounds, real estate agents might not have to work as hard to bring in business, so some are not sold on the theory of tying Zillow so closely to the real estate rebound. This can be seen in this following chart, showing aggressive insider selling and planned sales by Zillow's management after the stock shot up.Lastly Zillow is betting it all on advertising, increasing ad spend to $15M, and willing to take a negative quarter(s) to try to gain more traction with average households around the country. This plan is summarized quickly in this Wall Street Journal article, and some would say is a desperate measure to compete with up and coming competitors like Trulia (TRLA) and Redfin.com, which plans to go public in the near future. Although Zillow is currently the best known real estate website out there, the competitors are gaining traction, which will test Zillow's earnings in the upcoming quarters. Since Zillow offers little additional value to its competitors (all these sites simply show housing data and their value is selling the real estate agents their site traffic in the way of traffic to the agent's listings), the earnings will go to the company with the most traffic. Thus Zillow is betting a lot of money (and will most likely have a negative second quarter) on low viewed cable networks such as CNN, HGTV and USA to garner more interest in their website. Only USA had several shows in the Top 25 at the end of May, according to this article, but most people have DVR service, where they record shows and skip the commercials when they watch them. Thus this marketing strategy is risky and Zillow is betting almost half of its quarterly revenue on this increased ad spend.In conclusion, investors should be wary of the current price of Zillow. The shares available are very scarce thus the movement is heavily based upon short sellers and institutions trading with each other. The housing rebound seems to still be alive and housing starts, according to this article, are expected to continue to grow. But with a stronger economy, the Fed may ease or stop economic easing, which most analysts say would bring the Dow Jones back down to reality. This should be given careful consideration as Zillow has a Beta of 1.7, which can bring the stock tumbling if the overall market makes a big retraction. Another source of competition is the MLS, and in this article, it describes how it will be coming out with better ways to compete with Zillow. This might be a big threat, as Zillow does not seem to give its premiere agents exclusive listings and territories and it never publishes its agent turnover rate, so many agents may be leaving already after testing Zillow out. Lastly, Zillow's earnings are largely based upon growing the premiere agent subscriptions, so the main question you have to ask yourself, are agents going to need Zillow in a strong real estate market, or will they be able to make plenty of sales through word of mouth and a strong overall market action?Disclosure: I am short Z.

First it seems like Zillow is unsure of what the real marketing spend by realtors is. In the 2011 Zillow 10-K, management stated that the marketing spend by real estate agents was roughly 4.5 Billion, by saying that at 90 Million they were a little under 2% of market share. According to today's earnings transcript, Zillow's CEO Spencer Rascoff said that real estate agents make about 60 Billion on the high end in commission and spend 10-15% (he meant 17%) of it on marketing. This contradicts the 2011 real estate agent survey that was put out by ActiveRain.com, the largest professional network in the real estate industry. The following chart points out the disconnect between what real estate agents say they spend on marketing and what Zillow believes the market is:You can see the 6 to 10 Billion dollar estimate by Zillow is 1.5 to 5.5 Billion higher than what the Activerain.com survey predicts. This is somewhat concerning because a company that is trying to go after a market and decide how much resources to put into it, needs to know what the realistic market is.Another possible factor of the after-hour share decline might be due to slower year-over-year revenue growth. Although the full-year guidance was raised to 178-182 Million this year, a 54% increase over 2012, taking a look at this chart the year-over-year increases have been declining:Why I believe the stock dropped in after-hours trading was the fact that even given a ""growth stock"" label, due to the fact that it is growing the agent subscriptions at 83%, the stock price seems inflated. Taking a look at the following chart, even giving a 100 P/E to this stock, which is twice as much as the yearly revenue growth and above the agent subscription growth, the largest price that Zillow could be worth in 2015 should be $40 per share.The last area of concern for investors was likely to be the doubling in advertisement and an increase in costs across the board. Zillow management explained that it can have great margins today if the company did not make this investment for the future, but this will be the strategy for now. Although there may be a correlation between revenue growth and an increase in advertisement, this might be troubling to some investors because this correlation usually takes some time to confirm.To conclude the first-quarter recap, Zillow posted some great growth figures, but there is still cause for concern. Going forward it will try to prove the stock valuation to investors with continued high subscription rate increases, making new ventures like the Dig program profitable, forming new partnerships similar to the partnerships with AOL and Yahoo, and expanding internationally. But some investors might worry that it is growing spending too fast to try to propel its subscription growth even higher. Another cause for concern, which was only briefly mentioned on the call, is the growing competition from Trulia (TRLA) (which was upgraded based on its Q1 results ), ZipRealty (NASDAQ:ZIPR), Redfin (going public soon), Realogy (NYSE:RLGY) and the dozens of others in this market's landscape. So time will tell if it is successful in adding to one of its key metrics, earnings per share, but with the current growth rates and small margins I believe the stock is overvalued at $60 a share.Disclosure: I am short Z.

1393131,23407,2013-05-02T07:59:59-04:00,,"In February, I wrote how real estate agents were increasingly embracing services from Trulia (TRLA) and Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) in the wake of improving housing sales data.Both companies have been enjoying rapid display and subscription revenue growth -- a trend which continued in the first quarter, according to Trulia.A slate of bank settlements over Fannie Mae mortgages in January and February, including by home loan giant Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), reflect the banking industries growing enthusiasm over home loans. The action has cleared the way to normalized lending markets, which should help ease standards and drive loan volumes.Both Zillow and Trulia make the bulk of their money selling subscription services to real estate agents.Historically, the real estate market has proven hyper competitive with individual agents willing to embrace services to win clients. The rise in home sales has improved agents outlook, increasing their willingness to buy such services; in turn providing tailwinds for both Trulia and Zillow.In the first quarter, Trulia's sales almost doubled, increasing 97% to $24 million. The growth was nicely ahead of the $20.8-$21.2 million guidance issued by the company in its Q4 earnings release.During the quarter, 52% more unique visitors landed on Trulia's site with visitors increasingly engaging via mobile, where unique visitors grew 122% to 11.4 million.The company saw subscribers increase by 42%, or 3500 members, during the quarter.And, those subscribers were more engaged too as average revenue per subscribers climbed 46% to $187.The combination of more subscribers and higher revenue per member drove segment revenue to $17 million, 100% higher than last year.An improving market for housing related advertising boosted media revenue.In the quarter, Trulia was able to leverage higher visits and housing sales trends to land more advertising too. Sales in its media segment increased 91% to $6.6 million.The advertising strength should continue in Q2 as trends suggest increasing demand for real estate content.The first chart shows Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) search trends for Trulia, which continue to make new highs.The second chart shows Google trends for Zillow, which are similar and suggest positive Q1 earnings when the company reports on May 7th.Admittedly, all isn't rosy at Trulia.Despite the higher engagement, the company still couldn't translate sales growth into profits.But, losses continue to move in the right direction with quarterly earnings per share of -$0.02 a vast improvement from the -$0.54 loss the year before.Equally impressive, Trulia shares have moved up despite a 7 million follow on share offering in March, which raised $112.9 million for the company.Since the end of February, Trulia investors have seen share prices climb 35%. Returns at Zillow have been even better, with shares up 38% since February 28th.Importantly, those gains may not reflect all the opportunity in the two companies either. There are still more than three days of average volume to cover in Trulia and nearly nine days to cover in Zillow, suggesting additional good news for the two will support additional upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in Z, TRLA over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1413411,25120,2013-05-08T08:46:14-04:00,,"Shares of Trulia (TRLA) have already more than doubled in 2013 as the real estate search engine company is benefiting from the recovery in the U.S. housing market.On Wednesday before the market open, the company announced the acquisition of Market Leader (NASDAQ:LEDR) a provider of software-as-a-service customer relationship management software for the sector.The DealTrulia announced that it has agreed to acquire Market Leader, a software provider for the real estate agency, for $355 million. Shareholders in Market Leader stand to receive $6.00 per share in cash and 0.1553 shares of Trulia for every share the currently own. All in all the offer values Market Leader at $11.33 per share.Based on the closing prices on Monday, the deal represents an 18% premium for the company which already has seen its share price five-fold since 2010.Market Leader has been a leading company in the real estate industry helping agents to built personal reputations which should boost closings. By integrating with Market Leader, Trulia hopes to cross promote the offerings of both companies while leveraging complementary sales teams and processes.For the full year of 2012, Market Leader generated annual revenues of $45.0 million, up 32.3% on the year, thereby marking the second consecutive year in which annual revenues grew by more than 30%. The company reported net losses of $7.8 million, significantly down from the $14.2 million loss in the year before.The company holds $22.2 million in cash and equivalents and operates without the assumption of debt, for a solid net cash position. Operating assets are valued around $333 million, valuing Market Leader at 7.4 times 2012's annual revenues.The deal has already been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both companies. The transaction is furthermore subject to approval of a majority of Market Leader's shareholders as well as normal closing conditions, including regulatory approval. If all goes well, the deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year.ValuationTrulia ended its first quarter of 2013 with $214.3 million in cash and equivalents. The company operates with merely $9.9 million in short and long term debt, for a net cash position of roughly $204 million. The cash component of the deal stands at roughly $161 million. As such Trulia has sufficient liquidity to finance the deal.Trulia generated full year revenues of $68.1 million, up 77% on the year before. The company reported a net loss of $10.9 million compared to $6.2 million the year before. In the first quarter, Trulia actually experienced an acceleration of already high growth rates. Revenues rose some 97% to $24.0 million while net losses narrowed to $2.0 million.Based on Tuesday's closing price of $34.34 the market values Trulia at $950 million, valuing its operating assets around $750 million. This values the company at 11.0 times annual revenues.Trulia does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveShares of Trulia went public as recent as September of 2012. The offer price of $17 was set above the preliminary offering range of $14-$16 per share. Shares have seen decent opening day action ending the day around $24 per share.Shares have seen some weakness falling towards $15 per share in November before commencing on an impressive rally. Shares peaked around $35 in February, and after witnessing a bit of volatility, are settling around these levels.Investors are applauding the company's accelerating growth. Between 2009 and 2012 revenues almost seven-folded to $68.1 million as the company reported single million losses in each of those years. As growth rates are accelerating into the first quarter, the company is managing to reduce its operating losses.Investment ThesisIt will be interesting to see how investors will react to the proposed deal. The nature of the deal is of a highly strategic nature as the combination hopes to deliver superior services to prospective house buyers, sellers and real estate agents. Undoubtedly the deal will result in sales and organizational synergies, although the size of these have not been specified yet.Both companies are reporting modest losses, so best is to compare the valuations on revenue multiples. The deal values Market Leader at 7.4 times 2012's annual revenues, a sizable discount to Trulia's valuation at 11.0 times annual revenues. Yet Trulia has superior growth rates, as 2012's revenues grew 77% on the year compared to 32% for Market Leader.With an expected 31.7 million shares outstanding following completion of the deal, Trulia will have a market capitalization of $1.09 billion as the company operates with a net cash position of around $60 million. Operating assets are valued around $1.03 billion, valuing operations at 9.1 times 2012's annual revenues of $113 million.With some 46,000 premium subscribers the company hopes to outperform Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) in creating a premier nationwide home search engine with related services. By creating a market leader, the pair hopes to be optimally positioned to benefit from the housing recovery. The company will be able to offer superior desktop and mobile solutions.Back in September of last year, following the public offering of Trulia, I took a look at the company's prospects. At the time I concluded that shares are anything but cheap on a traditional valuation standpoint, yet the total valuation was only half a billion. Given the massive audience, prospects of good mobile user subscription growth, and strong overall visitor growth, shares might be rather cheap.Shares have risen some 50% from that point in time. Giving this nice strategic deal and the continued recovery in the housing market I reiterate my standpoint.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1329761,47401,2013-04-09T10:25:27-04:00,,"Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) on March 27, 2013 hosted an Investor and Analyst day. I went through the Investor and Analyst Day Conference transcript and found that I had some follow-up questions. I posed my questions to Katie Curnutte, director of communications at Zillow, and a company spokesperson. Below are my questions and her answers, for consideration. My questions are in bold.Following the interview is my analysis of the current investment opportunity that Zillow represents, looking at current valuation metrics and also taking into account the information gleaned from the investor day and my follow-up interview.Please take a few sentences to expound on the Zestimate, and why it is such a great tool.The Zestimate is a starting point that helps consumers determine the value of a home. Prior to Zillow, information about homes and home values was difficult or impossible to obtain. Zillow brought this information out into the open, along with information about recent sale prices and other data that can help consumers make smarter decisions about homes.Please comment on the Zillow database, about which Richard Barton, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman stated:This database is our competitive advantage. It is our competitive differentiator. It is what constitutes the moats around our business, and it is what serves as the connective tissue amongst all of the marketplaces that we're building, that you'll hear about.What specifically about the Zillow database gives Zillow an enduring, competitive advantage?We have information about 110 million homes across the country culled from public records, but also from users themselves. Users have edited information about homes more than 20 million times, resulting in a truly unique database that is impossible to replicate.Additionally, Zillow's relevance to consumers across all phases of the home lifecycle, from renting, to buying and selling, to financing and now, to home improvement, sets us apart from competitors.Richard Barton commented on the potential market opportunity for Zillow thusly:What are the 3 or 4 most critical things Zillow has to accomplish or execute to capture the majority of this TAM?At Zillow, we always innovate for the consumer. Thinking of consumers first and creating the best possible experience for them grows our traffic - we now have 50 million monthly unique users.We also operate the most popular suite of real estate mobile apps across all major platforms. And with real estate consumers accessing more and more information on a mobile device (more than 50% of our traffic now comes from mobile), our leadership in the mobile space sets us apart.Agents spend a percentage of their earned commissions on marketing and business services. We want them to spend those dollars on Zillow, and for this to happen we have to have a large and engaged audience of homebuyers, on the Web and on mobile.CEO Spencer Rascoff mentioned that Zillow has ""4 marketplaces: real estate, mortgages, rentals and home improvement."" What one thing does Zillow have to do or what is the biggest challenge in each marketplace that has to be overcome to most successfully grow the respective businesses?In all of the marketplaces, our biggest challenge is always to continue to innovate on behalf of the consumer and to grow traffic and usage. Our marketplaces are all in different stages: the Real Estate and Mortgages marketplaces are the most mature, with robust traffic and well-functioning monetization models. For our other, newer marketplaces (Rentals and Home Improvement), our goal is to build that traffic and then to figure out the most effective monetization models.There are 30,000 Premier Agents. There are somewhere on the order of 2.1 million licensed real estate agents in the US. Obviously there is a lot of room for growth here. What unique features of the Premier Agent platform will enable it to out-compete other ways for agents to acquire business and thus allow the Premier Agent program to sign up large numbers of agents over time?The biggest differentiator for Zillow is the millions of motivated homebuyers and sellers who use our site and mobile apps - by far the largest audience in our category. More than 50 million unique users visited Zillow on mobile and Web in March 2013. According to Experian, Zillow's mobile audience is more than double our nearest competitor. Additionally, Zillow powers Yahoo! Homes and HGTV's FrontDoor.com, giving Premier Agents exposure across an enormous real estate landscape.But we also offer tools and services to our Premier Agents that help them convert those leads into sales more efficiently. For example, Zillow offers free agent websites to Premier Agents and customer relationship management software (a CRM). That means Premier Agents have access to an enormous pool of potential clients, as well as the tools to help them better meet the needs of those clients.Obviously Zillow's stock price has had quite a run these past few months. Clearly the market has recognized that Zillow is executing in the early phases here. However, despite the run-up, please make the case for Zillow as a long-term buy right now ?We don't comment on stock price, but we are squarely focused on managing our business for the long-term. We're making decisions - like the decision to advertise and take advantage of the enormous brand whitespace ahead of us - for the long term. Zillow will be a brand that our children and grandchildren use.Can you estimate Zillow's revenue growth rate and net income growth rate annualized over the next 5 years?Based on the size of our opportunity relative to the current size of our revenue, we have a very long runway ahead of us.AnalysisZillow is an interesting way to play the housing boom. Zillow aims to be the go-to company for buyers, sellers, renters, home borrowers, and even people looking to remodel. As noted above, Zillow has launched business segments to address each of these areas. Zillow's quarterly execution was slightly above consensus expectations throughout 2012 on a revenue basis, and well above expectations on an earnings per share basis. Zillow's stock price has exploded recently, up 99.8% over the past three months. This begs the question: Is Zillow a buy, hold or sell today?Current Valuation (courtesy Yahoo! Finance)Clearly, on the basis of trailing P/E, Price/Sales, or Price/Book, Zillow is very expensive, and the current share price cannot be justified.However, as a rapidly growing company, one must consider using the metric of forward P/E. On this basis, if we assume a forward earnings and revenues growth rate of, say, 50% annualized, Zillow actually seems pretty fairly valued.An even more interesting way to look at Zillow, however, is one which Zillow executives suggested at Zillow's Investor and Analyst Day. That is to look at the enterprise value of Zillow versus the size of the market that Zillow is trying to address. As noted above, Zillow is trying to address multiple markets, but the market that Zillow Co-Founder and Executive Chairman Richard N. Barton chose to explore is U.S. real estate agent commission dollars. As noted above, he said:The biggest chunk of identifiable TAM for Zillow in the U.S. is actually the agent commission dollars. So the U.S., to scale, it's a relative scale, looks like this: $59 billion in agent commissions, and Zillow's enterprise value currently at $1.7 billion.Another way of looking at Zillow's market opportunity, as also noted above, is the fact that Zillow currently has 30,000 Premier agents, out of 2.1 million active agents in the USA.By the first metric, Zillow has achieved market cap/market size ratio of 2.88%. By the second metric, Premier Agents/total agents, Zillow has achieved penetration of only 1.43%.If Zillow can continue to grow revenues and profits rapidly and achieves market penetration of even 30% by either of these metrics, we can expect Zillow's market cap (and share price) to grow to perhaps 10 times what it is today. With 30% annualized growth rates, this could be achieved in 11 years.How does 10x your investment in 11 years sound?If Zillow can continue to execute over the long term, the current share price will prove to be very cheap. Of course, that's a big ""if"".Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in Z over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1346781,23908,2013-04-17T06:26:00-04:00,,"Trulia (NYSE: TRLA) has had a great year. The shares are up about 110% and counting. This performance beats the average index returns by about 100% and puts Trulia on the leader board of top-performing stocks.Though the ascent has been incredibly profitable for investors, more gains could be on the way for this housing stock. Trulia offers free housing data to consumers, and is a great investment if you're a believer in the housing recovery. Potential homebuyers use Trulia.com to access free data about price trends, neighborhood statistics and other important categories.The housing recovery looks to be maturing. Construction of new homes hit its highest rate since 2008, as starts for apartments surged in March, helping the total jump 47% from last year. That's the biggest percentage increase since 1992, according to HUD.This is especially great news for Trulia because developers will need to find people for those houses. Of course, Trulia is hoping that real estate agents will use Trulia.com to list properties and gain access to Trulia's 23 million monthly visitors.ChartWatch looked at Trulia before fourth-quarter earnings were announced in February. I expected the housing stock to find support at $23.50 (bottom blue line) and reach $30. However, even that optimistic expectation proved low. The shares quickly scooted to $38, notching a 65% rise in one week.Though the shares eventually topped near $38, the stock found support at $23.50 during its retreat, and proceeded to rise back above $30. The shares have since struggled to overcome $34 (top blue line). This has been an area of selling pressure, and it will take great first-quarter results for the stock to break out above it.Given the recent strings of amazing U.S. housing data, I'm inclined to believe Trulia will beat analyst estimates again this quarter. A high-volume breakout above $34 should result in a quick test of $38, followed by an eventual rise to $45. Trulia's top competitor, Zillow (NYSE: Z), is another great option, although we'll have to save analyzing it for another time. This chart shows the price of TRLA shares along with an important price channel to monitor.Disclosure: none."
1189691,30071,2013-02-16T12:11:58-05:00,,"Zillow, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) reported earnings on February 13th of 2 cents a share, down from 3 cents a year earlier but 2 cents higher than analysts had been predicting. Quarterly revenue increased 73% year-over-year to $34.3 million. Revenue for the year reached $116.9 million and the company expects revenue in 2013 to reach $165 to $170 million, an approximately a 43% increase over 2012. Traffic in the quarter increased 47% with more than 50% of those visitors coming from mobile devices. All the time I spend looking at the value of houses I drive pass and cannot afford appears to be really driving up traffic numbers. Zillow added 2,770 Premier Agent subscribers in the quarter brings total subscribers to 29,473 at year end, up 87% year-over-year. Furthermore, average monthly revenue per subscriber increased to $267 in the quarter compared to $258 a year ago. Zillow has three priorities for 2013. The first is to continue to grow the user base on mobile and desktop, the second is to grow the Premier Agent business and the third is to accelerate development of emerging marketplaces in mortgages, rentals and home improvement.Zillow believes it can be successful with the first goal through advertising and product development. The company believes that because most traffic comes to the site for free, advertising could significantly increase traffic and brand awareness. Furthermore Zillow recently announced an agreement with HGTV to become the exclusive provider of all real estate listings for HGTV's FrontDoor. With the second priority Zillow's current run-rate in the Premier Agent business is about $90 million which the company estimates is less than 2% of total spending on advertising by agents each year. Finally Zillow recently launched Zillow Digs, a home improvement marketplace that uses a unique algorithm to estimate local renovation costs.Zillow's closest competitor, Trulia, Inc. (TRLA) also reported earnings on the 13th, losing 3 cents per share on $20.6 million in revenue, a 76% increase year-over-year. Trulia also announced positive guidance for the first quarter of 2013. It now expects Q1 revenue of $20.8 to $21.2 million versus analyst estimates for $19.3 million. Both of these companies are high growth stocks focused on driving revenue growth rather than profitability at this point. Both companies have forward P/E ratios around 50 and Zillow has a PEG ratio of 2.94 versus 1.64 for Trulia. Zillow's advantages come with its larger size. Revenue over that past year at Zillow is almost double that of Trulia. Furthermore Zillow has a lower P/S ratio, 12.09 versus 14.07 and a lower EV/Revenue ratio, 10.43 versus 12.52.Zillow's chart shows how over extended the stock has become after the large move higher before and after earnings. There is a strong uptrend that has been in place since early November and you see that the earnings bounce has put the stock well above that trendline. Before considering a speculative investment in Zillow I would look for it to pull back to this trendline and the 20 DMA. If the stock holds around the $37.50 level it could be the start of another leg higher, possibility moving the stock above significant resistance in the $44 to $46 range.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1235381,23407,2013-02-28T16:34:37-05:00,,"As housing recovers, investors should keep a close eye on real estate web portals Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and Trulia (TRLA).The two companies are enjoying growth from both subscriptions sold to real estate agents and display ads.In January, I discussed the upside for real estate web portals, noting how Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) mortgage settlement suggests normalizing markets and a shift away from courtrooms and back to finding, lending and securitizing mortgages.The housing recovery is proving fertile ground for Zillow and Trulia.Last quarter, Zillow's display ad sales reached $7.5 million, up 22% from a year ago. More importantly, sales of subscriptions to real estate agents, which generate 75% of revenue, surged.In Q4, agents embracing premium web-based products lifted Zillow's subscription sales to $26.8 million, up 95% from last year. For the full year, an 87% increase in sales of Zillow's Premier Agent service helped Marketplace revenue increase 105% to $86.7 million. Combined with display ads, Zillow's total revenue grew 77% to $117 million in 2012.Trulia notched similar results, with sales hitting a record $20.6 million in the quarter, up 75% year over year. Revenue from Trulia subscribers increased 90% to $13.9 million and ad sales were up 51%.For the full year, Trulia's sales rose 77% to $68.1 million on a 104% increase in subscription sales.The interest in both companies doesn't appear to be waning.Subscription growth is rising sequentially too. Zillow's 87% year-over-year Premier Agent growth accelerated from 80% in Q3.And, 45% more people were subscribing to Trulia at the end of Q4 versus a year ago, an increase from the 34% growth registered in Q3.Additionally, Zillow's monthly unique active visitors grew 47% to 34.5 million in Q4. A trend which accelerated to 45.9 million active monthly users in January - a company record. At Trulia, monthly unique visitors were up 50% to 23.6 million in Q4.This acceleration appears to have carried over into February.The chart, from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Trends, shows Zillow is more actively searched than at any time in its history.What's perhaps more intriguing though is Q4 is historically the weakest time of year for both companies.So, as the home buying sales cycle shifts to the seasonally more active spring, investors should keep a close eye on both companies. Particularly, given short sellers are sitting on over 15 days of average volume short in Zillow and 13 days of average volume short in Trulia.Source: E.B.

1206091,23421,2013-02-20T09:09:07-05:00,,"A bubble for tech stocks is clearly back. The NASDAQ has more than regained everything that was given up in the Great Recession and at 3,213 it has returned to levels not seen since the year 2000.Companies that provide technology solutions within the real estate industry are currently getting a very positive double whammy in terms of share price. They are benefiting from a strong perception that the real estate market is recovering and they also get a clear bump up just for being technology stocks during a technology bubble.There is a noticeable amount of competition between publicly listed real estate technology stocks, including Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), Trulia (TRLA) and sites such as Move Inc. (NASDAQ:MOVE) and Yahoo (YHOO). In addition, industry leader Red Fin has announced its own intention to go public. As stated, ""Last month, Redfin announced that its listing business grew 120 percent in 2012 and the company plans to more than double its staff of listing agents this year to serve rising demand from its expanding customer base.""With many technology stocks, we have recently seen notable insider selling in the IPO, along with increased insider selling as soon as the lockup expires. In fact, it is now the case that management from certain companies have begun pushing for ""lockup lite,"" such that they can begin selling after just 90 days instead of 180 days, subject to a share price trigger.When Zillow came public at $20.00 per share, the shares quickly jumped to $44.00 before following a fairly steady downward path. It is almost 2 years later and Zillow is just now beginning to recover the value that it had achieved on its first day of enthusiastic trading. Zillow raised over $70 million in its IPO. In the 2 years since, insiders have now sold $128 million in stock. On the day of the lockup expiration, the shares tumbled 13%.The fact that management teams feel the urgency to cut short the lockup period and begin selling early certainly telegraphs the insiders' views about how sustainable the sharp spike in these shares will turn out to be. Why else would there be such urgency to shorten the lockup period by a mere 90 days?The use of these early lockup triggers is somewhat problematic. In some cases, it encourages the company to set its IPO price too low, such that even a moderate pop is enough to allow insiders to get out of their stock. In addition, the binomial nature of the trigger and the potential timing creates a very strong incentive for management teams to ""juice"" their results with channel stuffing, excess promotion, early revenue recognition or accounting gimmicks.With Trulia, we can see that the biggest surge in both users and revenues came just around the time of the IPO, although nothing appears to have been done improperly. Trulia certainly noticed the advantages of being able to sell stock early during a strong tech bull market, as was done by Zillow. Trulia basically copied the ""lockup lite"" provision from Zillow.The official stated lockup date is March 19th, so it is now the case that most investors seem to think that Trulia will be safe from insider selling for another 3 weeks. However, because it copied the Zillow language on the lockup, the shares may become sell-able roughly 2 weeks sooner than investors had planned.For the insiders, selling early makes perfect sense. Given that lockup dates are often associated with sharp drops in share price, the selling insiders of Trulia would be foolish to not sell at the earliest possible date, before the greater downward pressure hits the stock on March 19th. In short, ""lockup lite"" allows insiders to beat the officially stated rush to sell.This is all the more so given that Trulia is now sitting at lifetime highs of around $33 and recently hit a $1 billion market cap. Trulia has never had a profitable quarter, and its record 2012 revenues amounted to just $68 million. A wave of sell-side analyst upgrades resulted in an average target price for Trulia of $32.00, but the stock just has continued to soar past all targets. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)As shown above, the current share price is now well above the required trigger for selling before the lockup period ends. Prior to February 13th, sell-side analysts had targets on Trulia of $22-$28. All of the major analysts raised their target on Trulia into the range of $28-34. Yet Trulia has now jumped past all of those price targets and sits at around $33.00 after reaching a high of $38.22.As with tech bubbles in the past, when Wall Street needs to find a way to get bullish about money losing companies, Wall Street just changes the metrics and uses non-GAAP items such as ""Adjusted EBITDA"" and ""Adjusted Net Loss."" The measures basically allow a company to report all of the things that are beneficial in the short term, while ignoring items like interest, depreciation and the cost of stock options which still need to be factored in to the business. In effect, companies that report these numbers are saying, ""if you focus on all of the positives and ignore all of the negatives, then our company is doing quite well. Trulia's prospectus and earnings releases contain numerous warnings and caveats associated with these metrics while GAAP does not even recognize them.Management and insiders already sold $15 million of shares in the IPO. We can also see from the prospectus that insiders may have the option to sell prior to the March 19th lockup expiration, as a result of the share price exceeding $23.80 for 20/30 days.The total number of shares that become sellable at the lockup date is over 6 million, which constitutes over 22% of the total share count. There are ample reasons to expect substantial selling even before the final lockup expiration.By way of reference, on Tuesday, Trulia fell by more than 11% on volume of just 300,000 shares. The catalyst was a downgrade from Buy to Hold by Deutsche Bank.So even if the 6 million insider shares were sold over a period of numerous days, one would expect the share price correction to be significant.ValuationAlthough Trulia has made substantial progress in both financial and non-financial metrics, it is still the case that Trulia has never turned a profit.The latest surge in the stock, which added over $9.00 to the share price, was the result of Trulia simply getting to a level where it was almost breaking even. Judging by the current $892 million valuation, many investors are no doubt trying to predict a trajectory for Trulia's earnings. They are expecting a substantial jump into profitability within 1-2 quarters. Until that happens, we can see that Trulia is a phenomenally expensive stock vs. its peers.If Trulia can continue bringing in record growth even while further increasing prices, then the best result in 2013 is likely to be somewhere between breakeven and $1-2 million per quarter in earnings. So in any event, even if Trulia achieves massive success in 2013, the valuation vs. current market cap will end up being a P/E in the range of 100-200x which is likely not a sustainable valuation over the course of 2013.And in any event, a P/E of 100-200x certainly would provide adequate incentive and justification for insiders to sell as early as they can around the lockup.Business prospectsThere are several reasons why investors should not be banking of a seismic improvement in Trulia's financials. In other words, Trulia may not be able to lock in the record revenues that would be necessary to take the company from being a money loser into a profitable company in 2013.First, the current financial results have been achieved due to a large surge in subscribers even while Trulia raised its pricing to subscribers. This had mostly occurred as Trulia was coming public in its IPO and as the trigger-based lockup expiration was being calculated.Further gains of any similar magnitude would require yet another dramatic increase in the number of subscribers even as subscription rates would need to be further increased by a substantial amount.Second, the outcome of the lawsuit against Trulia by Zillow is still uncertain.A few years ago, Zillow created what it calls ""Zestimates"" as a way to obtain a vague estimate of the value of a home based on data from public filings. When Trulia launched a very similar service, Zillow sued. The outcome of the lawsuit is uncertain; however, even a quick glance at Trulia's website reveals numerous similarities to Zillow's patented Zestimates. Likely remedies could include financial penalties along with an inability to continue providing the service for Trulia.Third, order to justify the current $892 million valuation, the magnitude of the needed financial improvement is tremendous.Trulia's past financial performance is as follows:Assuming that costs will increase only half as fast as revenues, Trulia would have to achieve the following growth rates in order to provide the following valuations.As we can see, even if Trulia can double its revenue over the next year, it would still be trading on a P/E of 66x and a Price / Sales of 7x. Yet we can already see the law of diminishing returns kicking in as Trulia grows.In contrast to the scorching growth when Trulia was a small startup, QoQ growth looks set to dip into the single digits going forward. If this ends up being the case, then even if Trulia can start earning a profit, its P/E ratio will be well over 100x.Perhaps of greatest importance is that Trulia recently gave guidance that sequential revenues are set to increase by just 0-3% in Q1 2013. Quarterly revenue growth is shown as follows: (Click to enlarge)Instead of seeing even double-digit revenue growth, a much more likely scenario is that Trulia will show a more realistic level of growth, and the valuation will contract to more sensible levels. This growth pattern should be quite obvious to the insiders in Trulia who know the industry well. And as a result, there exists a very significant overhang risk as the 6 million shares under the lockup are now becoming free to trade.It should become clear that if Trulia shows some meaningful growth and can achieve profitability, then a justifiable valuation for the company likely falls between $18-$22.However, developments in the industry may keep Trulia from achieving the growth that it is hoping for and may impact its potential to become profitable in 2013-2014. Under such scenario, a price somewhere below $18.00 could become very justifiable for the market.Industry developmentsAccording to the WAV group, sites such as Zillow and Trulia have far less content than the MLS does. In addition, the content they have is substantially less accurate. Zillow and Trulia fail to list a significant portion of the houses that are available on the MLS.For the houses that they do list, the information is often inaccurate or outdated. For example, when a house has been sold or the price has been reduced, the MLS will reflect it almost immediately. Third party sites such as Zillow and Trulia often do not make such updates for as long as 1-2 weeks.A few months ago, Ben Caballero (founder and chairman of the National Association of Real Estate Professionals - NAREP) formed a non-profit group with the express purpose of combating the inaccurate listings posted on sites such as Zillow and Trulia.Trulia conducted its own study of inaccurate listings on its own site and concluded that it was less than 10%. However, a study by the WAV Group had revealed that a whopping 36% of the active listings on Trulia and Zillow were in fact no longer active at all, as reflected in the MLS databases. Mr. Caballero states:To the extent that Zillow and Trulia end up being forced to remove as many as one third of their listings, the impact will be felt both in terms of monthly visitors as well as in advertising revenue.In addition, it is now becoming the case that companies which provide the listings to Trulia and Zillow are beginning to cut them off or demand far greater restrictions on their use. For example, as of January 1st, Point2 Technologies (a listings syndicator) is giving control over the listing back to the brokers and placing substantial restrictions on their use by publishers such as Trulia and Zillow. As stated,On the rental side, Zillow and Trulia have increasingly been experiencing rental fraud postings. The issue is big enough that both have had to address it on their websites.Typically the poster will take an identical posting from a similar site, then make a few minor edits, while cutting the asking price by 30-40%. Such a price typically appears to be an exceptional bargain, and results in a large volume of calls from prospective renters. The scammers then try to get the interested party to send a small deposit check, or they try to get them to fill out a credit check application in an attempt to commit identity theft.The obvious solution to this problem is to perform greater verification. Some verification is currently performed, but obviously not enough to prevent fraudsters from abusing the system. The consequence of a greater supervisory effort would of course be the fact that many of the listings would be removed.ConclusionThe market is now going through a very visible bubble in technology stocks. The NASDAQ is now at levels not seen since the Big Bubble thirteen years ago. Tech stocks with an additional real estate focus are benefiting even more due to improved prospects for the real estate market going forward.However, the valuations which have been awarded to Zillow and Trulia are now so expensive that even phenomenal growth over the next 2 years would fail to put them at any type of sensible market valuation.In bull markets, investors and analysts often become quite complacent in terms of what they will pay and what they will accept. Investors are currently looking for excuses to buy, not to sell, as they chase the returns upward. Sell-side analysts are looking for excuses to raise price targets.The historical precedent of a 180-day lockup is now being waived on various occasions because the market is so strong that companies and their bankers can simply get away with pushing the envelope a bit further than in the past. However, many investors seem to be unaware of the stealth lockup releases based on share price triggers. The result is that when insiders start unloading stock, share prices will suffer.Trulia has 6 million shares which will be fully sellable in less than 3 weeks. By incorporating a triggered lockup release, insiders have already telegraphed their eagerness to sell into a strong market and their realization that time matters greatly in a bubble market.Even in the best case scenarios, a very high rate of growth will simply not justify the valuation that is already in effect. Meanwhile, various headwinds, such as the initiative by the NAREP chairman and Point2 Technologies to get inaccurate and outdated listings pulled from Zillow and Trulia, could potentially have a large impact on the sites' ability to attract viewers and achieve profits.Even at prices which are 25-35% below current levels, both Trulia and Zillow would still be required to post very strong growth in order to justify their valuations.Yet Trulia has given guidance of just 0-3% revenue growth in Q1.With Trulia, the near-term catalyst for a sharp drop in the share price will be the onset of insider selling as it pertains to the 6 million locked up shares. That lockup expires on March 19th; however, additional heavy selling could occur early as long as the share price remains above $23.80.Disclosure: I am short TRLA.

1048041,33311,2012-12-06T01:35:19-05:00,,"Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) is hotly debated in the real estate profession because some agents complain that it provides some inaccurate listings, while others perceive Zillow as forcing them to succumb to ""peer pressure"" to buy costly long-term contracts so that they can tap into the customer base on Zillow.Whatever the case may be, consumers are coming to the site and mobile app in droves. The rapid growth in traffic that Zillow is experiencing is a result of the large amount of information it provides consumers with, from historical price data, comparable sales data, mortgage payment estimators and tax information on every listing to dozens of photos of each property detailing the interior and exterior of homes.In the past, consumers had to deal directly with real estate agents and county clerks to get access to this information. Having access to this information online has been a big reason why so many people are coming to Zillow's website and mobile app. The main issue still seems to be that there are some listings which are inaccurate; however, if you have ever searched for a home using MLS listings, you would know that they too have those same issues with old listings, inaccurate pricing, etc.For real estate agents, the main issue at hand is whether or not they want to tap into the enormous base of customers visiting Zillow's website and apps and what price they're willing to pay for that access. Zillow now garners 36 million unique visitors per month. It has an extremely strong network effect: i.e., as more people come to the site, the greater the incentive is for agents to advertise their listings on the site and gain access to those home buyers and renters, and the greater the number of listings the more valuable it is for people coming to the site. It is now becoming an essential tool for people in the real estate industry because of the access they get to an enormous customer base.Below is a chart of the monthly unique visitors coming to Zillow from June 2011 to June 2012.Unique visitors grew from 20 million in June 2011 to 34 million in June 2012, an increase of 70% in one year. Since June 2012, unique visitors have grown an additional 2 million per month to 36 million.Zillow has long been focused primarily on the residential sale market and to a lesser extent the rental market; however, with its recent purchase of HotPads, the company will now have access to a much larger pool of rental properties that should attract more consumers to its site in search of rental properties.Revenue growth for Zillow has been extremely strong. Between 2009 and 2012, revenues grew about 550% from $17 million to an estimated $110 million. Revenues are estimated to grow an additional 45% in 2013. Earnings have grown from $(13) million in 2009 to an estimated $10.4 million in 2012. Earnings are estimated to grow roughly 60% in 2013 to $17 million.Based strictly on earnings, Zillow appears to be overvalued. It trades at roughly 85 times CY earnings. However, earnings are growing rapidly and the potential market size is extremely large. Real estate agents spend roughly $6 Billion annually on advertising, yet only about 1.5 to 2% of that will be spent on Zillow in 2012. It is estimated that about 2.0 to 2.5% of real estate agents are currently on Zillow.In Q3 the company added roughly 4,000 premier agents, a number greater than the 2,000 or so estimated by PAA Research, a boutique research firm known for its skepticism of companies in general. Opportunities exist in other areas like commercial real estate as well as mortgage origination / productivity products for Zillow to expand into and increase the relationship it has with consumers and agents on its site. It is notable that Citadel recently took a large stake in Zillow.Last week, Zillow closed its purchase of Mortech, which provides the following set of tools to the mortgage industry:This acquisition by Zillow should continue to strengthen the service offering it provides brokers with and increase the power of its network. Julian Hebron of The Basis Point recently wrote an article entitled ""Ignore Zillow at Your Own Risk,"" which covers the impact that Zillow is having on the real estate industry. To quote him, the purchases of Mortech and Buyfolio (another recent acquisition) are intended to ""suck realtors in deeper into the Zillow machine.""Looking at this from an investor's standpoint, it is easy to see why you might back away from the valuation. At about 45 to 50 times 2013 earnings, the stock isn't cheap. Yet, it is very hard to find another company growing as quickly as Zillow is with as big of an opportunity to grow as Zillow has. Typically, growth companies only give you a couple of chances to get in on a pullback. Zillow's stock is down almost 50% from highs 2 months ago on the back of soft revenue guidance due in large part to the loss of a large advertiser, Foreclosure.com. I would recommend using this opportunity to get into the stock.It should be noted that the relatively weak guidance was due to the company's decision to build out a platform of pre-foreclosed home inventory that put the company in direct competition with Foreclosure.com and forced it to pull its ads. The decision appears to be one where the company sacrificed short-term revenues so that it ultimately can build out a suite of services that makes its site an even more valuable tool for home buyers and real estate investors.Disclosure: I am long Z.

1423421,20568,2013-05-10T08:09:15-04:00,,"Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) Just reported a   gerat quarter, raised revenue guidance and noted that more than   half of its traffic is coming from mobile. As a   Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it   is the   Bull of the Day.Mobile TrafficThere is no doubt that the market is placing a premium on   companies that are more mobile based, as usage of smartphones   and tablets has exploded.  On the most recent earnings call the   company noted they are getting 55% of traffic from mobile devices   and even more on the weekend.The company also released a very telling stat.  93 homes were   viewed each second on mobile devices during 1Q13.  That is an   increase of 63% from the year ago period.  During 4Q12, that stat   was 53 homes per second which represented a year over year growth   rate of 47%.  So the pace of growth is increasing.Another segment that saw growth was the mortgage marketplace   revenue from mobile.  The last time this percentage was released   was 3Q12 and it was 20%.  The most recent quarter saw 31% of   revenues being generated from mobile for the mortgage   marketplace.Company DescriptionZillow operates of a real estate and home-related information   marketplace on mobile and the Web. It covers 110 million homes   and provides a ""Zestimate"" or a Zillow provided estimate for   homes, townhomes and condominiums.  The company has also expanded   into the rental industry.Z Beats Estimates In Three of Last Four QuartersDating back to the June 2012 quarter, Zillow has beaten the Zacks     Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters.  The June   2012 quarter saw the company post $0.04, $0.05 ahead of the   estimate for a 500% positive earnings surprise.  The following   quarter saw a six cent beat which translated into a 600%   positive earnings surprise.The most recent quarterly report took place on May seventh of   this year.  The company posted revenues of $39M and EPS of -  $0.11, a $0.01 miss on the bottom line, but a $3M beat on the   topline.Guiding Revenues HigherIn the earnings release and on the conference call, management noted  that they were raising revenue guidance from $165M-$170M to $178M-$182M  while consensus was just over $172M.  The increase was due to an  increase in advertising expense which drove more traffic to the website  in the quarter.  The downside of increased advertising expense is the  hit to the bottom line.During the quarter 46.6M unique users came to the site, up 46.7% from  31.7M users in the year ago period and up from 34.5M in the previous  quarter.  The result of the increased traffic was higher display  advertising revenues.  The company reported $7.9M in display revenue, up  27.4% from the year ago period and also posted a sequential increase  from the $7.5M from 4Q12.Conference Call Features Questions Tweeted InHistory was made when Zillow reported its most recent quarter.  For the  first time a public company took questions via Twitter,  huge win for  investors that want more transparency.  The real time nature of Twitter  allowed CEO Spencer Rascoff to address the idea of underwater mortgage  quote requests.  Unlike other calls that have tried emailed questions,  this approach allowed the casual observer to see all the different  questions and thought processes used in the analysis of the stock /  conference call / information.While there have been a few stories on the matter, many have missed the  idea of the real time nature of the Q&A.  Often times an analyst may  ask a three part question, but really have 6 queries. In this format,  anyone can put forth what is on their mind.  Of course the downside to  that is when someone is asking when the CFO might post something to his  Google+ account (like say, this article for example).  The other  potential downfall is the company selecting only the topics they want to  discuss.ValuationThe valuation picture for Z shows what you would expect to see   for a fast growing company with great potential for future   earnings.  That is code for a high valuation, as the company is   sporting a multiple thousand trailing multiple of earnings compared to a  20x industry average.  The price to book multiple of 6.7x is higher  than the industry average of 4.5x and the price to sales is just under  triple the industry average.  Those high metrics and multiples do,  however, come with a healthy dose of growth. Analysts expect revenue  growth of 52% in 2013 versus 10.4% for the industry and 39.4% for 2014  compared to 9.1% for the industry.The ChartWhen you see the chart of over the last six months you will see a 45  degree angle, which is just what most investors want to see. A big  driver behind that push higher has been consistent institutional  purchases, the least of which coming from Caledonia Investment  Management out of Australia.  I would note that any pull back over the  last six months represented an excellent buying opportunity.Disclosure: At time of publication, the author of this article owned shares of Zillow."
1030991,22762,2012-11-27T13:38:11-05:00,,"By   Frederic Lardinois Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) just announced that it has acquired the San Francisco-based rental and real estate search site HotPads for $16 million in cash. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2012. This acquisition marks the first time that Zillow has acquired a primarily consumer-facing company and Zillow says it is making this acquisition to ""expand the size of its growing rental audience and extend the reach of its marketing tools and productivity solutions for rental professionals.""HotPads has been around for a while. The company launched in 2005, with a focus on rentals. It expanded to include real estate sales in 2007 and started including vacation rentals and hotels in 2009. The company, which competes with the likes of Trulia, Apartments.com, Craigslist and, of course, Zillow itself, raised $2.3 million in a Series A round led by Meakem Becker Venture Capital in 2007, but hasn't raised any funding since. The company has 19 employees and will continue to operate from San Francisco and join the Zillow Rental Network once the acquisition has closed.The basic idea here, as Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff told me Monday, is to create one single database for rentals that will be available on Zillow, HotPads and the company's other properties. HotPads, he stressed, will continue to exist as its own brand and Zillow will commit additional engineering resources to help the company grow.HotPads, Zillow tells us, attracted about 2.8 million unique users in October. Nearly 70% of the listings these users looked at were apartments for rent. On Zillow, about 6 million users look at rentals each month according to the company's own data.Between Zillow Rentals and HotPads, Rascoff expects, the company can now offers a rentals marketplace at scale - something that wasn't previously available to users in the highly fragmented rentals market. For Zillow, this is also an opportunity to build a relationship with a younger audience - the kind that's shopping for a first rental apartment but not ready to buy yet. Once they get to the point where they are looking to buy, they will hopefully come back to the Zillow brand.""This acquisition represents a significant step-change for Zillow Rentals, allowing us to dramatically increase the number of leads we send to landlords. HotPads has a younger, complementary and rental-focused audience. Now Zillow will become even more relevant to consumers at the beginning of their real estate life cycle,"" said Spencer Rascoff, CEO of Zillow in a canned statement Monday. ""In addition, by acquiring an amazing engineering team, with a deep understanding of how people search for rentals and become tenants, we expect to accelerate our innovation and monetization of our rental marketplace.""Zillow, of course, has lately made a number of investments in the growing online retail market, including the recent launch of its free marketplace with tools for rental professionals that was largely based upon the company's June 2012 acquisition of rental relationship management service RentJuice. For Zillow, this is the sixth acquisition in the last two years. Just this month, the company announced its plans to buy mortgage technology company Mortech. In October, the company acquired Buyfolio and in June it acquired RentJuice. In 2011, it acquired Postlets and Diverse Solutions.Original post"

Sellers were sitting on nearly 11 days of average volume short, an amount equal to 116% of the shares available for trading, as of mid December.Simlarly, Zillow competitor Trulia, which IPO'd in September, also rallied more than 5%.As mortgage providers shake off regulatory chains, you can expect lenders will focus on qualifying, issuing and securitizing loans. As competition increases, credit standards will ease and spending on advertising will increase, boosting revenue at online real estate portals.But, advertising is only one driver of revenue at the Zillow and Trulia.Both generate the bulk of their sales selling services to real estate agents. And, with housing markets recovering more agents spending more money to attract more home buyers are likely drive those revenues higher too.Sales are already moving higher at the two companies.The combination of subscriptions and ad revenue growth boosted Zillow's Q3 sales by 67%. And, analysts are looking for Zillow's earnings to climb 58% in FY13 to $0.49.Zillow's monthly unique active visitors climbed to 36.1 million in Q3, up from 24.2 million the prior year.Real estate agents were also increasingly engaged, with 80% more signing up for Zillow's Premier Agent service, a subscription model accounting for 74% of the company's revenue. Ad revenue was up a healthy 15%.At Trulia, analysts expect the company to post its first full year profit in FY13, with earnings per share of $0.17.Trulia's monthly unique visitors rose to 23 million in the first 9 months of 2012, up from 14.5 million in the prior year. And, subscribers to Trulia's real estate agent service grew 34% in Q3 year-over-year to 22,763. Combined, the strength pushed Trulia revenue up 76%.With only 10 million and 13.7 million shares floating at Zillow and Trulia, respectively, any institutional buying could drive shares back toward 52 week highs.If investors are confident credit markets are going to get increasingly unlocked, it stands we'll see home sales continue higher in 2013.The higher activity should drive unique visitors to the companies web sites, supporting ad rates and click rates. It should also encourage agents to spend more on marketing, which would likely reward Zillow and Trulia shareholders.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in TRLA, Z over the next 72 hours.

It also operates Zillow Mortgage Marketplace, where borrowers connect with lenders to find loans and get mortgage rates.Zillow has a huge presence in the mobile app market. In addition to offering a scaled down version of its website on mobile apps, Zillow recently launched it's mobile app ""Rentals for iPhone."" The app offers iPhone users easy access to rental listings and data, making the process of rental shopping a tad easier. Zillow Rentals will even ping users when it spots rentals that match their selected criteria.Approximately 90% of Zillow's traffic comes from organic search (i.e., free unpaid for search results) and more than half of its visitors come directly to its site without a search, implying a significant amount of brand recognition. In 2010, Zillow signed an exclusive partnership with Yahoo whereby Zillow agreed to exclusively sell advertising to real estate agents and brokers on Yahoo Real Estate and Zillow would supply its for sale listings, as well as it's Zestimate (Zillow issued estimates on home values) to Yahoo Real Estate. This exclusive partnership was extended in April 2012.According to comScore the Yahoo!/Zillow Real Estate Network across, which Zillow sells advertising to their Premier Agents, is the largest real estate network on the web, twice the size of the nearest competing network or website.A few weeks ago Zillow introduced pre-market inventory to their search for the first time. This allows people to find detailed information on pre-foreclosures (i.e., homes where a Notice of Default has been issued and homes in foreclosed homes that banks gave up on but didn't put on the market). Zillow spent many months scrubbing the data and providing it in a user-friendly manner. These are homes that aren't listed on MLS or any brokerage websites and were only previously available to investors willing to dig through County Courthouse records or willing to pay fees to websites tailored to provide this information. This information is now available to its visitors for free. This will create a far more compelling product than competitors including Trulia (TRLA).Q3 results were spectacular, with revenue growing 67% year on year. The Zillow Marketplace division, which includes Premier Agent and Mortgage Marketplace, grew revenues 99% year on year. However, the stock has taken a nose dive in part because of fears about the loss of one of its largest advertisers, Foreclosure.com, and also in part because of a general market downturn.The loss of Foreclosure.com is due to the above mentioned launch of its foreclosure inventory feature. This resulted in negative revenue guidance for Q4. However, I believe this drop is temporary and the current weakness should be viewed as an opportunity to buy the stock. With a dominating market position in the online real estate listings market, and with impressive revenue growth, I believe Zillow is worth a good deal more than the 40 times earnings people are paying for the stock (based on 2013 estimates of $0.55 EPS). Below is a chart of revenue and gross profit growth over the past 3 years. In a market starved for growth, Zillow should be looked at closely.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in Z over the next 72 hours.

But this housing stock remains off many investors' radars.This is a great stock to own if you're a believer in the housing  recovery, which I am. Trulia offers free housing data to consumers.  Potential homebuyers can use Trulia.com to find free data about price  trends, neighborhoods, and other important research categories.In return for delivering such a useful service, the company receives  money from advertisements and real estate agents looking to drum up  business. Trulia charges real estate agents a monthly fee for receiving a  prominent placement in listings. The advertising business draws money  through display advertising, with fees paid on a per-impression or  per-click basis.The U.S. housing recovery is picking up steam. Moreover, mobile advertising is a huge industry. Trulia benefits from both hot trends.The chart above shows the price of TRLA shares, along with two important support levels to monitor. It's no wonder the stock popped in January. Volume was high during  the ascent, indicating extra-positive sentiment for the stock.Though the shares have rallied strongly, more gains appear likely.  After topping at $25.90, the stock stalled before moving on to higher  highs. This reprieve turned out to be a healthy consolidation, and  showed traders where to expect support on another pullback.Buyers should look for strong support near $23.50, which acted as  near-term support during this huge rally and was once a previous  resistance zone (top blue line above). There is another established  support region at $21 (bottom blue line above) should $23.50 fail. The  long-term trend favors TRLA, and I'm expecting the shares to reach $30."

It enables homeowners, buyers, sellers and renters to connect with real estate and mortgage professionals. The beauty of Zillow's business model is that as more buyers and sellers utilize the website, the easier it is for real estate and mortgage professionals to create relationships and therefore the higher the odds of selling a listing.The company makes money in a number of ways such as subscription fees from agents who wish to generate leads, commissions through brokering prospective clients with lending institutions and through traffic on its site by selling display ads and listings on its home page and side bar.Zillow has shown promising growth within the past five years. In Q32012, its revenues reached 102.4 million, an 83.7% increase from the corresponding period in 2011. Its operating profit margin increased to 6%, while its net income margin increased to 3% on a TTM basis. Zillow's monthly unique active visitors climbed to 36.1 million in Q3, up from 24.2 million the prior year. Real estate agents subscriptions also increased, with 80% more signing up for Zillow's Premier Agent service, a subscription model accounting for 74% of the company's revenue. Ad revenue increased up to 15%.Following Q3, the stock took a nosedive because of fears about the loss of one of its largest advertisers, Foreclosure.com. Since the downturn however, investors have realized the mispricing of Zillow and the stock has come back significantly. We believe Zillow has great potential growth going into earnings. Analyst expectations have also come down since Q3, which may make it easier to meet or beat in 2013.We see Zillow's launch of Zillow Digs as a growth catalyst going forward. Zillow in February launched Zillow Digs, an online platform geared toward remodeling homes. This service is similar to Pinterest in that users can post, share and organize pictures of homes, materials and remodeling products. Zillow has curated thousands of pictures to help give users remodeling ideas as well as help users with costs. Zillow CEO, Spencer Rascoff, has noted thatAccording to Rascoff, some 75% of homebuyers go on to remodel their homes. We feel this move by Zillow creates new growth markets. It is a disruptive innovation by the company and although it may take a few quarters to monetize the product, it will eventually bring new growth to the company.Zillow contiunes to offer a valuable service to homebuyers, sellers, real estate agents and mortgage proffesionals. As the real estate market begins to improve1, and as monetization of its product lines such as Zillow Digs begin to increase, we see strong growth for the company going into the future.Let's dive in to Zillow's profitability ratios:As you can see above, gross margins for Zillow were very strong compared with its industry and five-year average. Operating margins were a little lower than the industry average, but significantly better than its five-year average. The same can be said of its net profit margins of 6.16%. This is a significant improvement compared with its five-year average.The current ratio represents Zillow's assets to liabilty ratio. Zillow's 12.5 ratio is very strong compared with both the industry and sector. Within its industry Zillow is probably best compared with Trulia (TRLA). Trulia is another real estate website that utilizes a similar business model to Zillow. The company helps both buyers and sellers in finding and listing homes, while also providing real estate information. It is also a tool for real estate professionals to market their listings, view real estate data and promote their services.Trulia has also shown strong sales growth in the most recent quarter. In Q32012, its revenues reached 59.3 million, a 79.7% increase from the corresponding period in 2011. However its operating profit margin stood at -16.9% and its net income at -19.2% on a TTM basis.Let us now look at some valuation ratios. We will use Trulia as our relative company.Trulia had negative earnings in the most recent quarter so we could not calculate a Trailing P/E. However from a forward P/E perspective analysts are expecting Zillow to grow earnings and is significantly undervalued compared with Trulia. From a Price/Sales and EV/Revenue perspective both companies are relatively valued at the same price. We view these ratios as an advantage to Zillow. Although both Trulia and Zillow are valued similarly, Zillow's operating margins are much higher at 6% vs Trulia's operating margins of -16.9% TTM.Looking forward, Zillow's outlook for revenue for the fourth quarter of 2012 is expected to be in the range of $30.0 to $31.0 million. This represents 53% year-over-year growth over fourth-quarter 2011 revenue of $19.9 million. For the full year of 2012, revenue is expected to be $113.0 million. This represents 71% year-over-year growth over full year of 2011 revenue of $66.1 million.Using Zillow's forwarding-looking guidance for the next quarter and full year of 2012. We have estimated the following variables:10-year CAGR: Sales growth will grow steadily from 70%-80% averaging 75%.Capital expenses will grow at the same rate to sales.10-year operating margin: 6% steadily increasing to the industry average of 8%WACC: 12%-9% steadily decreasingEstimating these variables we come to an equity valuation of $42. This is about inline to above current analyst price targets. The mean analyst price target for Zillow is $38.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in Z over the next 72 hours.

This potential threat came from an organization that would, if successful, discontinue the syndication of all listings sent to sites like Trulia or Zillow; listings which are key for generating attention and mobile traffic to the sites. Both stocks have dropped significantly since, but for different reasons than the ones I pointed out. imagesZillow seems to have found a new outlet for growth and user attraction to their site. The company will, according to the Chicago Tribune, begin listing pre market inventory- which gives the site a unique edge against competitors. Amy Bohutinsky, Zillow's chief marketing officer, told the Chicago Tribune that:And this is a feature that will add uniqueness and staying power to Zillow's site that will generate the internet traffic they need to maintain and expand growth. Zillow will stand out to users, who will now be able to view foreclosures before they hit the market.Trulia, on the other hand, will most likely be stuck on the down spiraling path that they have been thrown onto, especially if they lose a majority of their syndicated websites to the NAREP (an organization that seeks to end all non-MLS real estate search sites). Zillow, however, will keep digging for features unique to their site that may eventually help them establish a nice moat.Conclusion:Valuation-wise Zillow has been priced with an overly extreme P/E ratio all year.After the stock's recent plunge, however, its P/E ratio has dropped significantly; and shares of Zillow are now trading at $25.20- closer around their 52 week low of $21.22. The company's revenue jumped 67% to a record $32 million at the end of its last quarter, with a net income of $2.3 million, according to Reuters. Some fear surrounding the company was also attributed to the loss of one of its largest advertisers, Foreclosure.com, which is another situation investors should consider, according to Reuters. Zillow currently looks like a spec play that could pay off in the future, but I would still be extremely cautious putting money into the company with its high valuations, while also paying extreme attention to its earnings going forward.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

981021,22762,2012-11-06T01:55:15-05:00,,"By Anthony HaReal estate site Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) just released its third-quarter earnings report, once again coming in just ahead of what Wall Street analysts had predicted. The company said it saw $31.9 million in revenue and earnings of 8 cents per share in the quarter ending September 30. That's up from revenue of $19.1 million and EPS of 2 cents during the same quarter last year.The revenue numbers break down to $23.6 million from the marketplace (which includes Premier Agent subscriptions), $8.3 million from display advertising.Analysts had estimated that the company would earn 7 cents per share on revenue of $31.66 million. Net income, meanwhile, was $2.3 million, up from a loss of $0.6 million during the same quarter last year.Also, as covered in a separate post, Zillow announced the acquisition of mortgage software company Mortech. Here's the statement from CEO Spencer Rascoff:More growth numbers: Zillow said it saw an average of 36.1 million unique visitors (across mobile and Web) during the quarter, an increase of 11.9 from last year. That includes a record high of 37 million in July.Back in September, the company announced that it would be selling additional stock in a follow-on offering.

994451,37881,2012-11-09T07:55:41-05:00,,"Over the last two months, Zillow (""Z"") stock has dropped by about 45%. It dropped ~20% in one day after its 3rd Q earnings release on November 5th.Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff appeared on CNBC and expressed his confusion over the major decline in the stock price post the earnings announcement and explained why he thinks the business is worth more today than it was last month; not less. The company beat Q3 revenue expectations, matched EPS expectations and managed to add 4,000 premier agent subscribers (a key driver of revenue).A fellow Seeking Alpha writer wrote a great overview on why he believes Zillow (""Z"") is a great purchase at these prices.Specifically he correctly points out that Q3 earnings will really positive:Since then the business case has only become more compelling as Julian Hebron on a housing blog wrote a great article entitled ""Ignore Zillow at Your Own Risk"" about how Zillow's business is only becoming more diverse and stronger.The bulls have made a strong case for the company but short sellers have continued to push the price down. Since February short interest has risen from 630 thousand shares to a whopping 7.6 million, one of the highest short percentages of float on the entire U.S. stock exchange!Citron Research published a hit piece on the company on September 25th outlining their dislike of the company. PAA Research published a great response to each of their points.PAA Research comes to the conclusion:Short sellers are able to pressure the market with aggressive selling thereby scaring shareholders into selling thinking that there must be something wrong with the company since the price is going down. I view this significant short interest as an advantage as you can now purchase the stock at a cheaper price and it also allows for a faster upward movement if positive news comes out and buying is sparked.The Zillow business case is still intact. The company was able to sell $156 million of stock at $43 a share a month ago to educated investors. If you believed in the story then, things have only gotten better and clarity on the execution of the business plan has only gotten clearer with the positive Q3 results.One should view the low market price as a gift from short sellers to allow one to purchase stock at a cheap level. If Zillow continues to outperform on the business case, short sellers will be forced to cover thereby driving up the price.It is essentially a game of poker here. The longs and shorts both have the same information available. The shorts appear to be the chip leader and are therefore able to control the betting. So far we've only seen the flop, but we still have two more cards to come. The bulls are holding pocket Aces and the flop has so far shown 3 unsuited, unpaired low cards. Don't let the chip leader bully your decision on whether to hold or fold by his decision to go all in.Zillow has a great business plan which they have managed to execute brilliantly to date. If you believed in the story 6 months ago or a year ago things have only improved. I recommend purchasing shares at this discounted level and ignore your gut which is telling you that the share price has gone down so there must be something wrong with the company. If Zillow beats earnings next quarter or some other positive catalyst comes along, shorts will be squeezed and should make the stock rise dramatically.As Zillow mentioned on their earnings call:Zillow currently only has ""a 2.3% penetration of U.S. real estate agents"" which means there is significant room for growth. As the real estate market continues to improve so should the companies earnings. Look to also see more of the offline advertising move to online in 2013.Disclosure: I am long Z.

1409341,48631,2013-05-07T13:18:53-04:00,,"The internet real estate sector is one of the most crowded sectors in the market place and it seems like every other month another real estate website pops up. One explanation for this surge in real estate websites is the low start up costs associated with pulling data from the national real estate databases and presenting it in a user friendly layout. This data gathering and layout on a street view is essentially all websites like Zillow provide to the real estate shopper. But if you want to invest in something innovative, a business with a technology that cannot be replicated and revolutionizes a sector, this brimming online real estate data sector might not be the best way to play the housing rebound.Zillow management and bulls claim that their current 90 Million in revenue from real estate agents represents less than 2% of the total yearly agent marketing spend. If that was true then there would be a lot of room to grow for Zillow and its dozens of competitors, but looking at some figures this market quickly shrinks. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) puts their current memberships near 1 Million on their website. Also according to the NAR's website the independent contractors total 81%, who are most likely the main users of online marketing tools to reach customers. The other 19% work for firms who have their own roads to market and marketing tools. Another fact that shrinks the agent market can be seen in the following video by RE/Max that says only 27% of real estate agents are full time. Next we take into account the monthly spend of Real Estate Agents on online marketing. The data by Activerain.com puts monthly marketing spend per agent at $664, which in all probability is that high only for the elite agents, but this is a very conservative model for the Zillow bulls, so we will leave it at that. So extending the monthly spend to a yearly spend we arrive at $7,968 per year. Per Zillow's 10-K they generated 90 Million from agents and claim that it's less than 2% of the spend out there, which would equate to about a 4.5 Billion market. Bringing us to the following chart, which shows a conservative estimate and a Zillow estimate. The conservative estimate seems more realistic because it limits the market to only half of the yearly spend on services like Zillow offers (agents don't put all of their eggs in one basket that is why the Activerain.com .pdf shows the many different marketing tools they use). It also assumes part time real estate agents spend half the amount full time agents spend, which might even be overstating their spend since part time agents include people with full time jobs and who do real estate part time for family and friends or on referrals.So using the entire budget as an estimate (all eggs in one basket estimate) the results still come in at around a 4.1 Billion market (the market spend data is from 2011 so let's assume a large 10% spending increase and we arrive at 4.5 Billion). A betting man would venture to say that the part time agents spend next to nothing on advertisements and just rely on word of mouth and repeat business, but we will remain ultra conservative in these models. Thus the conservative estimate with yearly spending growth factored should be somewhere around 870 Million, which is only 19% of the Zillow estimate.That being said that brings us to our next model, based upon a statistic in the Activerain.com marketing data, which says 42% of business comes to agents from referrals, past clients and personal websites. So we now co me to the realistic model, taking away this 42% who are doing just fine on referrals and past clients, that leaves roughly 58% of agents needing outside tools to generate business. Also using Zillow's 10-K, and my conservative model of the potential available agent revenue of 2.3 Billion, their year over year growth was only 0.2% of the available 2.3 Billion market. This is seen by them growing agent revenue of 42Million in 2011 to 86 Million in 2012. Thus they currently represent 3.7% of the total 2.3 Billion market and say they keep doubling that growth rate for the next three years, we come to the next three yearly growth rates of 0.4%, 0.8% and then 1.6% (ending at 6.5% of the market in 2015).This is a more realistic model because the street might soon figure out that the market for agent revenue is 25-50% of what was originally claimed and even with a very high and unlikely (due to competition) growth rate of 26% for their online web traffic revenue, their 2015 projected EPS would still be at $0.20. That represents a growth rate of only 11% from 2012 to 2015, or 3.67% yearly EPS growth. Of course Zillow has realized this and is now looking for additional revenue streams via partnerships, mobile expansion and their controversial Digs service. Thus even if all of these new ventures add some EPS (they can easily cost them EPS as well), it would still not be enough to justify where the company is priced today. I have included the price targets based on the different P/E ratios. The P/E of 25 is in green because it is more likely for a company that is slowing down in growth and becoming an established company.Next the bull case must be represented as well. Zillow claims there is a 4.5 Billion yearly marketing spend by agents that they can go after and they currently have 86 Million of it. The 86 Million equates to 1.9% of their total market and they grew it from 2011 to 2012 by 1% of the total market. So let's keep doubling their growth in their model and let's throw out an insane number and say they grow 88M, then double to 176M and then double again to 352M in 2015, which equates to 3.86% of the market in 2013,7.8% in '14 and 15.6% in '15. Using these extreme growth models, which will likely never happen with the amount of competition in this sector, the 2015 EPS should be $0.71. This represents an 18% yearly growth from the current EPS of $0.18. The reason I point this out is that currently the P/E of Zillow is 339 due to the market giving the company a ""growth"" label. This growth label is usually reserved for startups with a unique technology that yields astronomical growth or an innovative process that offers a company a unique foothold on their industry. Zillow might have had this when they first started, but with the influx of competition and a limited market, the growth rate will fall too below 20% even on the most aggressive models like the one below:A couple of other troubling things to watch out for in the future are pointed out in the following Inman.com article. The article states that although the agent subscriber rate is up, Zillow refuses to publish the churn or turnover rate. This hides the turnover rate and makes it hard to say if the agents are sticking around from the benefits of Zillow or trying it out and not finding a lot of value in it. One possible reason they are hiding this rate is the accuracy of their stats turning a lot of agents away. According to this ZipRealty report, ""16% of the home listings shown on Zillow's website were not listed by the corresponding MLS to be for sale at the time of their display on the Zillow website."" ZipRealty also claims they list properties 92 days faster on average than Zillow, which would frustrate any agent who likes current housing listings. Another worrisome fact from the Inman.com article is that Zillow is doubling their advertising budget, thus the growth is spurred on by this aggressive marketing spend, which is helps to explain why their profit margins are at a low 5%. If they try to let up on the advertising to get their margins up, what will that do to website traffic and agent subscriptions? Given these two worrisome facts and with competition on the rise, it might be hard for them to meet their growth targets and get their P/E ratio under 100, which investors are looking for.One of the last things to always look at are the past few quarterly results as well as key financial data of the companies in this sector.Zillow (NASDAQ:Z)*all revenue / income numbers in thousandsTrulia (TRLA)*all revenue / income numbers in thousandszipRealty (NASDAQ:ZIPR)*all revenue / income numbers in thousandsMove Inc (NASDAQ:MOVE)*all revenue / income numbers in thousandsRealogy (NYSE:RLGY)*all revenue / income numbers in thousandsOne thing all of these stocks have in common is that their 2013 and 2014 growth projections, compared to their current share price, still pegs them at a P/E ratio between 25 and 100. Thus extending my Zillow models, the entire industry is still overpriced and should be adjusted for growth rates under 20%. Since all of these stocks offer very similar products, it seems like they are all being artificially lifted by everyone trying to play the housing rebound somehow. Look at all of their last several quarters, the revenue for these companies has been either declining, flat or growing slowly. The cost of revenue for most of the companies has been increasing as well and the net income has been abysmal, further strengthening the bear case on this sector. One explanation of the unimpressive results is that more and more competitors are vying for the limited amount of real estate agents as well as web site traffic. Lastly, a lot of them have debt, low cash flows, low cash on hand and low earnings per share, thus it will be hard for any of them to distinguish themselves from the pack with such small amounts of cash on hand without issuing a lot more new shares and diluting their share value.The run up in share price for Zillow and this sector as a whole seems to be largely based on the hope that real estate will be back to the extraordinary levels before the collapse in 2007. But we now know that with a lot more rules and regulations in the industry and with the investment banks being restricted from making wild bets on highly leveraged low rated loans, the real estate industry will likely not be back to 2007 levels anytime soon. We also know that the Fed has helped to artificially prop up the economy by printing records amount of new money through a process called economic easing. On top of this fact, the record low interest rates are fueling big banks and investment firms to buy up property. So in about a year when the Fed plans to stop economic easing, the rates should go back up and when the investment firms turn around to try to sell their properties, how will the real estate market look then?One of the last things to analyze before concluding is the competition and possible future competition. I have listed just several of the leading companies in this article, but there are a lot more including Redfin (planning to go public in 2014), Movoto, Craigslist, Coldwell Banker, RE/Max, etc. The competition is so great and vast, it is very hard to distinguish oneself from the dozens of other companies who offer virtually the same products and services. Not to mention that major internet companies who employ a lot of programmers (remember that most of these sites mainly run on data gathering, programming to display that data and a sales department) like Yahoo (YHOO), Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) can come into this market space at any time. One company that could essentially cripple most of these internet real estate database sites is Google. The companies analyzed in this article live off of their websites being on the first page on the Google search engine. If Google wanted to combine its powerful Google Maps and Google Earth products to offer a way for a user to browse a 3D neighborhood and to see what properties are available to purchase, it would not have to go through a lot of its 50 Billion in cash to make it happen. They would also promote their product and any properties searched on Google would have their Google real estate product as the first hits on the results page. So analyzing the amount of competition and realizing that major web companies can enter at anytime, should caution anyone thinking of buying a share of a real estate search engine stock with a high P/E ratio. With this in mind, the safest bet if someone really wants to enter this market segment might be to invest in one of the lower forward P/E companies, like Move Inc., Realogy or ZipRealty.In summary, the current price per earnings and share price of Zillow and its competitors are in the stratosphere. They can only be explained by investors playing the possible real estate bounce back aimlessly or playing a possible short squeeze on small market cap companies. Zillow's 2013 and 2014 projections, while appearing to be large percentage increases on paper due to bouncing back from low gross incomes, will still yield very low earnings per share and possible slow growth. The price per earnings ratio will still be high going forward, much higher than the Dow and S&P components, thus you must ask yourself what are you really paying for? The volume traded on these stocks is very low and some would consider these very speculative and extremely risky. A cautious investor would wait 3 to 4 quarters of positive revenue growth above 20% and solid margin growth. If that happens, and that is a big if, I would still never buy a share of a company with a P/E ratio above 40 in this sector. This sector is very susceptible to the economy, has little to no unique or proprietary technology and is one of the most competitive sectors tied to a volatile and uncertain real estate industry.Disclosure: I am short Z.

Real estate search engine and Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) competitor, Trulia (TRLA) went public in September, debuting at $22.10 per share (up 30 percent from its initial pricing) with a valuation around $580 million.Wednesday, Trulia announced its third quarter earnings - its first report as a public company. While results were mixed overall, the company still managed to give shareholders a few reasons to be optimistic.For starters, the real estate marketplace saw revenue increase by 76 percent year-over-year to $18.5 million, which outpaced Wall Street's average forecast of $17 million. Trulia posted a net loss of $1.7 million for the quarter, compared to $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2011, however, adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was $300K, a $700K increase year-over-year, which represents the company's first-ever quarter of positive EBITDA.""In our first quarter as a public company, Trulia delivered record traffic and record revenue contributing to the company's first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA,"" Trulia CEO Pete Flint said in a statement today.

981351,24849,2012-11-06T03:56:37-05:00,,"On Monday afternoon, Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), the leading real estate information marketplace, reported record third quarter earnings. The company reported revenues that were slightly ahead of expectations and earnings per share that met estimates. Overall, the numbers looked pretty good. However, a slight change in the overall business strategy going forward led to lower than expected guidance. This guidance sent shares plunging lower by 22% in the after-hours session. In this article, I'll show you why I think the drop was a complete overreaction, and why I bought some shares on the dip.Third Quarter Results:For the quarter, Zillow reported record third quarter revenues of $31.915 million, which beat analyst estimates of $31.66 million. On an earnings per share front, the company reported a profit of 7 cents per share, matching expectations. In the year ago period, Zillow reported revenues of $19.057 million, and a 2 cent per share loss.Key Growth Drivers:In this section, I'll show some key metrics that are improving greatly over the prior year periods. The following images were taken from the company's Q3 report, and the first one shows unique users and premier agent subscribers, key numbers for the company's growth.These numbers represent strong growth, and definitely help explain why revenues were up almost 67.5% over the year ago period. Now it is great to expand your user base, but it is even better if you can make money off them. The next metric I'll show is average monthly revenue per subscriber. As you can see, Zillow's average revenues per user rose $7 over the Q2 period of this year, and $28 over the year ago period.Margin analysis:The following table shows Zillow's Q3 margins over the past few years, and also shows this year's Q2 margins. As you can see, margins are expanding nicely, and I'll explain why after this table.In terms of gross margins, I only subtract out the cost of revenues, which does not include what Zillow describes as ""amortization of website development costs and intangible assets included in technology and development."" Either way, those expenses are included in operating expenses, so if you'd rather look at that margin level, it is increasing even faster than gross margins.So how did these numbers come to be? Well, as I explained before, Zillow's revenues increased by 67.47% over the prior year. However, the cost of revenues was only up 17.48%. As such, gross margin dollars increased by 77.12%. You can see that above where gross margins increased by 483 basis points.Sales and marketing expenses more than doubled in the period, up 100.68%. Technology and development expenses rose by 73.73%. However, general and administrative expenses declined by 8.83%. Overall, these three operating expense categories rose by 56.81%. Since that was not as fast as the rise in gross margin dollars or revenues, operating margins increased, and quite substantially. While the company reported an operating loss of $606,000 in last year's period, it reported an operating profit of nearly $2.3 million in this year's Q3. Operating margins rose by 1037 basis points. A slight rise in other income also occurred, but at a slow rate, thus, net margins only rose by 1030 basis points. But that's still quite a jump, and the company did swing from a loss to a profit.Balance sheet / money raised:The following table shows how Zillow's balance sheet has changed in recent periods. The numbers look kinda funny, and I'll explain that in detail in just a bit for those that don't know why this is. Dollar values below are in thousands.Now, the numbers look too good to be true with a huge improvement in Q3. Well, the company raised some money in the quarter, and yes, a partial exercise did occur where underwriters bought more shares. Zillow's net proceeds were $156.7 million, and it sold that stock at $43. We are now at just $27. More on that later. Selling shares is seen as a negative, because existing shareholders are diluted and some believe that a company is signaling that it is overvalued. But remember, if the company sold those shares at $43, there had to be someone that bought them at $43.But even if you want to take out that money raised, the balance sheet still improved. I subtracted the $156.7 million from cash, current assets, total assets, and total equity. The adjusted cash and investments pile would have been over $72 million and working capital of about $64.8 million. The current ratio would have been 4.37 and the debt (liabilities to assets) ratio would have been 15.67%. Those numbers are all improvements over Q2.It is that large cash position and great financial flexibility that will allow this company to expand and grow in the following years. That process has already started, and Zillow announced the following acquisition along with its third quarter results.Fourth quarter / full year guidance:This appears to be the reason why shares fell so much in the extended hours session. Zillow guided to fourth quarter revenues of $30 million to $31 million, while analysts were expecting about $32.54 million. Also, adjusted EBITDA guidance was $3 million to $3.5 million, which would be down from Q3's $7.6 million. The forecast means Q4 adjusted EBITDA would be 11% of revenue, compared to 17% of revenue and $3.3 million in Q4 of 2011.Still, the Q4 forecast implies 53% revenue growth at the midpoint. Full year revenues would be $113 million based on the Q4 midpoint, representing 71% year over year growth, but analysts were looking for $114.76 million. So a little below expectations.Now, the first thing I want to show you is the company's previous quarterly guidance. The table below shows the company's given guidance, compared against what it has actually done.So the company has beaten its guidance nicely in the first three quarters of this year. While expectations do call for $32.54 million in Q4, it is likely that it will come in closer to expectations that some may have thought when they originally saw this guidance.But why the low guidance? Well, it has to do with a shift in the company's business plan going forward, and analysts didn't seem ready for this. A good article from Business Insider explains why the forecast may have been lower than expected. Here are a few key points, taken word from word from the article, so I'm not stretching the argument.So Zillow is changing its business strategy, and the author of the article states that analysts didn't seem ready for the change, and were upset that they didn't get a heads up. These changes seem like a short term negative, but they probably are a long-term positive.Growth / Valuation:Zillow is growing at a nice pace, and the valuation after the fall seems extremely attractive in my opinion. That's why I bought some.So the following table shows some key growth and valuation numbers for Zillow. I've compared them against Trulia (TRLA), another real estate site in this space. I also put Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and LinkedIn (LNKD) into the discussion, because all of these names have gone public in the recent social media craze, and those are the two largest names.Now a few notes on the numbers below. First, I have used the last price in the after hours session and corresponding market cap for Zillow and Trulia, since both showed significant declines after the bell. Second, I have adjusted Zillow's growth forecast for the new guidance, using 2012 full year midpoint guidance. For 2013, I have taken down the current analyst estimate by the same percentage that the 2012 midpoint was below the current 2012 analyst estimates (slightly more than 1%). For Zillow's earnings, I have used the current estimates, which could come down a little based on the EBITDA forecast. For all other names, current guidance is given.*Trulia recently went public, so there is not a full estimates page for the company yet. Also, Trulia is expecting a loss in 2012 and a profit in 2013, so the growth numbers in EPS are not meaningful for those two years. Additionally, there is no P/E for 2012 based on the loss.On a price to sales basis, Zillow's valuation looks extremely attractive, and it is growing almost as fast as LinkedIn, and much faster than Facebook. On an earnings per share front, the stock looks very cheap, especially given the projected earnings growth. I'm not arguing here that Zillow should trade for 160 times 2013 earnings like Trulia is. But even if you say the company is worth 60 times 2013 earnings, and it earns say $0.65 (current expectation is for $0.68), the stock would be worth $39.00. That's well above where we are currently, and I'm not even using a crazy valuation like some of the other P/E values other names are trading at.Conclusion - why I bought:In full disclosure, I did buy some shares of Zillow in Monday's extended hours session, although not all of my order was filled.But why did I buy? Because I don't think the results after the bell justified a 22% fall, in addition to the 5.3% drop in the regular session, plus the fact we were already down a bit in recent weeks. Going into the earnings report, Zillow was already trading 20% below where the company sold stock at. The company declined after the offering, and yes, shareholders were diluted.But when you combine the 20% fall with the more than $7 drop in the extended hours session, shares are now 37% below where the company sold stock. I don't see how the numbers justify a 37% drop. Guidance wasn't terrible. It was a little less than expected, but the company does give conservative guidance, and we saw a good explanation of why the guidance might have been lower than expected.The company also has a fair amount of growth potential, and trades at a very reasonable valuation to other names in the space. Now I'm not arguing that this name should definitely trade at valuations like those other ones, which would value this stock at like $60-$80. The average analyst price target going into this report was over $45. I think the fall was a bit much, and I would have thought that $30 to $32 after this report was fair, not $27. Zillow fell too much in my opinion, and I think that there is an opportunity for investors here. Should we rebound to over $30 in the next few days, I'll re-evaluate my position then based on where analyst expectations end up, but for now, I'm long.Disclosure: I am long Z.

897541,35211,2012-10-01T12:49:52-04:00,,"Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) may be the most resilient social media stock in the entire industry. It is a company with the most loyal of investors, who won't sell regardless of its apparently overvalued price tag or the excessive negativity surrounding the company as of late. The stock has performed well and doubled from its IPO price in less than a year. But with its greatest strengths being its greatest weaknesses, investors must wonder if its run can continue.On Tuesday, shares of Zillow fell by nearly 7% due to a negative outlook by well-known analyst/short-seller, Andrew Left, of Citron Research. The title of the research report sums up the topic of the piece, ""Zillow: It's Not Just the Ridiculous Valuation - it's the Ridiculous Business Model."" Normally, I am not too fond of Citron Research for its preference to write negative articles on stocks that are overbought, which are, therefore, stocks that can be easily manipulated. However, the report from Citron was among the most detailed analysis that I've seen for a social media stock, and I urge all to read the report by clicking here.As a result of the companies that Citron typically covers, the mere mention of analysis from the firm usually leads to a large loss for a stock, minimum of 10%. Yet with Zillow, its loss was less than 7%! Also, keep in mind this 7% loss was also due to the fact that all social media/internet-based companies were trading lower on Tuesday due to strong selling in the market. So if the market had been trading higher, it's possible that Zillow's loss would've been even less. Then, when you incorporate the company's recent secondary public offering earlier this month, it is easy to suggest that shares of the company should be trading significantly lower for the month of September.There are two key factors to consider when assessing the performance of Zillow in the month of September: its secondary offering of 3.18 million shares in the first week of the month and the bearish outlook from Citron Research on Tuesday. Despite these two stock-crushing events, the company has maintained its valuation! It began the month at $41.00, and on Tuesday it closed at $41.45. To better explain just how extraordinary this performance is, let's rewind and consider the market influence of Citron Research. We already know that anytime a company does a secondary offering, or any type of financing, it pushes shares lower. But Citron is, perhaps, more damaging than a secondary offering, and has a long history of bearish articles that push stocks lower. The firm's most recent articles have led to losses of more than 10% in shares of Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) and Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS), along with a loss of more than 20% in shares of Quesctor Pharmaceuticals (QCOR). However, in terms of valuation, none of these stocks were as expensive as Z in relation to fundamentals, thus making its loss of only 7% very surprising.Considering the valuation of Zillow, its performance is remarkable. Its valuation suggests that this small company has found the cure to cancer or has the next iPhone, but in reality it's just a real estate information website. The bull's case for the future of this company is based on three key elements: fundamental growth, premier agent subscriber growth, and average monthly user growth. Over the last year Zillow has grown at a tremendous rate. In its last quarter the company announced revenue of $27.77 million or 75% growth year-over-year. It also announced 70% growth in premier agent subscribers with 22,696 and a 61% increase with 33.5 million average monthly users.Now, here's where common sense must come into play for investors of a real estate company: If Zillow has 110 million U.S. homes on its database, 22,696 premier agent subscribers, and this combination amounts to revenue of under $90 million for the last 12 months, then what is the upside potential for this company and its stock? How long can it maintain this growth and what's the ceiling? Granted, real estate is a large industry, but with 22,696 agents, the company is already profiting from a large share of its addressable market. The company trades with a price/sales ratio of 14.53 and a forward P/E ratio of 58.38, so can the company really grow to a level in which fundamentals could come close to validating its stock metrics? Unfortunately, I don't think so. Zillow is a real estate information marketplace, and already has virtually all houses on its website that are for sale, and a large chunk of real estate agents who pay for Zillow's services. In addition it shares this space with competitor Trulia (TRLA), and no one knows for certain if agents will be willing to pay for Zillow services if real estate demand continues to rise.The bottom line: There are too many questions, not enough answers, and a limited market for growth with the company's current business model. It will most likely never grow and materialize to be deserving of a $1.2 billion market cap. However, with that being said, there are companies with far worse fundamentals valued at over a billion in this new era of dotcom companies. Zillow does have a legitimate, profitable business model; I am not suggesting that it will experience the same fate as the dotcom era of the past. Eventually fundamentals and valuation begin to close the gap once the hype dies down. Ergo, despite the fact that Zillow investors are a loyal bunch, the stock does look to be near the top of its range, and could very well experience the ""single digit fate"" detailed in the Citron Research report… and at that point, shares of Zillow may be attractive.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

886901,32101,2012-09-25T07:29:10-04:00,,"Incorporated in 2004, Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) is a real estate ""information marketplace,"" which operates a website and corresponding mobile applications. It operates ""the most popular suite of mobile real estate applications across all major platforms"" -- which is to say that it is more popular than Trulia (TRLA), a company that IPO'd last Thursday (I have previously written about Trulia here). During 2011, 100 million homes were viewed through Zillow.Following its IPO in July 2011, its shares have held their high price and increased. Zillow looks as if it is least 9 months ahead on the unique visitor curve when compared to its rival Trulia. By other quantitative metrics, Zillow is mostly ahead of Trulia -- by a decent margin. By that I mean (1) it is making a profit with free-cash-flow [1], (2) it has higher revenues, (3) more unique visitors and (4) more services in general. See Zillow's operating statistics (you will need to click to expand):As of last quarter, Zillow has reached 33.5 million average monthly unique users, as compared to 22 million for Trulia.RevenuePreviously, Zillow made most of its money through click-based advertising. Now, Zillow has followed Trulia (it seems) with the subscription based model. You can see the changeover within segment revenue below:(Source: Zillow 2011 10-K, p. 39)And, one can see the same progression more clearly if you include 2009:(Source: Zillow 2011 10-K, p. 76)And, while you get the picture, here is the swap in importance when seen as a percent of revenue:(Source: Zillow 2011 10-K, p. 40)This changeover was also helped along by beginning to charge lenders for participating in the Mortgage Market Place (more on that below).Branding And Marketing And Fuzzy FeelingsCEO Spencer Rascoff noted that the S-1 is a document which has to at once be a legal document, an accounting document, and a marketing document. With that in mind, when one reads about Zillow's business and compares it with Trulia, one gets the impression that Zillow is far more consumer and product focused than Trulia. And remember, the saying ""customer is #1"" isn't just for marketing -- it frequently dictates whom the customer chooses. In this world where the consumer is sovereign, Zillow's focus appears better managed.In addition, Zillow seem to have a better grasp on the importance of its brand. For instance, Zillow has made a point to become the ""go-to"" source for information about the housing industry. A quick Bloomberg news search shows that half the mentions of the company Zillow don't have to do with the company itself, but with the company's outlook of the housing market -- that is, it has unique insights into the market and it wants to bring them forward as part of a larger marketing strategy of the company. Smart play, if you ask me. Trulia, I should note, has a similar strategy. For instance, Trulia recently released a home price index which it claims is months ahead of traditional means of measuring home prices.Zillow Mortgage Market PlaceZillow, besides maintaining a perpetually updated database -- updated by private data feeds and user generated content -- also maintains a mortgage marketplace where consumers can submit their loan requests (anonymously) and receive a quote from a consumer-rated lender. In 2011, more than 5.5 million loan requests were submitted. The number of consummated loans was undisclosed. And as I noted above, its market place revenues were helped along by beginning to charge lenders for participation within the mortgage market place.The mortgage marketplace also further differentiates Zillow from Trulia. Zillow, it appears, has three sources of income: subscription (at three tiers), click-based advertising, and mortgage market place participation fees. Trulia only has the first two.Business TrendsFor those not in the know, a ""common sized income statement"" is where revenues for that year are equal to 100% and all the other expenses and line items in the income statement are a percentage of the revenues for that year. Basically, it allows one to see the trend of operating expenses -- as a percent of revenue -- over time. Below is Zillow's common sized income statement:As one can see, Sales and Marketing expense as a percent of revenue has declined. So, too, has technology and development (which is a capitalized cost anyways -- that is, the cash flow associated with it is amortized as an expense over time rather than at initial payment). Also note that pretty little 2% net profit margin, which is up to about 6% for the six month period ending June 30th, 2012. That is something other companies riding on the mobile/social-valuation-bubble do not have. (E.g., Yelp (NYSE:YELP), Pandora (NYSE:P), Trulia.)The company is also still paying its employees with stock based compensation to a great extent. For the period ending June 30th, 2011 23.604M shares were used in calculating the diluted income per share figure. For the same period in 2012, the number was 31.163M -- a huge dilution for current shareholders.Competition - The Online Real Estate Space Is (Very) CrowdedCompetition is hazardous for all investments, so let us list the players within the ""online data aggregation of real estate information"" business:I'll stop at 15, but trust me there are more.To borrow from its rival Trulia's S-1, this competition exists within a larger industry context:Perhaps these companies do have some room to grow. Yet, even while I say this, the wise words of Warren Buffett echo in my ear:How do you pick 1 winner out of 15?ValuationOf all the recent mobile/social companies to have IPO'd, I have liked Zillow the most -- not in terms of price and value, but as a company. But when we value Zillow, we still need to be prudent. We need to ask ourselves, how much money can I get back tomorrow for investing today? We need to make sure that we are not asking ourselves, can I get someone else to pay me more for these shares tomorrow, than today? We want to ask the first question -- that is the only way in which we can be (most) certain of the preserving our capital.After a demonstration it should be clear that Zillow's price is too high and will likely fall -- hopefully to such a point as to make the shares attractive.Let us assume the following:Then let us ask, how soon can it grow into its valuation? Or, how long will it take it to become ""fair valued"" [2]. Bold years are projected.If Zillow can continue growing revenues at a rate of 82% year-over-year, it would still take until about half way to 2016 for their valuation to get near fair value. That also assumes an improvement with their profit margin. For me, now that the company is making a profit, sometime between now and four years out there will likely be a better buying opportunity to buy the shares -- hopefully institutional analysts overshoot and Zillow misses ""estimates,"" thereby giving long-term thinkers the opportunity to buy. If, of course, Zillow's current trajectory continues.ConclusionZillow is a company to watch. It is entirely conceivable that a single hiccup, like missing a growth target, could disproportionately cause a sell off in the shares. Watch for the sell off -- and buy at a reasonable valuation to protect yourself on the downside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

959971,20568,2012-10-29T16:15:02-04:00,,"By Brian BolanIn the past, I wrote equity research on Zillow  (NASDAQ:Z) and seeing as the   hurricane is slowing the markets, I got a chance to re-visit my   model.  I updated my estimates for 3Q12 and saw that my charts are   really telling the story of what is going on at Zillow.For the most part, I believe that Zillow is a revenue story more   than anything else.  The key to understanding Zillow is knowing how it generates revenue, so let's take a deep look at how each segment   has trended over the last few quarters.From the top down, let’s look at the two major components of revenue. The bigger of the two buckets that collect revenue for Zillow is the   Marketplace segment.  It is comprised of mostly of premier agent   subscriptions, but also contains revenue from the acquired Diverse   Solutions (agent websites), Rent Juice (rentals) and the revenue   that is generated from mortgages.Here is the graph for how marketplace revenues have trended over the   last several quarters:(click images to enlarge)  A further breakdown of the largest component of marketplace   revenues is the number of premier agent subscribers.  Zillow   publishes this number every quarter.    Having this number allows investors to break out an average revenue   per user, but this includes the other items that were mentioned   above, so it’s not a 100% accurate number.  It’s more about the trend,   and this quarter we will see Zillow give a cleaner number for this   metric.  The SEC asked for this further breakdown, and Zillow agreed   to provide it. So this graph should just be looked at for the trend   and not the actual numbers, as it will change:  The second bucket of revenue comes from advertising on Zillow.  This   type of advertising is called display advertising, and is common   among most Internet sites.  Here is a graph of the trend of display   advertising revenues:  We get more detail from that line item as well, as the company   reports the number of unique users that visit the site on a monthly   and quarter basis.  Here is the graph that speaks to that trend:  A deeper dive into that segment would be to take the display revenue   and then divide that by unique users to get a revenue per unique   user number. Again, it’s best to look at this as just a trending   number to look at:  When we look at total revenue, we see the a breakdown in the chart   below.  It shows how premier agent subscriptions have grown -- not only   in absolute numbers -- but how it has affected revenue mix.  Over time,   it would not be surprising to see the subscription numbers increase   meaningfully, while display revenues should only grow modestly.  Now that you have a better handle on how Zillow generates and   reports its revenue, it's time to chime in with a guess as to where you   expect the revenue to come in at. Here are my estimates for the key   metrics. Ccomment on where you think the numbers will come in when   Zillow reports on November 5, 2012.Read the full analyst report on Z (email registration required)."

Shares of the online real estate market place ended their first day up 41% to $24.00 per share.The public offeringTrulia offers an online market place for home search. The extensive database and friendly user-interface is used by 22.0 million unique visitors in June of 2012. Trulia sold 6.0 million shares for $17.00 a piece. The firm sold 5 million shares in the offering, with selling shareholders selling another 1 million shares. Trulia raised $85 million in gross proceeds in the offering process. Based on the offer price of $17, the firm is valued at $449 million.The offering is quite a success. Initially the firm and its bankers set an offer price range of $14-$16 per share. In total, the firm and selling shareholders, sold 23% of its shares outstanding. At Thursday's closing price of $24.00, the firm is valued at $590 million. Major banks which brought the company public were J.P. Morgan, RBC Capital Markets, Deutsche Bank, William Blair and Needham & Company.ValuationTrulia operates an online marketplace giving consumers a powerful tool to research homes and neighborhoods. Real estate professionals can market their listings and attract customers. The website attracts more than 22.0 million unique visitors per month. Furthermore 360,000 real estate professionals are active, of which 21,544 have a paid subscription, generating average revenues per user of $140 per month.The company reported annual revenues of $38.5 million for its annual year of 2011, up 94% on the year before. The company reported a net loss of $6.2 million, compared to a loss of $3.8 million in 2011.For the first six months of 2012, the company generated revenues of $29.0 million, up 79% compared to 2011. Losses came in at $7.6 million, compared to a loss of $2.6 million in 2011.The company operates with roughly $10 million in cash and equivalents and a similar amount in debt, as of June 30. Assuming net proceeds of $80 million from the offer process, the net cash position of Trulia would come in around $80 million.Based on a rough annual revenue estimate of $65 million for 2012, the market values Trulia at 8 times annual revenues, assuming a valuation of operating assets at $510 million. Most likely, the company will continue to lose money for the full year of 2012.Investment ThesisAfter weeks of a public offering drought, the public debut of Trulia was a big success. Shares ended their first day at $24, almost double the initial midpoint of the guided offering range of $15. A lack of offerings in recent weeks and strong equity markets resulted in strong demand. Furthermore, investors are enthusiastic about the strong revenue growth of the company, even as it does not translate into profits in the short term.Trulia is a competitor of Zillow (Z) whose shares have more than doubled in 2012 alone. Zillow generated annual revenues of $66 million in 2011, on which it earned $1 million. The company is valued at $1.3 billion, or 20 times trailing revenues. This multiple compares to 13 times trailing annual revenues for Trulia. Zillow is already profitable, while Trulia is not expected to generate profits in 2012.While shares are anything but cheap on a traditional valuation standpoint, the company is only valued at roughly half a billion. Given the massive audience, prospects of good mobile user subscription growth, and strong overall visitor growth, shares might be rather cheap.For enterprising investors afraid of initiating an outright long position, one could set up a spread trade between Zillow and Trulia. An investor could short Zillow which trades at 20 times trailing annual revenues, after shares have doubled in 2012. Trulia trades at ""merely"" 13 times trailing revenues, even after Thursday's jump.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Generally, transaction sizes and margins are high in real estate so multiple revenue models, including sponsored listings and subscriptions, tend to work well. Both Trulia and Zillow are aggressively going after the 1.8 million licensed real estate agents in the U.S. The agents have held out and maybe won the first battle - remember Zip Realty? But now the reality of the majority of activity being online is forcing them to come over. Their fees remain intact though; at least for now.There are a few differences in the fundamental approach Trulia is taking vis-à-vis Zillow. Trulia is concentrating more on related local information important for moving families, like schools and neighborhood analysis.ManagementWe've listed the team here. On the roadshow you only get to hear from the painfully mechanical CEO for most of the time. He could suck the energy out of the best story around. The CEO is fine but totally scripted and lifeless. The management flatness nags at us as we go through the fundamentals. We have the Zillow roadshow slides and the Zillow IPO roadshow transcript but not the full video.The vast majority of the Zillow team is from Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE)/Hotwire but a few hail from Ticketmaster and Yahoo! (YHOO). Overall the Zillow team is a notch above the Trulia group based on their background and experience.Business ModelTrulia is generating revenue from a combination of advertising and a freemium model for agents.Paid products are targeted at real estate agents who can use Trulia as their business platform. Cost is $1,500/year, which the company suggests is a 10x return on investment for the average agent. Trulia claims acquisition costs of $500 for a customer with a ""life-time revenue"" of $5,000 in ""high demand"" zip codes.Paying subscribers are growing rapidly (~50%/year) and average revenue per user is increasing. Company is on a path to do well over $60M in 2012 versus $39M in 2011.There is lots of hand waving going on regarding the path between the current business model (-5% EBITDA) and the target (47.5% EBITDA) - That's over 40 points of expansion!We believe a few parts of it - like R&D, G&A and even Gross Margin - but the sales and marketing goal of 17.5% versus the current 46% is probably off by 10 points. Even a 27% EBITDA margin would be a good target. It's not clear why management decided to stretch beyond what most rational people would given the current state of the company, the market and the potential for competitive rivalry.There's another odd fly in the ointment when the CFO puts out some figures on user targets. The goal of 225,000 paying subscribers seems not only doable, but even modest. But the $450/month ARPU?! That's almost insane. Remember that's average so that means they will have agents paying much more. Given the current ARPU this seems like a huge stretch. Again, the number of subscribers is modest and could easily be 2x and allow a reasonable ARPU target of $225/month.ConclusionFortunately for Trulia, their arch competitor has done very well as an IPO over the last year. The shares stand at more than double the $20 IPO price and just below the $43 secondary offering price. As a multiple of revenue the shares trade at 14x which is more than double the proposed valuation of Trulia at the mid-point.Zillow is more profitable than Trulia and has enough advantages over Trulia to trade at a premium. But the market is large and attractive enough to support at least two successful players (there are others like Redfin, Craigslist, and Realtor.com).We expect the deal to do well even though the management team and the story feel a little less inspiring than they should.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The market is at very low activity levels, especially for new housing, and as such, it's likely that these activity levels will increase over time. Even rather pessimistic projections would see housing activity about doubling from where it stands today.Knowing this, the stock market has gone a bit bonkers regarding homebuilders (NYSEARCA:XHB). There's nothing like a sure thing, and housing recovering is the closest to a sure thing that speculators can find. Of course, betting on a housing recovery by buying stocks that discount two housing recoveries, like many of the homebuilders do, is hardly a sure thing.The HomebuildersIt's hard to take in just how much some homebuilders have recovered. While a housing recovery is to be expected, nothing tells us that we'll go back to the bubble forming 2000s. Yet, stocks such as Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) or Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) have recovered all the way back to levels previously hit only during the housing bubble. The charts below clearly show this (Source: Yahoo Finance):(click images to enlarge)Although some earnings recovery is certainly expected, the stocks have recovered well ahead of such improvement. LEN sells for 24 times estimated 2013 earnings, and TOL for 36.9 times. When looking at TTM measures and taking into account debt, things get even more extraordinary, with LEN trading at an EV/EBITDA of 41 times and TOL at 46 times. These are extraordinary valuation multiples, discounting a lot of good that's yet to come.An AlternativeZillow (NASDAQ:Z), on the other hand, might be a better way to play such a recovery. Not a perfect way, because Zillow, too, already discounts a lot of happiness, but still better. Why?First, Zillow has more of a moat. You can't duplicate a Zillow next door and expect to have instant success, since Zillow is protected by network effects. People go check homes on Zillow because that's where the volume is, and agents work with Zillow because that's where the people are -- the whole thing reinforces itself and makes for a pretty potent barrier to entry for competition. Obviously, barriers to entry are what makes for large and sustainable margins, and thus, it's no wonder that Zillow targets 30-35% EBITDA margins in the short term, and perhaps as much as 40% over the long term.Homebuilders have no such luxury. Though most of the housing recovery centers around homebuilders, they are in a market dominated by cut-throat competition, where margins are cyclical and most times, lousy. That is not going to change.At the same time, Zillow naturally gains from any increase in housing activity, as well as penetration of its systems both in the homebuyer and agent markets. Thus it gains twice, from market expansion and from increased penetration.I'm not a big fan of Zillow's present valuation, though. It trades at 46.6 times estimated 2013 earnings, and those earnings have been falling. The stock trend is also ugly, with a recent 20%+ plunge in a single day. But I believe the fundamental improvement and structural advantages in its business model will eventually overcome both the downward stock and the estimate cuts.For more details on Zillow, I would recommend two additional articles from fellow SA contributors: ConclusionWhile Zillow trades at a demanding valuation and the stock and estimate trends are ugly, it still looks like an intrinsically better way to play the housing market rebound versus owning homebuilders. Zillow is probably a buy on weakness (which it has had a lot of recently).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in Z over the next 72 hours.

Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) is struggling, largely due to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is pondering same-day delivery. And Realtors are scratching their heads about Zillow (NASDAQ:Z).I am fortunate to live in an area where housing has turned into a seller's market. This comes with a caveat: it is only a market for sellers of turn-key homes. New or used, if the house doesn't have every and all attainable features desired by the average buyer, then it will not sell. The cause of this is not difficult to trace, as bankers are hesitant to provide equity loans for home improvement purposes - the bane of Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW). Customers are demanding finished homes that do not require improvements. Having recently purchased a new home, I understand this completely.More recently, a coworker put her house up for sale, provoking a lot of water cooler discussion (one of my favorite workday medications). Most notable was the realization that the typical Realtor fee is six percent - $12,000 on a $200,000; $30,000 on a $500,000 home sale. Not cheap. I didn't have to mention Zillow, as the seller already knew about the free ""For Sale by Owner"" option that the company provides in addition to its popular core home-valuation service.The home sold in just two days. Mind you, it was a very nice home that had been finished with all of the bells and whistles that are necessary to sell in this market. At first, I suspected that the home had been priced too low. But a quick check revealed that it was priced on the high side of recent comparable sales in the area - all with similar condition and feature sets. The sale has since closed and the seller walked away with 100 percent of the sale instead of just 94 percent - impressive.Although the real estate market is in horrible shape by any standard, the math still bodes well for Zillow. Sales of existing homes are on track to hit 4.47 million annually with an average sale price of $187,300. New home sales are on track to hit 372,000 annually with an average sale price of $224,000. Combined, this works out to a total market of $920,559,000,000. Realize that a healthy market will be well over a trillion dollars annually.Zillow is to Realtors what digital media is to Best Buy. Today, the company is peripheral to real estate sales, taking only the scraps that fall from the table. As it becomes more popular with increasingly digitally-enabled consumers, it will have the opportunity to position itself squarely in the middle of this market. There is huge room to undercut the existing six percent commission from Realtors. Even at half percent, the market potential works out to nearly $5 billion in revenue using today's anemic numbers. And there exists a need to produce a coordinated, cohesive end-to-end product: search, appraisal, title and mortgage. If Zillow management can execute, it can add value to every aspect of the transaction.But, first, it needs to improve its for sale by owner service. As it sits now, buyers and sellers are left to coordinate home viewing/inspection on their own - something that can be awkward without a neutral third-party to unlock the door and supervise potential buyers. I am into my second home and, in both instances, this is the only real service that my Realtors provided (everyone else involved got their own check at closing).Is babysitting worth 6 percent? The bully has been taking our lunch money for way too long. Buy Zillow.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

880261,22829,2012-09-21T07:22:33-04:00,,"By Tejas VenkateshAmid the consumer tech IPO lull following the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) offering, real  estate website Trulia (TRLA) enjoyed a solid opening on its first day as a  public company. First, it priced a dollar above its indicated range, at  $17 per share. Then, encouraged by its robust growth, investors bid up  the stock further to $23 per share.Trulia provides an online marketplace, delivered through the web and  mobile applications, that lets consumers and real estate professional  connect with each other. Unlike traditional real estate websites like  REALTOR.com, Trulia gives users detailed information on crime, commute  and schools.On the top line, the company has put up astonishing growth. In the 12  months ended in June, Trulia generated $51m in revenue, up from $38m in  calendar year 2011. It makes money from a combination of advertising on  its website and a freemium model for real estate professionals, with  the latter accounting for more than two-thirds of its revenue.The offering valued Trulia’s equity at $448m, or 8.8 times trailing  sales, and the company currently garners a market cap of roughly $600m,  or 12x trailing sales. That’s good value creation for Trulia, which has  raised roughly $33m in venture capital from Accel Partners, Fayez  Sarofim and Sequoia Capital. In addition to high growth, public  investors were also surely encouraged by the broader housing recovery in  recent months.That’s not to say that Trulia couldn’t have done better. In recent  weeks, its primary rival Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) has traded close to 14x sales. In part,  that can be explained by Zillow’s bigger size and outpaced growth. In  the 12 months ended in June, Zillow doubled its sales, reaching $90m.  But last week, Zillow filed a lawsuit against Trulia, alleging that the  company infringed upon a home valuation patent. Trulia denies the  allegations. While the eventual outcome is not yet known, investors  likely factored that into the stock price."

The surprise was  mainly due to a strong performance for Zillow Mortgage Marketplace. With  a long-term earnings growth projection of 40%, this Zacks No. 1 Rank  (Strong Buy) real estate information marketplace operator offers solid  growth opportunities.Second-Quarter ResultsOn Aug. 7, Zillow reported second-quarter  net income of 4 cents per  share, compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate at a loss of 1 cent.  The company broke even in the year-ago quarter. Revenue jumped 75% year over year to $27.8 million, driven by a 102%  surge in Marketplace revenue and a 33% increase in Display revenue.Zillow has already established its footprint in the residential real  estate and mortgages business, and is now building strength in the  rentals marketplace. In early June, Zillow acquired San Francisco-based  RentJuice, a provider of rental relationship management software, for  $40 million in cash.Total costs and expenses escalated 85% to $26.5 million, largely due to the 116% jump in sales and marketing expenses. Zillow experienced record usage across mobile and the web in the second quarter, with average monthly unique users growing 61%.On Sept. 5, Zillow announced an offering of approximately 3.2  million shares of its Class A common stock. The proceeds will be  deployed to meet working capital needs, sales and marketing activities,  general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures.GuidanceZillow expects to generate revenue between $30.0 million and $31.0 million in  the third quarter of 2012. This represents a year-over-year increase of  60%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $4.75 million and $5.25 million for the third quarter.Positive Estimate RevisionsFor 2012, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 12 cents,  up nearly 71.4% over the last 60 days. This suggests a year-over-year  increase of 67.9%. Likewise, for 2013 the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents improved  46.9% over the same time frame, representing a possible year-over-year  increase of 300%.Stretched ValuationShares of Zillow are roughly trading at 13.9 times on a price-to-sales basis,  significantly ahead of the peer group average of 1.8 times. On a  price-to-book (P/B) basis, shares are trading at 11.0 times compared with the  peer group average of 2.2 times.Zillow has a trailing 12-month ROE of 4.9% compared with the peer group  average of 5.1%. However, given the strong fundamentals, the premium  valuation looks justified.Ever since the second-quarter earnings release Aug. 7, the stock  price has grown 2.1%.

849821,26971,2012-09-06T09:06:24-04:00,,"Zillow (NASDAQ:Z)'s CEO Spencer Rascoff shared tips with entrepreneurs on how to prepare for an initial public offering such as the one he pulled off in July 2011, the Seattle Times reported in recent weeks. Be profitable, Rascoff advised. He had waited until his online real estate firm was profitable, Rascoff reportedly said.While Zillow has indeed reported profits in every quarter but two since March 2011, more than a fourth of its assets now consist of estimates that could need revision down the line. The financial data in the company's regulatory filings result in an AGR score of 6, indicating higher accounting and governance risk than 94% of comparable companies.Rascoff and his team, facing Wall Street analysts who insist on explosive performance, on August 8 promised that their sales would improve by around 60% year over year to between $30 and $31 million in the third quarter. That sounds unambitious compared to the company's nearly 102% year over year sales growth in the first quarter. Meanwhile, rival Trulia is nipping at Zillow's heels and attempting its own public offering.Under pressure to grow, Rascoff has been aggressively buying up companies. He and his team said this May that they would spend $40 million cash on the rental relationship management software provider RentJuice, which launched in 2009, has 31 employees, and whose revenue is ""currently immaterial,"" according to Rascoff on his August 8 conference call. In spring 2011 the company also acquired the online real estate listing firm Postlets for an undisclosed amount. During the same year for around $7.8 million in cash and stock, Zillow bought Diverse Solutions, which has 18 employees. Rascoff and his team ended up paying around $35.4 million more for these acquisitions than they were worth on the books as of June 30, and this goodwill accounts for more than 26% of Zillow's total assets.How much money those acquisitions end up making in the long-run remains an open question. Rascoff said August 8 that his team doesn't expect near-term significant monetization from the rentals business associated with RentJuice, but they think the market opportunity is ""very significant,"" given factors such as Zillow's consumer traffic and the billions spent marketing rentals every year. If Rascoff's guess on this one turns out wrong, his team will have to revise their goodwill estimates downward in later years and take a hit to earnings as a result.So far the recent acquisitions have been weighing on Zillow's efficiency, as the company generated an average of nearly 86 cents of sales per dollar of assets over the past twelve months, down from 93 cents per dollar the previous quarter. Rascoff better keep an eye on that number, if he wants his advice to other entrepreneurs to be taken seriously.Region: North AmericaCountry: United StatesSector: FinancialsIndustry: Real Estate OperationsMarket Cap: $ 1,110.3 mm (Mid Cap)ESG Rating: N/AAGR Rating: Very Aggressive (6)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: GMI Ratings pays me to write about corporate governance."
511381,26071,2012-04-19T15:02:14-04:00,,"Today I am going to step out my normal writing about dividend stocks, and write about a high PE, no dividend, possible growth stock. This stock is Zillow (NASDAQ:Z). For those who may not know, Zillow is a website that has wide variety of real estate information, including for sale information, property tax information, price the home sold for previously and much more. They also have a very controversial figure available called the Zestimate. The Zestimate is a computer calculated value of your house, based on a formula that Zillow does. It factors in the age and size of your house and property and compares it to others in the area. Areas where public information is available and there are many home sales in your area, it appears to be very accurate. With no home sales in an area and little public information, it's definitely more of a guess.I could talk quite a bit about the information that Zillow has, or can obtain. I feel as though they are the Google of real estate. However, I do feel like they still have some work to go to better use their data. I, along with many others, prefer Zillow to get our real estate data. See the charts below of internet traffic on the sites via Alexa.comFor realtor.comFor zillow.comThere is a large amount of information we can pull from these traffic graphs. Zillow passed Realtor.com in mid 2011 as the largest real estate website on the web. Today Zillow ranks #491 in the World for all website traffic, and #99 in the United States, compared to #744 and #164 for realtor.com. Daily pageviews for Zillow are close to 3.5 million.Let's compare website traffic with the stock price chart here from MSN.Decreased website traffic numbers in November and December may have caused the price to decrease. However, if you look at 2011 numbers, and even realtor.com numbers, there has been a decrease in views for real estate sites in the 4th quarter, probably due to the holiday season, and the fact that most families prefer not to move their kids during the school year. Zillow released the 8K for March, and their traffic is up to 32.3 million unique visitors per month, up 67% from March 2011 and well above their peak in 2011 in August of 25 million. I'm confident the dip in the winter months was a seasonal item, and not truly a decline in traffic to the site.The first quarter conference call will be on May 2nd. The earnings estimate is current $ 0.00. However, the 4th quarter 2011 earnings were projected to be $ -0.03, and actually were $ 0.03, which was a very pleasant surprise, and gave Zillow 2 straight profitable quarters. I expect that to become 3 on May 2nd. 2012 projected EPS is $ 0.13 and 2013 EPS is expected to jump to $0.37.At the current price of just under $36 a share, that still places forward PE at close to 100. I'm usually quite scared of a huge PE like this, but it is better than an internet giant that we all know, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). They currently trade at around a 140 PE ratio.Conclusion: Zillow still has a long way to go as a company. However they have innovative ideas and an information advantage over competitor websites. If the consumers continue to flock to Zillow, realtors will have to keep up, and money will be made via realtors paying Zillow to be listed on the site. Hopefully more creative information will continue to be added to the site, such as crime rates, standardized test scores, etc which would make it even more valuable. I placed a small position in Zillow, believing there is growth potential with this unique website, and also growth in the housing market.Disclosure: I am long (Z)"
670251,24710,2012-06-19T15:38:58-04:00,,"In a world of high-multiple internet stocks, Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) might just win the rather repugnant award for 'most overvalued'. Zillow describes itself as a ""real estate marketplace...[that] provides vital information about homes, real estate listings and mortgages...enabling homeowners, buyers, sellers and renters to connect with real estate and mortgage professionals."" A cursory look at the company's valuation shows a trailing twelve month (TTM) price-to-earnings ratio of 850. That's assuming non-GAAP 2011 earnings per share of 4 cents as reported by the company. As Zillow is supposedly a high growth name, it makes sense to evaluate it on forward earnings as well. Unfortunately, that measure is only slightly less crazy than the TTM P/E: Zillow's forward price-to-earnings ratio is a lofty 121 based on analysts' consensus estimates of 28 cents per share for 2012. While I maintain that no amount of growth is sufficient to support such a high multiple, it is worth noting that an examination of the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q reports shows growth declining in some rather important areas.Growth in the company's 'premier agent subscriber program' (i.e. Zillow's service that allows local real estate agents to post their contact information and listings on the site) has slowed dramatically. From December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010 premier agent subscriber growth was 193%. From December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011, that rate of growth fell to 97%. According to the company's 10-Q, premier agent subscriber growth from March 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012 was just 74%. This is a very disturbing trend given that premier agent subscriber revenue accounts for most of the company's 'marketplace revenue', which, in turn, accounted for nearly two thirds (64%) of the company's total revenue in 2011. The other 36% of total revenue in 2011 came from 'display advertising'. It is important to note that display ads accounted for 57% of total revenue in 2010, meaning that the company is increasingly relying on 'marketplace revenue', a category which could begin to suffer from the falling growth rate of its main cash generator: premier agent subscriptions.Another 'key growth driver' for Zillow is unique users. The company counts a unique user ""the first time an individual accesses one of [its] websites...during a calendar month"". Unique users are important for two reasons. First, the more users the site has, the more valuable it is to real estate agents who are potential 'premier agent subscribers' and second, the company's display revenue depends upon the number of impressions generated. While the average number of monthly unique users grew 86% year over year during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to year over year growth of just 66% in the fourth quarter of 2010, a bit further down in the company's 10-K is a quarter by quarter breakdown which shows that, during the fourth quarter of 2011, monthly unique users declined from the previous quarter for the first time in at least two years. If the growth rate of average monthly unique users continues to decline, so too will display revenue.Given all of this, it seems doubtful that shares of Zillow can maintain their current valuations. Stocks whose valuations depend on unsustainable growth fall hard and fast when that growth shows signs of dissipating. It is also worth noting that on a GAAP basis, Zillow made no money last year:Investors are reminded that paying any amount of money for shares of a company that is not profitable makes very little sense.Some analysts will undoubtedly argue that Zillow is also a play on a recovery in the housing market which, many note, has likely finally found a bottom. Be advised: A bottom is not a recovery. With the economic recovery still in question and the reputation of high multiple internet stocks damaged by Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) shaky IPO, Zillow is about as risky a bet as any.

The company’s revenues come mainly from realtors and other advertisers using the site to drum up business.Zillow has grown revenues every year since 2006; it grossed $30 million in 2010. Furthermore, the second quarter of this year brought the firm’s first profitable quarter–and most assuredly not the last–as revenues soared 116% from the same quarter in the previous year.Taking advantage of that milestone, Zillow went public on July 20, just as the broad market was topping. Shares debuted at 20, zoomed to 60 that very day, and then tumbled, with the market, to a low of 23, before climbing back to 38 two weeks ago.But this is not a recommendation of Zillow. Before I recommend the stock, I need to see more constructive chart action, as well as more liquidity. This is, instead, a prelude to a discussion of a study released by Zillow last month, just three days before the IPO, and picked up by the Wall Street Journal, that suggests housing prices are cheap in Las Vegas and Detroit and almost back to “normal” in the U.S. as a whole. (If you infer from the timing of this study that Zillow might be trying to drum up some business of its own, you might be right.)To draw this conclusion, Zillow hangs its hat on the fact that from 1985 through 1999, housing prices tracked income very closely, as these charts show.In Virginia Beach, Virginia, housing prices averaged 2.5 times local annual income through that “baseline” period. In Sacramento, California, they averaged 3.3 times local annual income. In Las Vegas, Nevada, they averaged 2.7 times local annual income. And in Detroit, Michigan, they averaged 2.1 times local annual income. Nationally, the average house sold for 2.9 times average annual income.But in 2000, as the housing market began to overheat–I won’t waste your time repeating the reasons–housing prices began to climb above these averages, and they kept on climbing for roughly six years. Of course, you know what happened.And now, more than five years into the decline of the housing market, Zillow is joining the chorus of voices suggesting this downtrend is near an end.Well, I don’t think so, and my reasoning is this.First, to construct a baseline from a 15-year sample is a bit shortsighted. A quick look online reveals that in the decade before 1985, the national ratio was roughly 10% lower. Before that, data is murkier; the one constant is variability, thanks to market forces.Second – and this is my strongest point – I know from experience that when charts fall from an overbought level, they don’t just return to “normal,” they typically fall to an oversold level.So I think housing prices, on average, still have further to slide… and I’m not just saying 2% or 3%. I think housing prices will stay soft for as long as it takes for most Americans to stop thinking about houses as investments.When that day comes, houses will be good investments again, but until that day – and I think it’s many years away – you’ll be safer if you simply think of your house as your home.Disclosure: None."
290133,24764,2011-08-26T16:42:23-04:00,,"Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) has some promising developments from their latest earnings report. Known for their Zestimate home values, Zillow was the darling of the housing boom. Those times have long since disappeared and Zillow's hype has died along with it.Zillow may once again be in the spotlight. I'm still bearish on the housing market but Zillow may be a great investment opportunity for long term investors.Here are some highlights from their latest earning report:- Marketplace Revenue - Revenue has increased 269% to $9.7 million compared to the same quarter the previous year. The increase was mainly attributable to the increase in the amount of Premier Agent subscribers. These subscribers pay Zillow on a straight-line contractual basis. Premier Agents display ads near home listings they serve. Marketplace revenue represent 61% of total revenues for the 3 months ended June 30, 2011.- Premier Agent Subscribers - Zillow saw a subscription increase of 180%, now totaling 13,385 subscribers. This increase was primarily due to their partnership with Yahoo Real Estate.- Unique Users - Amount of unique users increased 93%, to a record 20.8 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared to 10.8 million unique users in the same period last year. This in turn helped increase display revenue by 30%. Zillow saw revenue of $6.1 Million.- Net Income - Zillow had its first net profitable quarter generating $1.6 million. This could mark a big turning point for Zillow. This is especially true considering they have $64 million in NOL that they could carry forward.- Mobile Application - Zillow recently launched a Zillow Mortgage App Marketplace which allow borrowers to send loan requests and connect with verified lenders. Zillow has mobile real estate applications that cover all the major phone operating systems. Zillow was 11.9 million times from mobile devices.Zillow is in a unique situation where they may be isolated from being heavily exposed directly to the housing market. If Zillow could continue to expand their Premier Agent program they could potentially grow earnings even though the housing market slows down. This has a lot to do with their potential market. There are about 300,000 real estate agents in the United States and Zillow currently has a little over 13,000 in the program. During tough markets, agents need more exposure to stay in business. Agents then do more advertising and marketing to generate more sales. This in turn could generate additional subscriptions for Zillow.I like Zillow's prospects long term but feel the stock may have gotten ahead of itself. I feel pullbacks are great opportunities to buy and play as short term trades. I will keep an eye out for signals that the housing market may be in trouble once again. A severe housing decline may cause many realtors to leave their business which may endanger Zillow's earnings.NOTE: All information provided is for educational purposes only and not in any way to be considered investment advice.

396131,24751,2012-02-28T02:37:18-05:00,,"This article is an analysis of Zillow's (NASDAQ:Z) current business and future prospects as demonstrated by their fourth quarter performance. After review, we have come to the following conclusions:What Happened:After the market close on Wednesday, February 15, Zillow reported its fiscal 2011 fourth quarter (December) results. The company reported GAAP earnings per share of $0.03, which was $0.03 ahead of the breakeven consensus (8 analysts) estimate. Revenue of $19.9m (up 108% year-over-year) was modestly ahead of the $18.8m consensus.Other Metrics:Guidance:For FQ1 (March): Zillow management offered the following guidance in its published earnings announcement and conference call:What It Means:Zillow's fourth quarter was an impressive demonstration of market power.The fact that Marketplace revenue (up 169% y/y) grew faster than Premier Agent subscribers (up 95% y/y) means that Zillow is not only signing up more agents, it's getting a larger share of marketing spend from each agent, because agents are renewing at higher subscription rates.Moreover, Zillow has waiting lists of brokers in some markets, and when some current broker customers decide to end their subscription relationship with Zillow, they are easily and quickly replaced by those on the waiting list, and at higher price points. Some brokers at the end of their subscriptions are choosing to maintain the same subscription rate, but in doing so get less exposure on Zillow's site.Postives/Upward changes to expectations:Google just exited the Mortgage Marketplace business (a $10b annual market), improving Zillow's competitive position.Zillow will shortly be rolling out a customer relationship management, or CRM, platform for agents. The new product will help agents better manage and organize the contacts they receive from Zillow via a mobile device or desktop. The app is designed to save the contacts agents receive through Zillow, including their recent search criteria, and allows agent to make individual notes and star high-priority contacts.Given the importance of an agent's client list, success in this type of CRM effort could be very powerful in furthering Zillow's market influence. This effort is just beginning so the only financial impact is development expense, but we'll watch this carefully throughout 2012.Negatives/Downward changes to expectations:Display ad growth decelerated from 57% in the third quarter of 2011 to 38% in the fourth quarter. Zillow management described the lower growth as being above expectations, but this number has been volatile for several quarters.Some pushback from out-of-contract agent subscribers being asked to re-subscribe at higher price points just to maintain the same level of promotional support. This is certainly logical, and hasn't yet manifested in widespread (or even moderate) subscriber defections. But we'll watch this trend very closely: Zillow's revenue growth is ever-more tied to subscribers, as opposed to advertising.There has been an acceleration in insider selling at Zillow, which is not surprising as we are now firmly past the 180 day traditional lock-up period since Zillow's July 20, 2011 IPO. Thus far in February alone, there have been over 1 million shares sold by Zillow insiders. The majority has come from Chairman Richard Barton and Vice-Chairman Lloyd Frink. But others, including CEO Spencer Rascoff, are now selling as well. This selling is unsurprising and with 2/3rd of the shares outstanding still in the hands of insiders and Zillow's venture capital investors, we expect it to continue.Valuation (Valuation Decay, DCF and Comparative Analyses):Valuation Decay Analysis:We're introducing a new valuation methodology that we feel is particularly suitable for young, high-growth, high P/E companies like Zillow. We call this the Crabtree Valuation Decay model, which we feel reflects the inevitable deceleration in both company growth and market valuation.Many high-growth technology companies have gone public in the past thirty years, from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and VMware (NYSE:VMW). It's our experience that even for companies that have maintained high levels of revenue and profit growth, price:earnings ratios decline over time. A quick review of the aforementioned firms shows that virtually all of them have valuations that have ""decayed"" to nearly market multiples (the forward P/E on the S&P 500 is estimated by Birinyi Associates at 13.1)As you can see from the table, there are still companies with unusually high valuations like Amazon, as well as Salesforce.com (forward P/E of 88, 36% revenue growth). But there are also no shortage of ones like Priceline.com (P/E of 20, 45% growth). In fact, the calculated median of forward P/E ratios among all technology stocks in our database is only 14.5; the most recent quarterly revenue growth median is 8.0%.So with old age and decelerating growth being inevitable, lower valuations are as well. Therefore, let's analyze Zillow through this prism:The takeaway from this table is to note that (using our assumptions), early in the process the high earnings growth rate outweighs the impact of the decaying valuation multiple, leading to the estimated share price reaching $70.75 in three years. Thereafter, the earnings growth isn't large enough to overcome the still-decaying multiple, leading to a share price decline.Of course, all of these items are estimates, except for the current share price and current earnings multiple. If earnings growth doesn't decelerate as fast as estimated, the future share price will be higher. If the multiple decays faster, the future share price will be lower. And so forth.But because we feel our assumptions are reasonable, and based upon real-world averages, we're comfortable with the conclusion they yield: Zillow stock is very likely going to increase faster than the market in the next three years.Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis:In addition to our Valuation Decay model of Zillow, we maintain a DCF model for the company. We have updated the parameters with the most recent Q4 data to arrive at our DCF value:· Term: 5 years;· Initial Cash Flow: $9.804 million (this represents the estimated annual free cash flow for Zillow's just-completed fiscal year);· Initial Cash Flow Growth Rate: 80%, decelerating to a…· Long Term Cash Flow Growth Rate: 6%;· Discount Rate: 8.95% (derived using CAPM: Risk Free Rate = 3.10% from the 30-year Treasury Bond; 4.4% equity risk premium from Ibbotson; and an estimated Beta of 1.30);· Current Share Count: 30.592 million (up from about 24m shares two months ago, and estimated by management to be about 33m by the end of 2012).Using these inputs, our calculated DCF value per Zillow share is $60.30, almost exactly double the current $30.00 share price. Note that the free cash flow growth rates for years 2-5 in our DCF model are the same growth rates for earnings in our Valuation Decay model, just for consistency. Note also that the five-year DCF value of $60.30 is almost identical to the $60.40 value after five year in the Valuation Decay model - this is a mathematical co-incidence and they're not comparable anyway: the DCF is a ""here-and-now"" value; the Valuation Decay number represents the estimated value in five years.We've written before that the DCF model isn't the best one to use for a fast-growing, young company such as Zillow. But we include it anyway because it utilizes cash flow rather than earnings; the former tends to be steadier and harder for a company's accountants to manipulate.Comparative Analysis:The following table compares Zillow and six other software-as-a-service companies:The primary conclusions we draw from this table are:· Zillow and LinkedIn have much in common: two recently public companies, with triple-digit growth rates, very high P/E valuations and relatively low floats. Zillow, however, lacks LinkedIn's ""Facebook Problem;"" i.e., a major, potentially overwhelming competitive threat.· Ancestry.com's forward P/E reflects its new status as a slower growing company. Profitable, yes. But our experience is that premium valuations come from growth, not profits. How else to explain Amazon's hypoxic valuation?What You Should Do About It (Buy, Sell or Hold?):We are changing our rating on shares of Zillow from Hold/Neutral to Buy/Long. Zillow is coming off a quarter in which it executed flawlessly, generated cash, and increased its market share. We feel that the company is well on its way to becoming a natural monopoly in the on-line real estate information sector.Until recently, we felt that despite Zillow's consistently excellent performance as an operating company, its stock valuation was excessively high. Moreover, shares ""un-locking"" after its July 2011 IPO would create a supply-demand imbalance, depressing the share price. However, the market seems to be absorbing additional supply. And the valuation no longer seems excessive, when placed in the context of future high earnings- and cash flow-growth rates, the latter driven by proven pricing power in its Premium Agent program.We conservatively estimate that 250,000 real estate agents in the U.S. are potential subscribers to Zillow's Premier Agent program; as of early 2012, the company had just under 16,000 subscribers, or 6.4% of the total. So the market opportunity remains quite large, the business model is proven, and management is successfully handling the responsibilities of being a public company. It's time to invest.Please see our complete research report on Zillow, published on Seeking Alpha in October 2011.Disclosure: I am long ARBA.Additional disclosure: I am long ARBA in the Separately Managed Account product for which I am the portfolio manager and in which I am an investor."
299726,24751,2011-10-14T18:11:02-04:00,,"(This is the second in our series about a certain kind of Internet Information provider that we call “Desired Monopolies.” Please see the first in the series, about Ariba, published on September 30.)Zillow: Admit It, You Can't Help Looking At This StockAs a company, you know you’re doing something right when customers and prospects in your primary market hate your guts, but sign up for your service in record numbers anyway.Well, your average realtor (we interviewed several as part of our research for this report) doesn’t quite “hate” Zillow, but the realtor-Zillow relationship is complicated. Realtors generally admire Zillow’s web site and its ability to efficiently (and prettily) provide a wealth of real estate information. However, realtors loath Zillow’s price estimates, invariably describing them as wrong and bemoaning the friction they cause when prospective clients cite them, only to have the realtor ""set them straight"" with local knowledge Zillow never catches.But the biggest thing realtors hate about Zillow is that ... they don’t own it. The National Association of Realtors licenses its realtor.com domain to Move, Inc. whose realtor.com web site was until just this summer more trafficked than Zillow. But Zillow.com, the 150th most visited site on the whole Web, with over 24 million unique visitors in September (up ~100% year-over-year) has blown by realtor.com. And it bothers realtors no end that while they originate real estate listings, they need to subscribe to Zillow directly to enjoy some of the premium services, like uploading listings directly to Zillow, or enhancing existing listings with extra photographs. Who’s in charge here?The answer, of course, is us. We can’t resist Zillow’s free, voyeuristic window into our neighbors’ homes, what they paid for them, and what they’re worth now. Zillow’s official business model calls for signing up more subscribing real estate agents, facilitating more mortgage originations, and selling more of its highly targeted advertising. But a cynic doesn’t have to think hard about all the additional info that Zillow could route through its platform:If Facebook charts our social graph, then Zillow clearly has the lead in charting our environmental graph. And as a Desired Monopoly, Zillow can be the trusted middleman, aggregating nice-to-have information into a must-have whole. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves: Zillow is compelling enough just as it is.Data SheetName: Zillow Inc.Market Cap: $703 millionTrailing 12-months Revenue: $44.9 millionForward Price:Earnings Ratio (estimated): 50xHQ: Seattle, WashingtonFounded: December, 2004DescriptionZillow is one of the largest real estate information marketplaces. The company provides vital information about homes, real estate listings and mortgages through its website and mobile applications. Additionally, homeowners, potential buyers and sellers are able to connect with real estate and mortgage service providers. Using proprietary automated valuation models, Zillow provides current home value estimates, known - awkwardly - as “Zestimates,” on over 100 million U.S. homes. Zillow also provides current rental price estimates, or “Rent Zestimates,” on homes and properties.Zillow makes money through subscriptions, lead generation (principally for mortgages) and advertising on its web site. Individuals and businesses that use Zillow have updated information on more than 28 million homes and added more than 60 million home photos, creating exclusive home profiles. Zillow’s Revenue Sources : Marketplace And Display (excerpted from Zillow’s IPO prospectus)Marketplace Revenues (61% of total revs in Q211, vs. 36% in Q210)Marketplace revenues consist of subscriptions sold to real estate agents under the Premier Agent program and cost-per-click ads related to the Zillow Mortgage Marketplace. These ads are sold to mortgage lenders. Zillow had 13,385 subscribers as of 6/30/11 (up 25% from the March quarter and 180% year-over-year). Subscription revenue was up 269% year-over-year in the June quarter.The Premier Agent program allows local agents to establish an online and mobile presence on Zillow in the zip codes they serve. Contact information for each Premier Agent is presented alongside home profiles and home listings within an agent’s zip code, assisting consumers in evaluating and selecting the real estate agent best suited for them. Subscription pricing varies by zip code. Terms are generally six to 12 months.In Zillow Mortgage Marketplace, participating qualified mortgage lenders make a prepayment to gain access to consumers interested in connecting with mortgage professionals. Consumers who request rates for mortgage loans in the Mortgage Marketplace are presented with personalized lender quotes from participating lenders. Zillow charges only when users click on their links for more information regarding a mortgage loan quote. Mortgage lenders can “re-up” with more funds as needed to continue to participate in the marketplace.Display Revenues (39% of total revs in Q211, vs.64% in Q210)  Display revenues primarily consist of graphical web and mobile advertising sold on a cost-per-thousand basis to advertisers including real estate brokerages, home builders, mortgage lenders and home services providers. Advertisers include telecommunications, automotive, insurance and consumer products companies. Growth in display revenues depends on continuing growth in traffic to the website and mobile applications, migration of advertising spend online from traditional broadcast and print media and development of new advertising products.Market Size And Zillow’s OpportunityFirst, some market data:Total Addressable Market CalculationsLet’s divide this generally into subscriptions and advertising.First: Subscriptions:The median real estate agent makes ~$40,000 annually. Assume $5,000/agent in work-related support expenses (ex-office space), including: local ad support, phone subsidy, Internet access, etc. So assume each agent could spend $1k-$2k/year on Zillow. (Our calculation is the current subscription rate is $1,500/year.) Now assume some sharing of subscriptions within brokerage offices, again reducing the total possible subscribers by half. Thus, the total addressable market is ~250,000 (working, compensated) real estate agents x $1,500/year = $375 million.Second: Advertising And Marketing Services:As the 150th most trafficked site on the Web, Zillow has much to offer in the way of targeted advertising. Using its own algorithms, for example, it can predict fairly reliably when a home in its database will shortly be put up for sale, thus allowing its advertisers (e.g. brokers, agents, re-modelers, movers) to rifle-shot ads straight to the person viewing that house’s information.By some estimates, the total marketing spend in the United States on real estate-related products and services is between $10 billion and $20 billion.With Zillow’s revenue run-rate at a mere $64m, there exists ample opportunity for Zillow take a much greater “share of wallet.” Not only because of the effectiveness of its advertising, but because being “on Zillow” will simply replace “being in the Yellow Pages.”Recent Financial PerformanceZillow’s second quarter ended on June 30. The company went public on July 20 and on August 24 issued its second quarter financial release. Revenue of $15.8 million was up 116% year-over-year, and the company was profitable for the first time on both an operating and pro-forma net income basis. Subsequent metrics, like page views and unique visitors to its web site reflect continued triple-digit growth in the near term.Concerns and IssuesNo company or investment is perfect, and Zillow has several issues that concern us.1. The Accelerated Lock-Up Agreement:Buried deep in Zillow’s IPO prospectus is the following boilerplate (don’t worry, I offer a plain English translation immediately following):“If, however, at any time beginning 90 days after the date of this prospectus, (i) we have filed with the SEC at least one quarterly report on Form 10-Q, (ii) the reported last sale price of our Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market is at least 33% greater than the initial public offering price per share set forth on the cover page of this prospectus for 20 trading days out of any 30 trading day period ending after the 90th day following the date of this prospectus (which 30 trading day period may begin prior to such 90th day), and (iii) the reported last sale price of our Class A common stock on the last day of that 30 trading day period described in clause (ii) is at least 25% greater than the initial public offering price, then 25% of each holder’s capital stock that is subject to the 180-day restrictions described above as of immediately prior to the opening of The Nasdaq Global Market on the day following the end of the 30 trading day period, or the initial release date, will be automatically released from those restrictions on the initial release date provided that none of the underwriters have published research on us within 15 days prior to the day following the initial release date. If an underwriter has published research on us within 15 days prior to the day following the initial release date, the initial release date will be deferred until the expiration of the 15-day period beginning on, and including, the date such research is published.”Plain English: On any day after October 18, if Zillow’s stock price has closed above $26.66 for 20 of the prior 30 trading days, then almost all of the non-IPO shares will begin unlocking, and insiders will be able to sell as much as 25% of their holdings. As of October 13, Zillow shares had closed above $26.66 for, coincidentally, 20 of the prior 30 trading days. It’s worth mentioning that when Google went public seven years ago, they too had a similar, accelerated lock-up schedule. Yet that didn’t prevent the stock from climbing sharply from its $85 IPO price and more than tripling in its first year, without declining materially during that period.Bottom line: With a float that represents only 19% of Zillow’s total shares outstanding, even modest selling by un-locked insiders is likely to hinder appreciation in Zillow’s stock price, by increasing the effective trading supply. If, however, sustained selling doesn’t seem to have any effect, this would be hugely positive for Zillow, representing as it does, “shadow demand” for Zillow shares.2. Churn: Zillow hasn’t revealed its churn rates for its premier subscribers. It’s our experience with other subscription-based business models that suggested contract lengths are usually slightly greater than that implied by the churn rate. With contract lengths at a suggested 6-12 month period, we estimate that typical subscriber duration is 10-12 months. This is very short, and means that Zillow may “burn through” subscribers very quickly. 3. The Lawsuits: Zillow is being sued (separately) by Smarter Agent LLC, Corelogic and Lending Tree over various IP issues. In each case, Zillow has filed counterclaims. Zillow does not appear to have accrued against potential damages. Our gut feel: these are business process patents that will either be found invalid on re-examination, or the intellectual property will be cross-licensed.Competitive LandscapeZillow is the largest independent real estate market site, as measured by homes in its database and unique visitors to its web site. However, they do not yet have a dominant position. Realtor.com, Trulia, Homes.com and a variety of other sites all have meaningful market share and listing information. Trulia.com for example, has about 90% of Zillow’s traffic and is growing faster, year-over-year.One of the reasons we believe that Zillow is a Desired Monopoly, however, is that the site seems to reflect a Web 2.0 ethos: from the visual presentation to the emphasis on community via forums and agent reviews, Zillow.com simply feels more welcoming and less commercial.ValuationAs part of our analysis of Zillow, we built a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for the company. We used the following parameters and values to arrive at our DCF value: Using these inputs, our calculated DCF value per Zillow share is $42.30, about 60% higher than the current Zillow share price of around $26. But realistically, this estimate is mostly sensitive to the near-term cash flow growth, which, while conservatively estimated, is very uncertain.By comparison, we estimate that Zillow’s 2012 pro forma net income per share will be $0.50, meaning the company has a forward P:E of 50. Not cheap, but given current triple-digit growth rates, not expensive either. Right now, it’s fair to describe Zillow’s valuation as, “a premium price for a premium opportunity.”ConclusionBeyond overcoming realtor antipathy, Zillow is also impressive for having demonstrated explosive growth during perhaps the worst real estate market in the past 70 years. From April of 2006 until this past July, the Case-Schiller 20-city home price index declined by 32%. By comparison, the S&P 500 declined only 7% over that same period. Which makes it all the more amazing that a company whose sole product is real estate information could go from $0 in revenue in 2005 to an annualized rate of $64m today. You’re left to imagine how well they would have done in a real estate market that was at least flat. Or up.We feel strongly that Zillow is not only emerging as a Desired Monopoly for real estate information, but also as a platform for understanding one’s physical environment. As a company, Zillow has an immense opportunity. As a stock, with the forthcoming unlocking of shares, and multiple competitors that are far from vanquished, we feel less certain about Zillow’s near-term prospects. But of course we can’t help watching ...Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Zillow revealed record revenues of $15.8 million in the second quarter, up 116% year-over-year. Net Income for the quarter came in at $1.6 million, compared to a net loss of $2 million in the same period a year ago and a net loss of $0.8 in the first quarter of 2011. This quarter marked the company’s first quarter of GAAP profitabilityZillow saw record Marketplace Revenues of $9.7 million, up 269% year-over-year. Premier Agent subscribers, which contribute to Marketplace revenues, totaled 13,385 at June 30, 2011, up 180% from 4,777 at the end of the second quarter of 2010. Display revenues increased 30% to $6.1 million from $4.7 million in the second quarter of 2010.The company’s average monthly unique users grew 93% to a record 20.8 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared to 10.8 million average monthly unique users for the same period in 2010. And July 2011 marked another record traffic month with 23.2 million unique users to Zillow’s websites and mobile applications, a 98% increase from July 2010.Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff said of the company’s first earnings as a public company: “The second quarter was outstanding for Zillow with record revenues, traffic and mobile usage. It marks our first profitable quarter on a GAAP net income basis and our fourth consecutive profitable quarter on an Adjusted EBITDA basis..We’re extremely pleased with our progress and rapid growth, yet we believe we’ve only scratched the surface of our opportunity.”Profitability for the company is a big deal considering that while revenues were growing for Zillow, the company had been taking a loss each quarter for the past three years.Zillow, which initially filed its S-1 in April, currently lists over 100 million U.S. homes, including homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market. Zillow launched a mortgage marketplace in 2008, and subsequently expanded into  rentals and mobile. According to Experian Hitwise, Zillow.com is the third most visited Real Estate site in the U.S and received 5.36% of Real Estate visits in March 2011, which is a 53% increase compared to March 2010.Original post"

The deal came at an initial offering price of $20 per share, which was above the expected range of $16-18 a share -- itself up from the original estimate of $12 per share. The offering was a small one of just 3.5 million shares, so it is easy to understand how the offering was over-subscribed. As everyone knows, the stock opened at $60 before closing the day at $35.77, up 79%.Some of the attraction was because of pent-up demand for social media stocks. When we think “social media,” we think Facebook. While there probably is no uniformly accepted definition of a “social media” stock, to paraphrase Justice Potter Stewart, “We know it when we see it,” and Zillow is in no way a social media company. Zillow is a real estate information company that can be viewed as a derivative play on the residential real estate market. Knowing how moribund the general residential real estate market is nationally, we have a difficult time extrapolating optimistic growth rates far out into the future in a vain attempt to justify the $1 billion value currently assigned to the company. Please keep in mind that Zillow’s 2010 revenue was only approximately $30 million, thereby making the market cap over 30 times revenues (not earnings, of which there are none) on the initial day of trading.Everything about this stock feels wrong – even its stock symbol. How did Zillow manage to score a coveted one-letter moniker? Without reminiscing too much, we remember when one-letter symbols were reserved for the great icons of American industry. We were rendered speechless when Pandora scored its one-letter symbol; now we simply don’t know what to think. Certainly this has to be a historical first in awarding a one-letter symbol to a money-losing quasi-start-up with annual revenues of only $30 million. It would be difficult to lower the bar after this decision.At any rate, Zillow has racked up close to $80 million in losses since 2004. Some are actually calling Zillow a growth company, as year over year revenues are currently increasing at a healthy clip. We dismiss such claims by pointing to the small base and question the sustainability. We would remind all that Zillow’s revenue primarily comes from the sale of display ads to real estate agents and mortgage lenders. While we have no hard figures on overall spending in the real estate-related advertising market, it is intuitive to us simply by looking at the shrunken size of the real estate/housing section of our local Sunday newspaper that this market is not healthy.If Zillow was one of the houses that it supplies information on, we would have to say it would be a candidate for a “short sale” as soon as the 40-day cooling off period expires and the underwriters, like lemmings, come out with their inevitable buy recommendations. Another long term negative in our mind is that, although insiders did not sell into the IPO, they control approximately 87% of the outstanding stock. This we view as a huge dark cloud overhanging the stock, as some of that 87% eventually is dribbled into the market after “lockups” expire, either through open market sales or future secondaries. After an artificial boost to the stock price from the anticipated recommendations, we would expect the stock to drift downward. We would further point out that the Zillow IPO had a rather unusual provision that could reduce the standard 180-day lockup period in half for some of the insider stock so long as the share price stays above $25 per share.In summary, we do not think Zillow deserves the lofty valuation of a “social media” stock; rather, we look at the company merely as a second derivative play on a very sick and anemic housing market that shows little in the way of near term recovery. If and when we see housing recovering, we think the leading homebuilders will provide a more focused and leveraged play on the residential real estate market. We would look to exit any positions immediately after any uptick that might result from upcoming  “mandatory” underwriters' recommendations.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
280930,24114,2011-07-21T16:02:34-04:00,,"By Matthew KlosterAnother tech company riding the large technology IPO trend hit the market yesterday and results, while impressive, did not shock a lot of people. Zillow Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) is a real estate website that lists over 100 million homes for sale or rent. They also have a formula for estimating the actual value of houses to give consumers a good idea of what the actual value of the house is given current market prices. They hit the market like other companies such as LinkedIn (LNKD) and Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) and had the prices skyrocket over the first day of trading starting at $60, three times the IPO price of $20. The price, however, dropped back down to $35.77 by the end of the day which is still 78.9% above the IPO price. The last trade price of $35.77 values the company around $950 million, which, while high, is a lot less than the $1.6M it was valued at early in the day. Shockingly, this all comes from a company that has never made a profit in its history, last year experienced a loss of $6.8M. The whole purpose of the company is to sell homes even though the rate of people are buying homes is the weakest in over 14 years, so why are people so eager to get a piece of this stock? While the company has never seen a profit, it is growing at an incredible rate. The loss in the past quarter was only $826,000 compared to the $2.8M in the same quarter the previous year, and revenue growth grew 74% in 2010 to $30.5M. Also, its unique user count in May was 22 million which is double the number from last May. One main reason investors are going crazy for this stock seems to be the double digit growth even in a slow, flat economy especially since the market it is targeting is currently doing terrible. This leaves a lot of room for more growth when the economy picks up and people start buying more homes.Advertising is the only real source of revenue for this company, which means the more viewers the more money. Twice as many people are already visiting the site compared to last year and the noise from the IPO will only bolster that number. Not all tech IPOs have sustained such high prices after a big increase on the first day such as Pandora (NYSE:P) which is trading at only 10% above IPO price. Skullcandy (NASDAQ:SKUL) also had its IPO recently and the price has stayed relatively the same. The difference with Zillow seems to be hitting an untapped market. Everything these days is becoming web based from the way we communicate to the way we buy goods, so why not real estate? This site has taken the idea of many other companies and applied it to a different market with great success. Luckily for them, investors seem to be drawn to anything that is web and app based which gave rise to the perfect time for an IPO and allowed them to raise a total of over 74M. The great growth over the past year even in a troubled market and the capability for large future growth has most people excited about this stock. Should the company be valued at $1.6 billion or even $950 million, probably not, but growth prospects shed a gleaming light on the company which should continue to grow over the next few years. I am not convinced on buying this company now, but keeping a close eye on it over the next month may lead to a future purchase.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
555091,22762,2012-05-03T10:17:10-04:00,,"By Leena RaoReal estate listings site Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) just reported strong Q1 earnings. The company reported record revenue of $22.8 million, up 103% over first quarter 2011. Net Income came in at $1.7 million, resulting in EPS of $0.06. Analysts expected earnings of $0.03 per share on revenue of $21.5 million.Zillow is also buying rental marketing software maker RentJuice, as we reported earlier this year. The transaction is all-cash, valued at $40 million.“Mobile usage and site traffic grew substantially during the first quarter, which led to record revenue and EBITDA levels exceeding our prior outlook, and our sixth consecutive quarter of triple-digit, year-over-year revenue growth,” said CEO Spencer Rascoff in a release.“We continue to expand our addressable market and competitive advantage as we extend our mobile leadership, launch more services for real estate professionals, and grow our mortgage and rentals marketplaces. In particular, we took a giant leap forward in growing our rentals marketplace with today’s announcement that Zillow is acquiring RentJuice. This acquisition will provide us with a comprehensive suite of business and marketing services for rental professionals, similar to what took us years to build and grow in our parallel marketplace for real estate agents.”The company says average monthly unique users grew 84% to 31.8 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 17.3 million average monthly unique users for the same period in 2011. And Zillow usage on mobile devices continues to grow. For the first time, more homes each month are now viewed via Zillow on mobile devices than on the Web. In March 2012, 155 million homes were viewed on Zillow Mobile, or 57 homes per second.Zillow recently launched its first dedicated rentals app, debuting on Android.Zillow’s revenue for the second quarter is also expected to reach record levels of $25.5 to $26.5 million.Original post"
280913,24382,2011-07-21T15:30:21-04:00,,"I first started covering the lofty valuations in certain subsectors of technology on May 2, where I described it as a localized bubble.  In a follow-up article on July 1, I reexamined the companies on the original list and discussed their relatively poor performance along with the arrival of new IPOs that would have made the original list.  With each new tech IPO, though, it seems that investors are behaving more and more irrationally.  While I cannot say for certain that we are at the peak of the bubble (1999-ish) instead of the beginning (1996-97-ish), I believe the long term outlook for shares in aggregate is highly negative even though they represent ownership interests in compelling (mostly) well-run businesses.  Why?  Because valuation matters.Let's look at Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) in more detail.  With $30.5M of 2010 revenue and a net loss of $6.7M, the company is being valued in excess of $1B.  That represents a multiple of more than 33x trailing revenue for a relatively small, unprofitable, cyclical, advertising-supported business.  While we may be closer to the bottom of the cycle than the top, in terms of volume of real estate transactions, one still must wonder how long it will take (if ever) for Zillow to grow into its massive large-cap valuation.  ZipRealty (NASDAQ:ZIPR), another publicly traded Internet company with exposure to the real estate market, is currently trading at an EV/revenue ratio of ~0.33x.  Yes, that unprofitable company is valued at one-third of trailing revenue even though it has ~4x as much revenue as Zillow and more than 1.5x as much gross margin as Zillow has revenue.  Nevertheless, ZipRealty has a market cap of only ~$64M while Zillow is valued at over $1B.  According to Quantcast, ZipRealty has ~1/4 the traffic as Zillow, yet its market cap is ~1/15 of Zillow and its enterprise value is even lower relative to the recent IPO.The vast difference in valuation between a recent tech IPO and similar publicly traded competitors is not limited to Zillow.  Pandora's (NYSE:P) nearly $3B market cap for an unprofitable ~$200M revenue run-rate business (based on Q1 2011 numbers) whose margins will always be challenged by music royalties is almost as shocking as Zillow's valuation.  But if you look at the multiples of revenue commanded by Atrinsic (NASDAQ:ATRN), the parent company of the Kazaa music streaming service (EV/revenue of 0.5x) or RealNetworks (NASDAQ:RNWK), a part owner (with MTV Networks) of the parent company of the Rhapsody music streaming service (EV/revenue of 0.42x on over $401M of revenue), you have to wonder what Pandora investors are thinking.It would seem that the dumb money is chasing novelty as it relates to their investments in the same way as they chase novelty at retail.  In some respects, paying a relative price of 10+x times as much for the latest tech IPO instead of a close competitor is arguably no different than spending 10x as much on this year's designer handbag instead of last year's closeout.  But while fashion-conscious shoppers will have temporary bragging rights by owning a stylish new accessory, it is the value-conscious investor who will have bragging rights by having superior investment returns.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
280748,24318,2011-07-21T11:56:52-04:00,,"Congratulations to everyone who got in on the Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) IPO, you made a killing! Now for almost everyone else who bought today “ouch.” Today Zillow looked dead on arrival in the secondary market. In case anyone missed it, Zillow initially doubled based off the IPO price, but then immediately took a crash course to lower levels.Click on image below to enlarge.What everyone wants to know now is whether this is going to look more like another Pandora (NYSE:P) or LinkedIn (LNKD) trading environment. In our view, Zillow has a murky future although the markets would suggest otherwise given its stock price didn’t retrace to IPO pricing levels.Zillow might be the most interesting Internet company of three companies mentioned. This deals with the fact that Zillow has actually achieved profitability like LinkedIn, but has simultaneously warned that it could become unprofitable again as the business matures. We can imagine at this point whomever bought Zillow today might be saying, “I didn’t hear about this anywhere” and ask where our proof is.*Source: TechCrunchYou can check out this snippet of news on TechCrunch. It looks like they found this on the S-1 filing for the company. Before anyone has a heart attack, though notice the key word “may”, meaning that there is no guarantee this will occur. Still, it seems like more than a few people either glossed over this reference or just weren’t made aware of it because we haven’ t heard any chatter on the topic. Now we rate Zillow a PASS due to the fact that the firm focuses on the US real estate market, has already warned that its ability to remain profitable is serious enough that the potential was referenced, the lending market remains tight, and because the US unemployment rate remains high.US Real Estate! Are You Kidding Me?Any wealthy investor with a lot of liquidity that has gone after US real estate is probably making a killing given the steep discounts. Now let’s realize this doesn’t describe the vast majority of Americans. Most Americans have been struggling just to keep their jobs, pay their mortgage, and maintain their way of life. In addition, US real estate as a whole has continued to remain weak years after the bubble, with only a few prime areas doing better now. So before everyone starts drinking the real estate cool aid again let’s all remember that this arena currently remains bleak.Now, some people are going to point out that traffic to the site has continually increased which illustrates promise. Rising traffic is great but most people can’t afford to buy a home period. Zillow, in our view, is the ultimate window-shopping site. Sure plenty of people want to buy a home, point in case why they go to Zillow, but they haven’t and real estate prices illustrate this.Going Public Because They Can In another time and place Zillow would actually be an IPO we like. Now, what might this world look like, you ask? To start, the official US unemployment rate wouldn’t be hovering at 9.2% and the US economy wouldn’t be digging itself out of an economic crater. Also, the US real estate wouldn’t have just collapsed nationwide and still be in a slump. Basically we would have liked it to go public at any other time when the US economy wasn’t facing such a massive amount of real and perceived head wind.In our view, Zillow IPO’d for only two real reasons. First, they made it public that once the firm was profitable they would be interested in this route. The other reason is that right now Internet IPOs have been hotter than an exploding hot potato. In other words, they knew they could fleece investors in a hot IPO market and they did. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that investors can’t get enough exposure to “Web 2.0” companies. Also, we doubt the backers of Zillow planned on keeping the company private for this long so while the sun shines they’ll make hay.Great Idea, but Horrible Timing In 2008 Zillow launched a mortgage market place at pretty much the peak/end of the real estate bubble. Great idea but horrible timing obviously. Now, we still think this was one of the best things Zillow did, but the problem is the banks. They just aren’t lending actively to the average Joe. This is why we consistently hear about cash deals in the RE market now. We have little doubt this could be a huge money maker for the firm but an icy lending market just doesn’t help the firm.Conclusion:  If Zillow hadn’t come out at such a high premium we might have rated the firm a “buy.” Why? Well, if it had come out at a fair valuation we could see this as a long term recovery play for the US economy and real estate market overall. We can’t do that though given the huge “internet” premium being priced in and the fact that earnings expectations will now be much tougher to surpass. Now, if Zillow goes down around $20 a share or lower we’ll take another look at the situation and reevaluate, but while it trades at $30+ we think the name is a PASS.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
280852,24114,2011-07-21T13:33:33-04:00,,"By Lucas ScholhamerIn its initial public offering, real estate website Zillow, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) has become the latest in a string of high-profile internet companies to open public trading with a bang this year.   The Seattle-based company set an opening price of $20, and shares have currently settled around $39.00, a 95% increase, after reaching upwards of $60 early on.  Zillow chose to limit its offering to just 3.5 million shares in an attempt to maintain a high level of demand for its limited stock, a common move more recently seen in the IPOs of LinkedIn (LNKD) and Pandora Media (NYSE:P).  The website, which uses automated formulas and publicly available information to calculate and superimpose home values on a satellite map, does not seem to be suffering from the nation’s sluggish housing market.The high volatility of recent internet IPOs sheds little light on the potential sustainability of today’s gains for Zillow.  In May, social-networking site LinkedIn closed its first day of trading up 109% and shares now stand at 117% above its IPO price.  On the other hand, Pandora also had a strong opening but has fluctuated greatly on the way to its current price of $17.80, an 11.24% gain.  Although it is uncertain whether or not Zillow, Inc., a company that has never turned a profit, is actually worth in excess of $1 billion, CEO Spencer Raskoff has helped lead Hotwire.com and Expedia Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) to significant success in the past, and his track record bodes well for the company. All in all, I believe Zillow offers a unique product and a strong management team at a time when finding innovative ways to expand the use of the internet is almost a sure-fire formula for success.  However, the unpredictability of this and similar website IPOs will keep me out for now.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
280850,22192,2011-07-21T13:31:03-04:00,,"With Wall Street Journal headlines like ""Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) Zooms 79% in IPO,"" I'm wondering to myself, ""Who on earth is dumb enough to buy and hold this stuff long-term?"" What's even more outlandish in my opinion is that a company that isn't even profitable gets a single letter ticker symbol, which is effectively the holy grail of ticker symbols.Reasons you should sell:1. Not profitable. After crunching the numbers, as I have addressed before, Zillow is not profitable and is trading at a market cap of over $1B. The CEO spins this as cash flow positive.2. 13% of the company was sold, so let's be honest -- this isn't a public company. It's still very much privately held considering that existing investors are taking a larger stake according to the CEO. These sliver deals are supporting abnormally higher prices.3. This is what you would call a poorly-sized deal. What you have is a market for consumer Internet companies that greatly overwhelms supply as a whole. The net result of this is that lots of these types of companies are lining up to be sold. This is a repeat of the tech bubble of 2001. Effectively what you have is companies selling small portions of themselves at high prices and the market not having enough shares to trade given the quantity of dumb money that wants to invest in these types of companies. The market drives up the prices as investors fight over a small quantity of shares. For example, if you have $10B of dumb money chasing what is intrinsically worth $1B in freely tradable shares, market capitalizations do not matter in the short term. Valuations will rock higher until shorts are able to get involved and as long as the floats remain small, the shorts can get squeezed out. This trend will persist until the dumb money starts to get overwhelmed with share supply, which naturally will happen but takes time. Signs of this inevitability are that Zynga and Facebook intend to go public. If it was me, I'd sell my entire stake of anything in this sector given my perception that discounting the cash flows; you've got to be nuts to be a buyer.When demand is hot, returns are not. If you are looking to buy and hold this for 10 years, you've got to be nuts. This entire sector is overvalued. Sell the stupidity if you own it and if you don't own it, let the stupidity perhaps drive it even higher and then let's profit from a short together. If I was anyone who could sell shares or sell my stake, I'd be selling out ASAP.

280587,24419,2011-07-20T15:58:14-04:00,,"On July 19, after Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) priced its initial public offering at $20 per share, I wrote an article arguing that the valuation at $20 per share was a full valuation. When Zillow started trading on July 20, the stock traded up above $35 per share, where it has a market capitalization of over $1.1 billion and an enterprise value of approximately $1.05 billion.  Remember that this is a company that only generated $30.5mm in revenue in 2010.  Therefore, the current valuation represents almost 35x 2010 revenue.  If we assume revenue grows at 100% in 2011 and 2012, 2012 revenue would still represent over 8.5x revenue.  If it grows another 100% in 2013, the multiple falls to a still loft 4.3x revenue.  Said another way, investors think the company is going to have incredible growth or they think/hope that other investors will think that the company is going to have incredible growth.The potential EBITDA generation given the 100% growth three-year scenario discussed above and a 30% EBITDA margin in 2013 results in 2013 EBITDA of almost $75mm, which implies an enterprise value to EBITDA multiple of 14.3x.  I agree that Zillow is a useful tool when house or apartment hunting, especially via a mobile device.  Further, at some point in the next few years the U.S. real estate market will pick up.  But even today when people are not buying houses, they are still renting -- so how much additional revenue will the company generate from a revitalized U.S. housing market?  Zillow offered 3.5 million shares in its IPO (which could increase to 4 million if the underwriters exercise the greenshoe, which they will likely exercise) out of a total share count of 27.5 million.  This means Zillow only offered 12.7% of the shares to the public.  Often IPOs offer between 20 and 30%.  As a result, the scarcity value could be driving some of the price increase we are seeing today.  Since no insiders sold in the offering, there will likely be a follow-on offering when lock-up expires, especially if the price stays at such a lofty valuation.At these levels, I believe Zillow is over-valued.  Anyone considering an investment should carefully read the risk factors in the IPO prospectus and consider the valuation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Winners? Those institutions given the shares at $20 who can flip to the retail crowd. Great to be 'smart money'.This morning the company was valued at some $1 Billion plus, for annualized revenue of $45Mish.

Z provides vital information about homes, real estate listings and mortgages through the Zillow website and mobile applications, enabling homeowners, buyers, sellers and renters to connect with real estate and mortgage professionals best suited to meet their needs. Z believes it is transforming the way consumers make home-related decisions.In December 2010, Z began collecting and displaying consumer-generated real estate agent ratings and reviews. By June 9, 2011, consumers had submitted more than 50,000 agent reviews published by Zillow. In February 2011, Z launched the strategic relationship with Yahoo Real Estate.Z’s living database covers more than 100 million U.S. homes – for sale, for rent and not currently on the market.  Individuals and businesses that use Zillow have updated information on more than 28 million homes and added more than 60 million home photos, creating exclusive home profiles available nowhere else.  These profiles include rich detailed information about homes, including property facts, listing information and purchase and sale data.Zillow provides this information to users where, when and how they want it, both through Zillow’s website and through industry-leading mobile applications that enable consumers to access information when they are curbside, viewing homes. Using industry-leading automated valuation models, Zillow provides current home value estimates, or Zestimates, on nearly 100 million U.S. homes, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on nearly 100 million U.S. homes.Zillow believes its products and services present residential real estate data in novel ways that have revolutionized the way consumers search for, find and understand home-related information and make real estate decisions.Zillow generates revenues from local real estate professionals, primarily on an individual subscription basis, and from mortgage professionals and brand advertisers. Z’s revenues include marketplace revenues, consisting of subscriptions sold to real estate agents and advertising sold on a cost per click, or CPC, basis to mortgage lenders, and  display revenues from advertising placements sold primarily on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis.Zillow generates revenue growth from three sources.  •  Traffic to Z’s website and mobile applications, indicated by the average number of monthly unique users for the three months ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, of 5.5 million, 7.6 million and 12.7 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 48%, 38% and 66%, respectively. •  Marketplace revenues, due to the launch of Z’s Premier Agent program in 2008 and the commencement of charging mortgage lenders for participation in Zillow Mortgage Marketplace in January 2010. Pricing for the Premier Agent subscriptions varies by zip code. Typical terms of Premier Agent subscription contracts range from six to 12 months.   Growth in Z’s subscription advertising product is based on Z’s ability to continue to attract agent subscribers and drive consumer traffic to those agents on Z’s website and through Z’s mobile applications. •  Display revenues, resulting from traffic growth and improved productivity of Z’s sales force.During the three months ended March 31, Z generated revenue of $11.3 million, compared to $5.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2010, an increase of 111%.  Z believes this increase is primarily the result of an increase in its Premier Agent Subscribers from 3,438 at March 31, 2010 to 10,710 at March 31, 2011, as well as a significant growth in traffic to Z’s website and mobile applications.There were approximately 17.3 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to 9.3 million average monthly unique users for the three months ended March 31, 2010, representing year-over-year growth of 86%.Z anticipates the Yahoo partnership will have a positive impact on future results of operations, primarily due to an increase in marketplace revenues.  Z expects the partnership will continue to drive greater demand for Z’s Premier Agent product.In 2008, real estate brokers and sales agents held about 517,800 jobs; real estate sales agents held approximately 76 percent of these jobs. (Source: US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition.)In April 2008, Z launched Zillow Mortgage Marketplace.

280351,24419,2011-07-19T22:50:29-04:00,,"Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) priced its IPO after the market closed on July 19 at $20 per share.  This price equates to a fully diluted market capitalization of over $630mm.Zillow, according to its IPO prospectus, is a “leading real estate information marketplace.”  The prospectus goes on to suggest that Zillow uses complex, proprietary automated valuation models to provide current home value estimates on nearly 100 million U.S. homes, and current rental price estimates on nearly 100 million U.S. homes.The company generates revenue from three sources.  First, real estate professionals subscribe to Zillow’s Premier Agent program, which helps them get additional traffic to their listings.  Second, mortgage professionals pay in order to participate in Zillow’s mortgage marketplace.  Finally, like most online business Zillow generates advertising revenue through display ads.Zillow has grown revenue from $10.6mm in 2008 to $30.5mm in 2010, an annualized growth rate of almost 70%.To test its valuation let’s assume that the company can maintain a 75% top-line growth rate through 2013.  Further, let’s assume that Zillow achieves an EBITDA margin of 30% in 2013 (the company had an EBITDA of margin of 9.3% in the first quarter of 2011).  This results in 2013 EBITDA of almost $50mm.  Applying a multiple of 15x results in an enterprise value of approximately $735mm, a market capitalization of $850mm, and a 2013 share price of approximately $25.60 per share (30% above the IPO price of $20).  However, this $25.60 is reflective of the company over two years from now and needs to be discounted back to today.  Assuming an admittedly arbitrary 25% discount rate to account for the risk inherent in 75% annual top-line growth results in a valuation of approximately $16.60 per share, over 15% below the IPO price.  This analysis is highly sensitive to the multiple assumptions used including the revenue growth rate, EBITDA margin, and discount rate.  If we backwards engineer the math we find that a discount rate of 13% (holding the other assumptions constant) would equate our valuation with the IPO price.  The question,   in the context of this type of approximate analysis, then becomes: Does a 13% discount rate accurately reflect the risks inherent in Zillow’s ability to grow revenue at 75% per year while improving EBITDA margins from 9% to 30%?  This rate feels too low to me given the current state of the real estate market and the general economic conditions, leading me to conclude that Zillow, at its IPO price, is fully valued.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Zillow is one of  seven IPOs scheduled to price this week on the U.S. IPO calendar.Background  Zillow was developed by the founders of Expedia.com who sought to  translate their success in aggregating travel data for consumer  convenience into a new offering designed to similarly transform the real  estate market. The name ""Zillow"" stems from the founding idea of  providing zillions of data points for U.S. properties, even those that are  not currently listed. Currently, the company maintains data and  property estimates (""Zestimates"") on over 100 million U.S. home and rental  properties, of which 28 million have been updated by individuals and  real estate agents.   The company generates revenue from three different business segments.  The company offers advertisers targeted ad space, allowing the  advertisers to identify customers by zip code, price range or even  acreage of the properties they browse. Zillow's premiere agent  subscription is a fee based service for real estate agents and brokers  with over 10,000 subscribers to date. The agents purchase a contract to  receive prime advertising space with rates varying by zip code and  property prices. Finally, Zillow recently rolled out its  ""Mortgage Marketplace."" This service for lenders allows users to  anonymously receive a personalized indicative rate on a mortgage, with  Zillow receiving a fee for hosting the lender in the Marketplace. Zillow  reports that 22 million unique users visited the website and mobile  application in May 2011.Financials  Zillow generated $30 million in sales (43% marketplace revenue, 57%  million display advertising) in 2010, representing a 74% increase from  $17 million in the prior year period. For the fiscal 1Q ended March,  sales grew 111% to $11 million as a result of a 271% increase in  marketplace revenue to 6.9 million and a 26% increase in display revenue  to 4.4 million. Unique visitors were up 86% to 17.3 million and premier  agent subscriptions grew 212% to 10,700. Operating losses narrowed as  the company approached profitability. The company expected to post  operating profits in 2012 while targeting operating margins in excess of  20% in the long term.RisksZillow adheres to a different model than most online real estate sites.  By offering an expansive database of real estate information, Zillow  seeks to drive its business by attracting site traffic from individual  buyers, sellers and renters for whom the site is free to use. However,  Zillow must balance the pursuit of non-paying visitors without  compromising its paying base of agents and brokers. The company  depends on these agents and brokers for content and subscription  revenue, but the aggregation of data and provision of Zestimates often  rankles the agents who may believe that these Zestimates distort  reasonable expectations by potential clients. There are numerous  competitive websites, such as Realtor.com and other affiliated sites  operated by Move, Inc. (14.5 million monthly visitors). The Zillow IP  may be damaged by site copycats and data ""scrapers"" attempting to  replicate Zillow's findings and estimates. Also, continued deterioration  of the real estate market could cause real estate agents to drop their  subscriptions.OutlookZillow's model has seen success thus far in attracting site traffic and  real estate agent subscribers. The continued growth of the user base  provides valuable information for Zillow's viewer database and property  valuation algorithms as owners and brokers update information on their  properties. With less than 1% of total real estate agents as current  subscribers, Zillow seems well positioned to expand its subscription  service in its addressable market of 1.8 million brokers and agents.  Managing the value offered to non-paying visitors and real estate  clientele is the key concern for this story, the correct mix may  determine the continued viability of the marketplace revenue model. To  date, Zillow has balanced these competing interests and expects to  expand its business through its newer offerings such as the mortgage  market, mobile application proliferation and increased penetration of  the online real estate market.

Zillow’s price range will start at $12 to $14 per share, giving the  company a $378 million valuation. The company aims to raise as much as  $55.7 million in the IPO. Zillow will begin trading under the symbol “Z”  on Nasdaq.Zillow, which initially filed its S-1  in April, currently lists over 100 million U.S. homes, including  homes  for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market. Zillow launched a mortgage marketplace in 2008, and subsequently expanded into  rentals and mobile.The company’s traffic to its web and mobile sites is up 100% year-over-year and in May 2011, Zillow was used on a mobile device more  than 8.8 million times, with more than 1.7 million homes viewed on  mobile devices each day.For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, the company  generated revenues of $10.6 million, $17.5 million and $30.5 million,  representing year-over-year growth of 49%, 65% and 74%, respectively.  And during the three months ended March 31, 2011, Zillow generated  revenue of $11.3 million, as compared to $5.3 million in the three  months ended March 31, 2010, an increase of 111%. Unfortunately, in  terms of income, Zillow has been taking a loss for the past three years.The company lost $12.8 million in 2009, and lost roughly half of that  ($6.7 million) in 2010. The company, which launched to the public in  2006, also revealed that as of December 31, 2010,  it has an accumulated  deficit of $78.7 million.

Some tech companies like HomeAway (NYSEARCA:AWAY-OLD), Fusion-IO (NYSE:FIO) and Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) have  seen steady share values,while  Pandora (NYSE:P) and LinkedIn (LNKD) saw huge fluctuations in share price.

884951,32101,2012-09-24T13:21:55-04:00,,"Trulia (TRLA), founded 2005, is a real estate data-aggregation web site. Naturally, it has corresponding mobile applications accessible form smartphones. Trulia's IPO was this past Thursday, September 20th, and it was a tremendous success with shares trading up some 40% immediately. The implication of the share price is that Trulia is worth more than half a billion dollars:Given its annual revenue of only $38.5 million in 2011 (or $1.45 a share), and its annualized 2012 revenue of $58 million (or $2.19 a share), its price to sales ratio will likely end this year around 10 to 16 times.That means we can derive the following conclusion regarding current prices: If Trulia achieves a large 10% profit margin this year (not on track for that, however), then it would have a P/E in the range of 100 to 160; alternatively put, it would have an earnings yield of 0.6% to 1%.If we throw its growth rates into a table, we can see that even if it continue to grow, and if it achieved a profitability of 10% next year, it would still be considered overvalued for the next 4 to 5 years.Or if we only assumed it could achieve a 5% profit margin, the numbers would look even worse:It would take until 2018 for its P/E multiple to enter a normal range -- and that is assuming (1) revenue growth continues, (2) an increase in profitability and (3) no decline in share price.It seems to me that for this company to enter a more normal valuation, it would be easier for the share price to fall than for the company to grow into the valuation.Basically, it current price assumes a Herculean -- and successful -- effort in the future.Trulia - Content AggregatorTrulia aggregates and organizes real estate data from the web, from in public records, and from data generated by users -- the last of which numbers some 5 million user contributions. It also tracks previous sales history, and school locations; all in all, pretty useful stuff. Here are its operating statistics, all positive:Trulia's 22,030,000 unique user count is behind Zillows (NASDAQ:Z) figure of ""33.5 million average monthly unique users"" (see Zillow Q2 10-Q, p. 15).Over the six month period ending June 30th, it had 360,000 active real estate professionals on the site, and importantly, 21,544 paying subscribers. The last, of course, is where Trulia generates most of its revenue:Its subscription revenue has steadily increased as a percentage of total revenue: from 32% in 2009 to 68% in 2011. Recurring subscription revenue is a huge positive from a cash flow perspective. Unfortunately, Trulia goes on to say that it does not focus on the renewal rate -- which it calls misleading due to seasonality. Trulia may be right, but one would think that maintaining a high renewal rate would be a big priority.Now according to Trulia, there are 2.8 million real estate professionals in the United States -- those professionals make up the market which Trulia seeks to tap. I'd point out, real quick, that means that 0.89% of the U.S. population sells real estate -- a number which seemed a little high. Upon looking it up, the National Association of Realtors puts the figure at 1.2 million, and the Department of Labor puts the number at 500,000. Skepticism aside, new housing starts are picking up in the united states:US Housing Starts (Unadjusted) data by YChartsIf history is any guide about the normal level of housing starts, then it appears that the housing market has more room to move upward than it does downward. Such an increase in housing starts would theoretically be a boon for Trulia (and Zillow).The Online Real Estate Space Is (Very) CrowdedCompetition is hazardous for all business, so let us list the players within the ""online data aggregation of real estate information"" business:Within this competitive context, Trulia lays out its market vision:So there is, in theory, money to be made within this segment. But given all the players within this market already -- and specifically, with the profitable Zillow -- the wise words of Warren Buffett echo in my ear:How do you pick one winner out of 15?ZillowAnd as I noted, Zillow is its main rival. For instance in Trulia's S-1, it states:That is one of the difficulties with internet companies. Setting up the database and getting the user interface is not the hard part. Getting chosen by hordes of users is what makes a social site work. And a 50% rate, for me, does not quite qualify as a competitive advantage.ConclusionWhenever a company does not have a history of earnings or free-cash-flow [1], the investment becomes immediately speculative by definition. As Trulia itself says on page 13 of its prospectus:For me, with a whole universe of profitable companies, why speculate? In Security Analysis, and under a paragraph segmented with the title ""Speculation Characterized by Future Prospects,"" Ben Graham writes:If we take heed, and if we consider the preservation of our capital as a goal logically prior to the goal of achieving an appropriate return, then we ought to avoid investments which are clearly speculative. There is no margin-of-safety here.The future may work out brilliantly for Trulia, or the speculator could make a few bucks off trading with a bigger fool, or, it is possible, one could lose their shirt. Either way, the past record does not suggest that current valuations will remain at present levels. It suggests, rather, that this untested business was able to fund its operations by selling a portion of its ownership at a good price (that is, a good price for the sellers).Notes:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

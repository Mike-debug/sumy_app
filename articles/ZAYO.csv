4262024,48311,2019-05-09T13:37:01-04:00,"In a previous article, I laid out why I didn't want to speculate on Zayo even though there were very specific rumors.Within weeks, Zayo gets bought out albeit at a slightly lower price than rumored.Perhaps Zayo couldn't get the buyers to $36.5 because they are the only two, and the acquisition is very large compared to these fund sizes.There is a 5.71% spread, is that a worthy playing?","Zayo (ZAYO) finally had a deal materialize. Global investment firms EQT and Digital Colony are buying it for $35 a share. That's below the latest communicated range of $36.50-38.50. It is now trading at a ~5% spread to the takeout price or a ~7% annualized return if it is consummated early March 2020. The annualized return I've assigned may be a little bit conservative. More about that later.I avoided speculating on these takeout rumors a short while back and that call certainly has not worked out given the evidence of this transaction. I'll move on from that wrong call and try to assess whether it is time to get involved today objectively.A key variable in this deal is what date it will close. EQT is throwing this into the EQT Infrastructure IV fund. It is $9 billion in size and has been active since '18. I think that party should be able to close soon enough. Digital Colony is partly owned by Colony Capital (CLNY) and they commented on the venture on the recent earnings call:Zayo has a market cap of $7.7 billion and an enterprise value of $11 billion, so I'd say this is quite a large transaction for the acquiring funds. Perhaps the size of this buyout versus the size of the buying funds is the main concern here. From the newsflow, it also appears Omers and Stonepeak dropped out.I'm not sure why two buyout funds teaming up are projecting a closing date in H1 2020.Both parties have been involved in this deal process for a long time and they should know the target well by now. Regulatory clearance shouldn't be a problem since the parties are not strategic acquirers.The closing of the deal is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory clearance and Zayo shareholder approvals. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar 2020. In my previous write-up, I motivated myself to not speculate here like this:As recently as this year, the stock traded a hair above $20:The surge in share price year-to-date has brought its EV/EBITDA multiple up and compared to competitors it is richly valued at this take-out price:Data by YChartsIf this deal somehow breaks, there is quite a bit of downside risk. I think the deal is highly likely to close. My main concern is that the company is so big compared to the acquiring funds. The faraway closing date is also a slight concern. Lots of things can go wrong in such a long time. I also don't understand why two buyout funds (experienced in transactions) would need such a long time to close. If I put the closing date in early March, the annualized return of ~7% doesn't get me excited on a risk adjusted basis. If I assume, what I would think is more realistic, is a closing date around New Years, and the annualized return goes up to 10%. However, we only get those returns if it closes. Selling Zayo has taken forever and many parties dropped out. Ultimately, I still can't get comfortable with this risk/reward but that may change as time passes and the spread stays wide enough."
4255706,48311,2019-04-22T12:16:56-04:00,"There have been rumors about a Zayo sale at least since 2015.The latest rumors indicate a buyout within a week in the 36.50-$38.50Â range.The potential upside is attractive, but the risks seem manifold.Buy it or let this one go?","There have been M&A rumors surrounding Zayo (NYSE:ZAYO) at least going back to 2015 when Blackstone (BX), Stonepeak, KKR (KKR), I Squared, GTCR and Charlesbank Capital Partners were already floating around. Rumors have continued to circle the company and the latest ones by StreetInsider are that Digital Colony Partners, EQT and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners and the company will reach a deal in about a week from now. The price is rumored to be in the $36.50-$38.50 range. The market seems rather skeptical with the stock trading below $32:Data by YChartsAs recently as January, SA reported:Zayo has been put together through bolt-on acquisition after acquisition:Zayo's focus is on fiber assets. This extensive fiber network connects data centers, cell towers, and other enterprise assets:What isn't clear to me is what is special about Zayo's assets. Competitors like AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) own a lot of fiber as well. Because I've been working on the T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) merger, I fear the coming 5G turf war may also increase competition for fiber businesses. Worryingly, the company also reported elevated churn:Add to that, EBITDA has been growing strongly over its history (although lately EBITDA margin growth stalled out), but importantly, free cash flow did not really go anywhere:Data by YChartsIn terms of current valuation, both the surge in share price since early January and the EV/EBITDA multiple it trades at (and I could pick less favorable valuation metrics) shows the market is baking in the potential for an M&A event:Data by YChartsWhat I find attractive about the rumors is that there is a specific price target, potential buyers have names and numbers, and there is a 14%+ spread to the lower end of the rumored deal range. Positively, there are activists in this stock pushing for a sale. What I don't like is that there have been rumors surrounding this company forever. Potential buyers have been named in the past as well and somehow these have all gone away. I'm not comfortable with the valuation and how the fundamentals of the underlying business look.Ultimately, I'm not comfortable enough with the risks to own Zayo outright. I don't like its standalone prospects enough and I don't like how deep this can fall if no deal materializes. Finally, there is a risk these rumors just persist (as they've done so far) without anything materializing for a long time while your invested capital is dead money.However, I could see a Zayo position if you protect yourself with puts against larger downside scenarios. This will take away from the upside ROI, but if you can acquire out of the money puts cheaply enough, I could get comfortable with the complete risk profile."
4248114,101850,2019-03-12T14:06:50-04:00,"Zayo announced a reorganization plan merging the different vertical products of the network division and scrapped plans to separate into two public companies.Evident from the 2Q19 results that Zayo's core fundamentals improved as it recorded its second-best bookings as a result of reorganization efforts.The reorganization plan puts more focus on sales which will fuel its growth in the future.Potential buyout values the company's share in the $32-38 range, offers investors optionality.","Zayo Group (ZAYO) had a decent 2Q19 with revenues and EBITDA both meeting consensus while margins slightly beating consensus. These results were fueled by ZAYO recording its second-best ever net bookings as a result of its new organization plan. Also, the company stated that it will not look to separate the group into two separate public companies; instead, it will break up the enterprise business with parts going into the core network business, zColo business, and Allstream.Plus, there have been reports suggesting buyout offers from private equity firms, especially after the rejection of Blackstone's (NYSE:BX) $30/share offer, which implies a potential bid in the range of $32-38, due to its already high leverage (4.6x), could be made.We think the stock is compelling - successful reorg efforts are driving fundamental upside while the prospect of a buyout offers optionality for investors.ZAYO revenues for 2Q19 were almost in line with consensus reaching $639mn versus the consensus of $641mn despite still declining yoy and qoq by 2.2% and 1.2%, respectively. These revenues come at the back of a decline in all major segments except Network revenues which grew by 2% as a result of Other revenues of $8.9mn.The pickup in the net bookings driven primarily by a material step-up in bookings for zColo and Fiber solutions segments have lifted the EBITDA margins to reach 50.3% versus the consensus of 49.9%, representing a 44bps increase over 1Q19.At the same time, EPS came in line with consensus at $0.13 which represents massive increases from 2Q18 and 1Q19 of 160% and 177.8%, respectively.zColo revenues for 2Q19 continued to decline to reach $57.5mn versus $59mn in 1Q19 which represents a 3% decline. Similarly, Enterprise Networks and Allstream followed the same trend to record revenues of $81.6mn and $96.7mn, respectively, representing a 1% and 8% decline qoq, respectively. On the other hand, Fiber Solutions recorded a growth in revenues, qoq, to reach $228.7mn versus $220.9mn, a 4% increase; while Total Transport Services grew by 1% to reach $169.8mn.(Source: Author, Form 10-Q)ZAYO's management guided a 4-6% growth for its Network revenues which implies revenue of approximately $1.85bn for this segment. At the same time, zColo revenues will be flat which translates to a total of $2.2 billion of Communications Infrastructure revenue in FY19 which is in line with the current analysts' estimates.ZAYO announced that it would merge different vertical products of the network division into one unit which will create a better sales experience for customers and improve sales figures and the return on capital.Moreover, the company no longer intends to go ahead with its previously announced split plan into two public companies. Instead, the company intends to break-up the enterprise business with parts going into the core network business, zColo business, and Allstream; and then look to separate Allstream from Zayo Group; albeit, not involving a public company split. Also, zColo will operate independently from its remaining Network segment.The reasons behind the change of plans were highlighted by management as 1) an internal analysis that was conducted indicated that it was better to continue operating all of its network services businesses within one structure, 2) feedback from customers that they value Zayo's broad portfolio of core services, 3) feedback from investors who expressed concerns that the planned separation would create disruption and distraction, and 4) the volatile market conditions since Zayo's initial plan announcement.In the past, it was reported that Zayo rejected a buyout offer of $30/share from Blackstone. However, new press reports are emerging that the private equity firms, Digital Colony (backed by Colony Capital Inc. and Digital Bridge Holdings LLC) and EQT, are considering to bid on Zayo. Subsequently, the company canceled its analyst day as it explores its strategic options that could last for months.We think a potential buyout implies an offer price in the mid-30s and a healthy premium to the current trading levels.Private equity firms normally look for an IRR of more than 10% and this type of leverage buyout have high leverage of 5x. However, since ZAYO has already high leverage (4.6x), a smaller step-up in leverage is expected. Hence, under this scenario and at 11x exit multiple, the price range of any potential offers will be between $32-38 per share as it will lead to an IRR of 10-15%.However, investors should be aware of the risks - if a deal does not materialize and the REIT conversion gets delayed or even less likely while competition in the Fiber and zColo segments intensifies, this will weigh on investor sentiment.Zayo's decent quarter and its new reorganization plans present a new belief and focus in its fundamentals. However, reports of a potential buyout offer from private equity firms, especially after the rejection of Blackstone's $30/share offer, started to shed some uncertainty on the company's stock. On the one hand, this offer implies that a potential bid in the range of $32-38, due to its already high leverage (4.6x), could be made which represent significant upside; on the other hand, if no deal goes through, this might also put pressure on the company's long-term prospects as competition intensifies.However, in light of the reorganization plan and the fact that a potential offer might be on the table, we think there's healthy upside for the stock from both multiple expansion and fundamental improvement."
4211054,23944,2018-10-11T07:42:26-04:00,"Zayo provides service across the US, Canada, and in Europe.They are not bogged down by legacy technology nor positioned heavily in declining content businesses.This is about a pure play network company as you can get, and as such, should handsomely benefit from mobile 5G growth.The risks are surging near-term variable interest rates and slower than expected 5G and online content provider growth.","Zayo Group (ZAYO) provides telecommunications and datacenter services in the US, Europe, and Canada.Photo CreditThey are a company I have covered in the past that I think has tons of potential should certain assumptions come true, and also believe are overlooked by most in the market looking for 'the Big Kahuna' type of network organizations. Nevertheless, I feel the upside potential and relative cleanness of their portfolio provides them a special sort of return potential you won't find in the larger telecom organizations. I'll discuss recent trends and provide my thoughts on what could happen in upcoming quarters.The overall results for Zayo could be described as somewhat disappointing, though strong reasons for optimism remain. Here is the segment revenue and EBITDA breakdown, per the most recent earnings presentation.Source: Zayo earnings slides via Seeking AlphaAs we can see, fiber solution, enterprise, and transport remain the biggest segments, accounting for 73% of revenues, sans the Allstream unit, which has been separated. Allstream represents a slowly declining revenue platform in Canada that has strong cash flow, per the company's recent earnings call.It is easy to see why the company separated the reporting for Allstream so as not to influence the perception of the growth-oriented parts of the portfolio; however, investors need to pay attention to the Allstream segment's health until Zayo determines what they want to do with it. Per the earnings presentation, Zayo is ""actively evaluating strategic options, no specific timetable for resolution"" with the Allstream business. A sale could come which may help alleviate some of the current debt burden.Additionally, the company has asked the IRS to opine on changing the company into a REIT status to leverage the returns on the fiber business which dominates the revenues. The process is expected to take from 6-12 months and I believe creates some uncertainty on how investors should value the company's assets and revenues. Due to the accumulation of almost $2 billion in Net Operating Loss (NOL) carry-forwards, which are expected to last through 2023 to 2024, changes in tax structure don't appear to be a short-term financial consideration for the REIT conversion.Source: Zayo earnings slidesThe balance sheet, as seen above, is friendly near term but has upcoming sizable speed bumps in 2023-2025, with a fairly large debt tranche due in 2027. Gross leverage is 4.5x and should concern investors for two reasons: a) this is high compared to bigger peers and may partially inhibit future strategic growth initiatives and b) $1.76 billion of the debt is based upon a steadily rising LIBOR rate as shown below.Source: MacrotrendsLIBOR rates are now approaching Great Recession territory. LIBOR rates encompass two main risk factors, risk and credit. Credit refers to default risk and means the banks expect defaults to likely increase near term, while risk refers to the time value of money. Short-term rates are driven by central bank activity and credit is determined by market sentiment and environment.Given the troubles in emerging markets and rising inflation in the US, it is not likely that LIBOR rates will reverse lower any time soon. Therefore, interest expense for Zayo is not likely to decrease, as a percentage of debt owed, until global market conditions ease. Persistent interest expense risk may also inhibit potential strategic investment projects by reducing the company's expected free cash flows.Revenues are below the expected $8.5 million company guidance and management mentioned that the two culprits were lack of big deal closings for the quarter as well as uncharacteristic slumping of co-location sales. The company expects that co-location will pick up with increases of enterprise sales, which have been a traditional sweet spot. Those deals tend to average 5 years and are a staple of the portfolio. Big deal closings take 1-2 years and the company believes large sales in the pipeline will pay off in future quarters.The churn of 1.2%, which reduces revenues by $6.2 million, implies a 3% growth rate after new net installs are taken into account. The company believes they can partially affect about 20% of that churn number but left guidance at 1.2% for next quarter. Co-location losses affected churn as well as some customer network grooming, resulting from network consolidation efforts, that occurred during the quarter.The company has increased their sales force by 15% and changed leadership at the top. Increased training and the maturing of the sales force lead management to believe revenues will increase. As a result, they are expecting higher numbers from these measures in ensuing quarters, perhaps in the last three months of 2018. The sales organizations have aligned into deep verticals allowing sales consultants to offer end-to-end network and datacenter solutions for each of their customers.In addition, the company filled a gap found between the sales force and regional fiber teams to help address macro changes in 5G demand and Webscale provider needs. As more content goes mobile and online, these changes should drive more consistent sales performance for customers across regions where various Zayo teams previously may have had some internal product delivery blind spots.Company management is in growth mode as they continue to build their inventory of fiber and datacenter space which feeds into their strategic advantage. They do not have a lot of legacy technology to manage such as voice and MPLS, and the potential divestiture of Allstream (partial or whole) could make them even more future growth-oriented than they currently are.As such, the company expects to be levered free cash flow negative by purchasing high quality, modern assets to grow their revenue base while allowing for just enough cash to pay expenses. Recent acquisitions have made Zayo a nationwide fiber and transport provider in the US, while the European and Canadian assets make them attractive to expanding Western companies.The downside is the company has taken on sizable debt in those deals which somewhat limits their capacity to rapidly grow given current revenue levels. The upside is that 5G and Webscale services resulting from growth in online and mobile services could very well propel them to new revenue plateaus and continue to feed capacity for more fiber assets.If 5G technology advancements affect the mobile communications marketplace as many analysts expect, Zayo revenues could explode upward in the fiber and transport segments, which power the company. In other words, Zayo is very well positioned structurally to capitalize on what many are calling the next great expansion for mobile networks.Further, enterprise market growth will push co-location datacenter sales as long as the corporate profits of US and European companies remain strong. But while the company wants to get back to high single-digit datacenter sales growth, this is, in my opinion, a 'nice to have' side revenue that is not crucial to the company's health given their expanded fiber footprints. Colo accounts for slightly less than 10% of revenues.If you are looking for a network company that doesn't have a lot of legacy product drag and is not highly leveraged in declining content businesses, Zayo may be a good choice for you. The company is well positioned to capitalize on US enterprise growth as well as a new generation of mobile wireless traffic.The risks are that rising debt interest expense prevents the company from growing as rapidly to take advantage of certain network growth opportunities. However, management has a clear strategic plan with few unknowns. As long as the economy holds up, this company should be a strong contender for a well-rounded technology portfolio.The stock has fallen about $6 since the last earnings report due to the weaker than expected numbers, and I feel this is very fortuitous for investors. My previous article on Zayo in April noted that $30 was a very good entry point for investors and that the stock was then trading too high on market expectations.The stock could fall through support levels of $30 between now and the next earnings release sometime in November, but I doubt it will go much lower unless the company has another substantial miss. With some 5G rollouts by Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) late in 2018, it is possible the buzz of such announcements will lift the tides of all strong fiber providers including this one.If you are going to purchase an interest in Zayo, now would be a really good time to do it."
4108195,21815,2017-09-20T05:27:00-04:00,"The company had to absorb some 40 acquisitions which might have distracted a bit from keeping some customers happy.But management is onto the problem with a sales and marketing overhaul and increased effort, basically back to basics.Given the operational leverage and inherent profitability of the business model, these initiatives could re-accelerate growth in the medium term.","Zayo Group (ZAYO) is a small player in a competitive market dominated by much bigger companies. However, the industry itself is still growing at a rapid clip as the demand for bandwidth is basically insatiable from stuff like streaming media, cloud applications, online gaming, video surveillance, upcoming 5G and IoT (the internet of things). From Cisco (CSCO):Mobile data is even growing twice as fast, from Fidelity:Here is a useful overview of what they do, from the Q3CC slides:Zayo has gone through a couple of fairly soft quarters, but it argues that there are a lot of opportunities out there, and that basically the only thing they have to do to benefit from these is to boost their sales and marketing leadership and team.There seems to be some scope for improvement as management argued during the Q3CC that 85-90% of bookings come from existing customers, so there seems to be room for expansion into new customers here.So most of their bookings come from existing customers and for this to happen they have to be in an ongoing conversation with these customers.But as it happens, they have also let up here a bit and this is showing in a slight increase in the churn rate:While the company had net new sales of $6.9M (recovering from the dip in the previous quarter where it was just $5.2M), and gross installs of $7.2M, the increase in the churn rate to 1.2% delivered net installs of $1.5M (including one month of ELI).Since most of their orders come from existing customers, even a slight increase in the churn rate (in this case from 1.1% to 1.2%) already has quite an impact. The $1.5M in net installs delivers an organic growth rate of 4%, which is below target (6%-8%).When asked during the CC, management argued:While true, this is a little curious. Zayo is a small company competing against much bigger and better capitalized companies like Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T) in a capital-intensive industry, acquisitions are its bread and butter (having acquired 40 companies or so) and they have done pretty well with these.On the basis of that acquisition-led business model, the company has doubled revenue, tripled EBITDA and moved earnings into positive territory over the last five years.Perhaps even more notable, the company has managed to keep the issue of new shares surprisingly limited:Less surprising is that the company has issued lots of debt, which now totals $5.62B, which is 2/3 of their market cap.Despite the increasing debt, company finances have improved considerably over the years:This is pretty remarkable given the 40 acquisitions and increasing debt. But in the figure, you see that operating expenses are declining as a percentage of revenues, there is good operating leverage. It isn't surprising that EBITDA has also increased as a percentage of revenues.Interest expense has also halved as a percentage of revenues, the increasing debt burden hasn't led to an increasing debt burden, quite the contrary. The result of this is that EPS has moved into the black, even on a GAAP basis.While the stock price has been following these trends, but in a considerably muted fashion. This suggests to us that there is room for improvement.Indeed, the core business model is quite profitable, especially in a low rate environment as the total contract value of bookings is over twice the associated committed capex with an average payback period of just 18 months:So what is lacking? Well, the company argues that with all the noise provided by those 40 acquisitions and the efforts of integrating these, they haven't spent sufficient time with their existing customer, resulting in a creep up in the churn rate.The company plans to execute two remedies:Perhaps the following sums it up, from management during the Q3CC:The company is also focusing more on specific verticals like webscale, wireless, cable TV, PTTs, finance, healthcare, media gaming & adtech, datacenters cloud & software, manufacturing & transportation, federal & public sector.We also think that the big deal activity can come back as it was soft in the quarter for no apparent reason.Despite increasing debt, the company's valuation has steadily declined:Analysts expect 60 cents a share in earnings this year, rising to 70 cents the next, so on an earnings basis, the shares are expensive. Given the operational leverage this isn't overly worrying.Despite a few softer quarters, metrics have been steadily improving at Zayo Group. This isn't surprising as the business model is inherently profitable but the difficulties lie in integrating acquisitions in order to achieve sufficient scale.That might have distracted a bit from caring for existing customers, which are overwhelmingly responsible for revenues. Management is recognizing the problem and is renewing a sales and marketing effort and engaging existing customers.On an earnings basis, the shares are expensive so we see limited upside for the immediate future. However, if management efforts result in renewed acceleration of growth, we think there is room for upside given the substantial operational leverage."
4255662,101850,2019-04-22T08:29:52-04:00,Company management is currently considering several options for the future of the company.Zayo stock price has responded positively to speculation regarding a possible whole business sale to a consortium of private equity firms.Shareholder activism is prompting the company to do something over what is perceived to be a low valuation.The risk remains that the company will not make bold steps and erase any gains that have come on the back of the speculation.,"Zayo Group (NYSE:ZAYO) has been in the news recently with speculation regarding a takeover bid to take the company private, selling off of business units, and possible conversion of some of its assets into a REIT and company management postponing an analyst day while it considers all this. Shareholder activism has been noted, with some disquiet over the company's valuation being felt, and this will rise if management returns from the consideration of its strategic options and do nothing.We think it is likely that management will announce some fairly drastic changes, especially now that activist investors have entered the picture. We think the options on the table will prove accretive to Zayo's share price, even post-buyout announcements and, thus, are bullish at these levels.ZAYO is a provider of bandwidth infrastructure solutions for the communications industry in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. It operates through six segments; Fibre Solutions (~35% of revenue), Transport (~27% of revenue), Enterprise Networks (~13% of revenue), Zayo Colocation (~9% of revenue), Allstream (~15% of revenue), and Other (~1% of revenue). The company has an extensive footprint, diversified product portfolio, and a reputation for effective penetration in different markets, and has a track record of making operating leverage enhancing strategic acquisitions and forging local strategic partnerships.ZAYO has generated a good deal of talking points. It is probably best to start with the company's board and management postponing the planned 14 March 2019 analyst day as they were evaluating strategic alternatives that may enhance shareholder value.What are these alternatives?Well, last year, there was the idea to separate into two publicly-traded entities, with one providing core communications infrastructure, dubbed InfraCo, and the other leveraging infrastructure to provide solutions for a broad set of enterprise customers, dubbed EnterpiseCo. Existing shareholders would be granted shares in both, but this plan has been abandoned.In February, there were reports of a rejection of a bid of approx. US$ 30 per share; indeed, the company noted in a 7 Feb. 2019 conference call they would engage ""with any party that makes a credible proposal that appropriately values the company"" probably referencing this bid and others that are reported to have come in.It was then reported that ZAYO is pursuing the sale of its data center business (zColo), and a company press release indicated the intent for the company to remain focused on building its fiber infrastructure ""whether public or private.""There was also a plan to convert to a real estate investment trust (REIT) by 2020, but this has also been rolled back, according to Reuters.There are issues at ZAYO, and management has been thinking of a variety of ways to resolve them. Although it has been outperforming its sector over the last year, ZAYO has seen earnings pressured from a rising cost of goods sold, which is hurting margins and large infrastructure investments - which the company believes are needed to support its competitive position - are resulting in a debt-induced earnings dilution. The company needs to streamline operations, make disciplined capital allocations, and corporate governance could be improved.This is going to require making changes now that will pay off in the future, but possibly at the cost of hurting the share price. A major investor has written to company management, boldly stating the company is deeply undervalued, and that there are opportunities to remedy this, yet they have not been taken.It would appear that board and management changes could be coming through shareholder activism if they do not act. Hence, we believe that management will have to react soon.Of the alternatives that have hit the headlines, we feel that the sale of the whole business and taking it private is most likely, while the REIT conversion and the zColo sale (and possibly another business unit, Allstream) options seem unlikely.All three would provide a catalyst for the stock price to rise, but as of now, management is considering its options, and we will have to wait and see what their plans will be.While we wait, let us consider those alternatives in more detail.A group of investment firms, including Digital Colony Partners LP, private equity firm EQT AB, and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners have secured exclusive rights to negotiate a deal for the entirety of ZAYO, according to news reports. The reported value range for the deal is about US$ 8-9 billion, which translates into a price of US$ 34-38 per share, above the rejected price of US$ 30. The deal is set to be announced later in April 2019.Management has also indicated that they have been buying back stock at a price of US$ 31 per share, which they feel is a good price. Thus, we think this points toward offers of at least US$ 31 per share and above (vs the current price of $31.71).We think that acquiring ZAYO would be a good fit for this consortium of investors, complementing and adding global scale to assets they already own.ZAYO has announced that it has completed the first phase of its feasibility study to convert into a REIT, and it does indeed have alternatives that would enable conversion. It has applied to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for a private letter ruling (PLR) and expects a response by the end of September 2019. If this is obtained, then we should see a clear path laid out toward conversion.A REIT from a telecom company may sound surprising, but there is a precedent. Windstream Holdings (OTCPK:WINMQ) spun out a REIT from its fiber and copper network assets, which is now known as Uniti Group (UNIT). This strategy would require a change in corporate structure, as any ZAYO REIT could only hold its fiber assets and not the transmission equipment that enables them to carry communications traffic.In addition, this REIT would not enjoy the tax advantages that come with the title - namely, avoiding corporate taxes by paying out a substantial amount of earnings as dividends - until several years after formation due to new regulations introduced by the IRS following the Windstream REIT spin-off.This remains an interesting approach, however, and ZAYO has significant dark fiber - unused fiber available for rental to companies looking to expand their network - which is ideal for REIT inclusion. It would be expected that current shareholders would receive shares in any REIT spin-off, and they would eventually receive large dividends on those shares, from revenues gained from renting/leasing assets back to ZAYO or other companies.zColo by ZAYO offers colocation data center (equipment, space, and bandwidth are available for rental to customers) facilities in over 30 markets worldwide. ZAYO has revealed a pro forma annualized EBITDA of approx. US$ 130 million for this business unit as part of its discussions concerning a potential sale or spin-off. The data center sector has seen consolidation, and we think there would be more than a few willing buyers looking to add to their capacity.Following Zayo's purchase of Allstream, Inc. purchased in 2016 for CAD$ 465 million, the fiber and data center assets and the customers have been incorporated into ZAYO Canada - a core business. What remained - voice, unified communications, and small enterprise businesses - were retained in another business unit and retained under the Allstream brand. This unit generates some US$ 8-10 million in cash per quarter.For both of these unit sales, we think shedding them at a premium would be value accretive for shareholders, who could benefit from the return of capital, and strategic buyers should be courted for this. In addition, a sale of either would help to streamline operations and sharpen the focus on the core businesses that remain.Following the series of announcements, ZAYO stock has responded positively to the prospect of strategic action. Given the concerns raised by major shareholders regarding the company's performance, we think it is likely that management will announce some fairly drastic changes.They have considerable options, as we have discussed above, all of which should be positive for the share price. Of the three, a sale to the private equity consortium being announced for US$ 38 per share would provide the most dramatic revaluation in the share price. If nothing happens, we do expect the share price to de-rate slightly in the near term, but that seems unlikely, given the discontent being voiced by significant shareholders. Overall, we think Zayo offers compelling strategic optionality at these levels and remain bullish."
4032888,76785,2016-12-28T13:05:06-05:00,"Zayo Group is a roll-up play in bandwidth infrastructure, from nothing to $7B in assets in under ten years.Management has proven to be excellent at finding undervalued assets to snap up - and also proven integrators.The business is capex heavy, and GAAP results are weighed down by depreciation; nonetheless, the company finally posted positive earnings per share.As the company (hopefully) continues to post GAAP profits, investor demand is likely to rise.I'm cautiously optimistic on Zayo shares, despite my fears surrounding the industry it operates in.","I have no doubt that bandwidth infrastructure is one of the most critically important assets currently being built within the United States. Unfortunately, I also know that bandwidth infrastructure has historically been a terrible place to invest your money. Companies rushed into building out the structure in the early 2000s, and the rush into the technology was an exhibition of classic irrational exuberance.Overcapacity quickly became a problem, as well as overbuilding on similar routes, which lead to aggressive pricing competition between firms. Given that many of today's bandwidth-intensive processes (big data analytics, cloud computing, consumer demand via streaming video) simply did not exist or were in their infancy at the time, many of these firms eventually went bankrupt.Are operators smart enough to learn their lesson? If you think so, Zayo Group (NYSE:ZAYO) seems like an excellent choice. The demand problem has certainly abated; consumer and business demand for bandwidth is expected to grow 53% annually from 2015 to 2020 (after exponential growth over the prior five years) and traditional wired traffic is expected to grow 22% annually. Nonetheless, Zayo faces a problem in trying to compete for its share of the pie in this market: its size.The company is competing with massive incumbent local exchange carriers (""ILECs"") like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), infrastructure providers like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and regional competitors operating under similar business models. Most of these companies have substantially higher access to capital, as well as more brand clout with customers. Wonton expansion in this space has never been rewarded, and that won't change in this next flurry of activity; see Google Fiber's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) struggles and hard-learned lessons.By extension then, Zayo must be an exceptionally nimble operator in order to be viable. Management must have the foresight to develop (or acquire) assets in the right locales, picking up the crumbs that larger players leave behind. The company has decided to focus on a few key areas, which are based upon its operating segments:This is, by all accounts, a roll-up strategy. Investors need to remember that Zayo was founded less than ten years ago in 2007, but the company has made 39 acquisitions since then for net consideration of $6.4B (including the $1.4B for Electric Lightwave, which the company just announced, but not yet reported in a quarterly filing).I will give management credit for doing what appears to be an excellent job of acquiring and tucking-in these operations into the operational fold. Reported integration and transaction costs have been minimal ($21M in fiscal 2016), particularly when compared to acquisition sizing ($1,300M worth of assets), and Zayo makes little effort to exclude those costs as part of any non-GAAP measures.Electric Lightwave AcquisitionThe announcement by Zayo late last month that it would be acquiring Electric Lightwave was not surprising, as deal-making is in this company's DNA. However, it will be the second-largest deal in the company's history at $1,420M in total cash consideration. This will be another big boost to consolidated revenues, with Electric Lightwave likely to provide a 25% driver to the top line in fiscal 2017 by itself.Importantly, these assets are extremely complementary to what Zayo currently holds. Up to this point, Zayo has primarily been competing on the Eastern seaboard, with only some marginal assets in California, and elsewhere along the Western United States. Electric Lightwave has spent years developing core long-haul fiber assets to connect most markets west of the Rocky Mountains, particularly in key routes like Las Vegas to Phoenix, along with assets in metros like Portland and San Diego.The company was actually in the midst of separating into two separately-managed business (Electric Lightwave and Integra) in order to divide its fiber assets and its competitive local exchange carrier (""CLEC"") business. Zayo stepped in as a buyer before that separation was completed.Like most deals, the purchase looks very solid against Zayo's current valuations: transaction was done at 7.9x adjusted EBITDA, 6.5x with synergy expectations. Zayo by comparison has traded >15x TTM EV/EBITDA for the entirety of its existence as a publicly-traded company. While not explicitly stated, this deal should be accretive to earnings per share once synergies are accounted for.Zayo's Inflection PointWhile the company has managed to be positive on a free cash flow basis in the past (and did so again in Q1), Q1 of 2017 was the first quarter of GAAP profitability for Zayo in its operational history. The slow and steady growth in its legacy business (new service installations/annual price increases outpacing churn) has finally yielded operating leverage, leading the company to the promised land of operating in the black. Analysts expect this trend to continue, with the company expected to report marginal positive earnings per share in 2017 ($0.35/share is the current consensus for full year fiscal 2017).Investors would glean more from looking at cash flows. Zayo Group provides some interesting granularity on this issue, which shows that the long-term value of the contracts that are booked greatly outweigh the upfront cost and maintenance capital expenditures to maintain them:*Zayo Group, Fiscal Q1 2017 Earnings ReleaseOn average, Zayo Group believes the value of its contracts are greater than 2x the associated costs, with an average payback period of 26 months. Not bad. The flip side being that the vast majority of the company's assets have not reached that maturity age yet. It remains to be seen if yields are as favorable as management believes, or that churn rates remain low.As a further boost for Zayo Group, it is unlikely that the company will pay any meaningful cash taxes for the next five years at minimum. At the end of the company's most recently ended fiscal year, Zayo has $1,213M of federal net operating losses (""NOLs"") and $401M of NOLs in foreign jurisdictions. Further adding to the total, Zayo recently acquired more than $400M in NOLs as part of its Electric Nightwave acquisition. These NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2019, and will be gone fully by 2035. Investors are banking on these assets to help boost profitability in the medium term.Above, you can see that on a GAAP EBITDA and EBITDA margin basis, Zayo Group has had a few stumbles along the way as it worked out deal integrations and built its business outside of Dark Fiber. Fiscal 2015 in particular was volatile, and contributed to volatility that was present in the equity price at the time. Beyond those issues, I would also keep in mind that my metrics are also impacted by reported GAAP income tax provisions, which is obviously not reflective of the actual cash tax rate given the NOLs the company holds.Nonetheless, there is a clear acceleration in EBITDA over the past six quarters, and leverage (net debt/EBITDA, interest coverage) is down significantly since fiscal 2014, in spite of the recent deal acquisition activity. The overall outlook is getting far more positive, particularly given the ""earnings crossover"" into profitability.As a result, this change in sentiment is also reflected in the company's debt offerings. The company's unsecured 2025 bonds (CUSIP 989194AL9), which were issued at a 6.375% coupon more than a year ago, currently trade well above par, and have rallied significantly this year after collapsing post issuance. Sentiment is starting to shift, even among more risk-sensitive fixed income investors that are going to be particularly cautious on long-term outlook within this industry.TakeawayGiven the heavy insider ownership (47%) and significant continued hedge fund ownership (roughly another 25%), volatility is to be expected given the lack of float that is out there to be traded. I'm cautiously optimistic, despite my trepidation to dip my toe in this industry. Listening to conference calls, current leadership does seem to have an excellent grasp on creating value in this space. Make no mistake that Zayo's fiscal 2017 will be incredibly important to the company, as the shift from speculative stock with no profitability to growth company with a proven model hopefully becomes a reality.For deep dive research on asymmetric risk/reward plays in the Industrial and Basic Materials sectors (particularly small and mid-caps), consider investing alongside me and other subscribers within Industrial Insights.

4160921,23944,2018-04-04T06:08:27-04:00,Consumer trends show wireless data use continuing to grow.Zayo's new deal to provide backhaul support for a major wireless carrier across 21 states is a big win for the company in their biggest segment.Zayo gets the benefits of wireless network expansion without direct exposure to consumer wireless competition risks.,"Photo CreditZayo (ZAYO) recently announced another big backhaul win in which it will provide hundreds of route miles of additional fiber across 21 states with a major wireless carrier (carrier not specified). While Zayo will be expanding their fiber, the deal also uses existing fiber investments made by Zayo in previous years. This shows that wireless carriers, thirsty for more bandwidth on their wireless networks, are now preparing to monetize Zayo's previous network expansions.Source: CTIA.orgZayo is booking sales on expected 5G expansion before the wireless service providers are, and expansion will continue for a number of years. There is plenty of road left for Zayo to continue selling their network to wireless companies for the foreseeable future.Source: CTIA.orgI have stated in past articles that I do not expect wireless service companies to make out like bandits, from a profit margin perspective, on 5G due to the vastly increased bandwidth requirements of the standard as well as the increased expected adoption rates by consumers in crowded metro areas. Add to that the price wars going on in wireless plans right now which I have previously documented, and wireless carriers are facing potentially increased costs and reduced revenues. At some point the two will meet in equilibrium, but nobody knows where that is yet. This dynamic should hold in the short term, providing a good entry point for investors in the right telecom company. However, 5G will eventually drive explosive network growth which will reprice fiber in the market and drive up asset values for those that own a lot of it, over time. Zayo is positioned to capitalize on the growth in demand for new fiber. And while the potential exists for downward pressure on lease rates for fiber in the short term, the fact is that I expect all of Zayo's to be utilized in the coming expansion.Revenues should increase; however, we will have to wait and see how margins are affected across the industry. It is possible, if 5G adoption is very robust, that fiber rates rise quickly to address demand dynamics until providers can catch up. At some point, the large wireless carriers will probably have overbuilt capacity and rates will then fall again, which has happened before. This cycle will probably take about 4-5 years to complete. So how will the company's investments into 5G affect their portfolio? Fiber makes up 31% of the company revenue, as shown by the company in a recent presentation.Source: Seeking AlphaThe company will likely realize a marked increase in their fiber network related revenues for the foreseeable future. Given that Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T) are building out 5G starting in 2018, and the other wireless carriers have also announced intentions to participate in 5G expansion, Zayo is very well positioned to take advantage of what is likely to be staggering growth in high bandwidth wireless services.Zayo re-aligned their vertical sales teams in January and the carrier vertical accounts for 48% of their marketing. The company is betting heavily on this space as a major growth factor moving forward, and I agree with them.Source: Seeking AlphaCompany segment data indicates that the transport and enterprise segments have higher churn (1.6 - 1.9%) and very low implied growth rate. Translated, this means that companies are not booking sales for long haul, cloud, or WAN ethernet services with Zayo. This is consistent with the broader telecom sector trends as competition, leading to commoditization of these services, signals low future growth and increasing margin pressures.Zayo's Enterprise Value / EBITDA is 12.33. This is too high (over 10) to be considered a value play at the $35 price level. Profit margin is only 3.42%, and being a telecom stock, Zayo has lots of debt ($5.6 billion) and CAPEX expenditures (~$200 million per quarter) to maintain the network. Operating cash flow is $963 million while levered free cash flow is $153.18 million. Much of the cash goes to interest payments on the debt.Zayo needs the 5G expansion to go well to increase their FCF and provide a reason for investors to spend their money on the stock. Market analysts mostly expect this to happen, with 6 strong buys, 5 buys, 5 holds, and 1 underperform out of 17 analysts. Apparently, some are being duly cautious; however, due to the young age of the company and the big spend on increased network usage before we actually know what the 5G revenue data will look like. Those cautious analysts are the smarter ones for the time being. Source: Yahoo FinanceOn the two year chart, $30 seems to be both a resistance and support line for the stock. Because I think the stock is somewhat overvalued, I would look to enter somewhere around the $30 mark. It is quite likely the stock does not fall to this point in the next 30-60 days due to the 5G euphoria.Source: Yahoo FinanceThe stock recently broke through the 200 day moving average, which is a bullish sign. If the price retries the 50 day moving average, then I would step away and wait for a better entry point. If the price moves down and tests the 200 day average, then it is more likely it will continue to fall through the average to longer term support at $30. The reality is that the costs of expansion will show up on the statement of cash flows and balance sheet before the bulk of the 5G revenue does, so impatient investors are likely to increase selling during 2018 while moving on to other targets. That is when the smart investor will strike.Institutions and insiders hold most of the stock, so float is not high except for the mutual funds which cater to retail investors. About 1% of the stock is traded daily. Therefore, the stock may be somewhat less liquid than desired if you decide to get into it. January 2019 call options are about $4-5 over the current stock price, at time of this article, which indicates a fairly bullish sentiment in the market for the company. Conversely, the short ratio is 7.25% which indicates some sentiment, however, that the stock may be too high. I expect the short ratio to increase this year for the reasons mentioned. The company is a good target for capitalizing on the next telecom network expansion phase mostly for the fact they aren't bogged down in too many legacy services, as many larger telecom companies are currently. Be patient and wait for your spot, however, to maximize your potential gains."
4027424,101421,2016-11-30T18:50:32-05:00,"Zayo said it will acquire Western U.S. fiber network company Electric Lightwave.The transaction amount is $1.42 billion, and appears to be a reasonable price.Electric will provide all-important metro connectivity and on-net buildings to add to Zayo's footprint.Assuming timely integration throughout 2017, the acquisition will be a significant positive for Zayo.","Quick TakeCommunications infrastructure company Zayo Group Holdings (NYSE:ZAYO) said it will acquire Electric Lightwave in an all-cash transaction for $1.42 billion. Electric Lightwave was created in a largely geographic operational split from Integra Telecom Holdings, which left Integra's remaining operations in the upper Midwest states of Colorado, Minnesota and North Dakota.Zayo gains a stronger metro network of more than 3,100 on-net commercial buildings, metro fiber, and 100 data centers, along with a traditional SME and voice-based business generating predictable revenues. Assuming closing of the deal in 1Q2017 and its prompt integration over the following quarters, the buy should be a significant positive for Zayo over the medium term.Target CompanyVancouver, Washington-based Electric Lightwave was founded in 1996 by Dudley Slater and is headed by CEO Marc Willency. The company has built a facilities-based fiber network of 8,100 miles of long-haul fiber and 4,000 miles of metro fiber for 23 fiber markets in the Western U.S., including Spokane, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Sacramento, San Jose, Salt Lake City and Boise.Additionally, Electric has more than 3,100 office buildings and 100 data centers with on-net connectivity. Electric's all-fiber network map is shown below on the left; Zayo's on the right:(Sources: Integra, Zayo)Electric Lightwave's revenue is split 40/60 between infrastructure-focused telecom businesses and SME/voice businesses.Acquisition RationaleIn August 2016, Electric Lightwave was split off from Integra Telecom Holdings into Electric's pure-play, fiber-based network services company, likely to increase the division's attractiveness to potential acquirers needing a Western U.S. footprint.Zayo CEO Dan Caruso said about the acquisition in a company statement:So, Zayo appears to be acquiring Electric first for its West Coast metro fiber assets and secondly for its long-haul fiber, which is probably redundant to Zayo's intercity fiber, though it's always nice to have more long-haul capacity.Terms And CommentaryZayo paid $1.42 billion in cash for Electric's business that in the six months ended June 30, 2016, generated annualized pro-forma revenues of $429 million and EBITDA of $134 million. (Unaudited) The acquisition price will be funded through a combination of cash on hand and debt.So, Zayo paid approximately 3.3x revenues and 10.6x 1H2016 annualized EBITDA for the deal. Cogent Communications (NASDAQ:CCOI) is another facilities-based all-fiber network that is trading at a Price/Sales multiple of 3.92x and an EV/EBITDA of 16.38x.Comparing the two companies indicates that Zayo did not overpay for Electric. Furthermore, Zayo intends to cut more than $40 million in costs and reap more than $400 million in NOL (Net Operating Loss) carryforwards, further sweetening the financial side of the deal. The combination appears to have been well thought-out from both strategic and financial perspectives.Long-haul fiber networks are comparatively easier to build than metro networks. Electric's metro networks and 3,100 on-net buildings are the main assets that I see accruing to Zayo. Acquiring this greater metro presence in the all-important Western U.S. market is a real coup for Zayo, and not overpaying for it indicates management knows how to negotiate a deal.Now, we wait for news on the integration of the acquisition, which will likely require 12 to 18 months at a minimum. To that end, Zayo said that Electric's infrastructure-focused business segments 'will be rapidly integrated into the core Zayo organization, processes and systems,' so that will be priority number one.Second priority will be the monetization of the more traditional telecom side for its SME and voice revenues. I'm positive on the outlook for the deal and await further news on its closing and timely integration.I write about IPOs, follow-ons, and M&A deals.

According to Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), mobile data traffic is expected to grow at a compound rate of 57% from 2014 to 2019. Additionally, Gartner estimates there will be roughly 25 billion Internet connected devices by 2020, providing an attractive market opportunity for Zayo Group. We feel their business does enjoy substantial competitive advantages by virtue of their route and fiber miles and high network density.Additionally, the company has high visibility of their revenue given their weighted average contract term of 71 months. Zayo Group also brings an experienced management with a history of acquiring and integrating bandwidth infrastructure and managing fiber networks. The valuation of Zayo Group at first appears to be absurd, but it becomes more reasonable when examining the higher growth rate of the firm versus its peers.In order to value Zayo Group, we looked for comparable companies providing fiber and data center services. We also restricted our search to companies with market capitalizations less than 20 billion, excluding Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and other major fiber and data providers. Additionally, we excluded Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) from the comparable companies given its different legal organization as a tax advantaged REIT. From the multiples below, Zayo Group trades at a substantial premium to its peer group.However, Zayo Group is growing at a much higher growth rate relative to its peers (see below). The company is projected to greatly outpace the revenue growth of Level 3 Communications (NYSE:LVLT) over the next five years, growing top line at almost double the pace. Additionally, Zayo Group has significantly higher gross profit and EBITDA margins compared to its peers, which investors are willing to pay for. Zayo Group's current valuation thus seems fair, given it provides investors a way to purchase higher growth in the broadband sector where it earns higher margins on that growth.  Source: Capital IQ/Company FilingsIn terms of Zayo Group's competitive advantage, its scale is constantly discussed. Scale is extremely important as it would be extremely difficult to replicate the company's metro, regional, and long haul fiber assets given the significant time, capital and expertise needed. For instance, from 2012 to 2014, excluding acquisitions, the company spent roughly $693 million for expansion and maintenance capital expenditures. Additionally, the majority of the markets Zayo Group serves have few other networks capable of providing similar high bandwidth and connection options. Source: Zayo Group ProspectusZayo Group has a long history of acquisitions and has spent a considerable amount of its investing cash flows to acquire strategic fiber assets. Recently, Zayo Group acquired Allstream for CAD $465 million at less than five times EBITDA, acquiring 9,000 route kilometers of metro fiber within Canada's top five metropolitan markets. This seems like a good acquisition for Zayo Group given roughly half of Allstream's revenue stream directly fits with Zayo Group's core business segments. We see acquisitions as a good use of capital at this stage, but expect as the company feels they have established a sufficient network they will start pursuing greater share repurchases and dividends given shareholder friendly management.Zayo Group is operating within an enormous and high growth market, with a strong history of acquisitions, and a reasonable valuation. Given the stock trades at seven times revenue and fourteen times EBITDA currently, we would advise investors to keep this stock on their radar but wait for a more cheap entry point if they want to own this growth story."

The network footprint extends span over 81,000 route miles and 6,000,000 fiber miles, serves 319 geographic markets in the United States and Europe, and connects to over 15,700 buildings, including 4,200 cellular towers and 756 datacenters. Zayo was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, with European headquarters in London and Paris. Zayo provides the bandwidth infrastructure services for a fixed monthly recurring fee under contracts that vary between one and twenty years in length. As of June 30, 2014, approximately 97% of the revenue of the company was recurring in nature with a weighted average remaining contract term of approximately 43 months.Zayo's business strategies1.

From IBIS, Zayo is the leader of dark fiber sector, owning 26.7% of market share. The second one is Quanta Services (11%) and the third one is Level 3 Communications (9.7%).Dark fiber is simply optical fiber that is not yet connected to telecommunications transmission equipment; if the fiber were connected, it would be considered ""lit."" Industry operators primarily lease or sell previously installed fiber to a range of markets, including telecommunications and internet-based companies, allowing these firms to manage their own networks.Source: IBIS, Dark Fiber Market ReportDuring the tech boom in the late 1990s, a significant amount of telecommunications companies started to build new fiber in anticipation of future sharp increases in data demand. However, when the tech bubble burst and technological advancements reduced the need for cable, demand ultimately fell short of supply. Yet, falling lease prices and increasing bandwidth needs since 2005 have caused the industry's performance to pick up in recent years. Over the five years to 2013, industry revenue is increased at an annualized rate of 7.2%, to reach $1.0 billion. Over the five years to 2018, industry revenue is anticipated to increase at an annualized rate of 4.4% to $1.3 bn. The number of industry enterprises is forecast to decline at an annualized rate of 1.0% to 156 companies in 2018.Forecast of Dark Faber Market GrowthSource: IBIS, Dark Fiber Market ReportInvestment Thesis:Achieved 27% of market share in Dark Fiber, plus 70% of EBITDA MarginThe uniqueness, density and depth of Zayo's long haul, metro and regional fiber networks have positioned Zayo as the rock-solid leader of fiber network. Competition in dark fiber services tends to be less intense; the entry barrier is extremely high. Fiber optic cables are costly to install, primarily explaining why smaller telecommunications and internet-based companies shy away from making these purchases. Instead, these companies choose to lease or purchase previously installed and unused fiber optic cables from industry operators. Given this dynamic and the generally longer contractual term of dark fiber services, dark fiber pricing tends to be more inflationary in nature. Therefore, Zayo's dark fiber business has achieved EBITDA Margin of 70%.Good pricing power diverse customer baseThe largest single customer, based on recurring revenue, accounted for only 7% of Zayo's revenue, and total revenues from the top ten customers accounted for approximately 30% of the total revenue.Source: Company PresentationFocused on equity value creation through strong managementZayo believes in fostering an entrepreneurial culture that aligns the interests of their employees, management, and stockholders.

The table below still shows the original EBITDA numbers. The range of EV/EBITDA is in the range of 8x to 14x. I give Zayo a higher EV/adj.

Its competitors, Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT) and Quanta Services (NYSE:PWR), have market-cap/Levered FCF multiple of 32x to 48x.

Indeed tightening credit markets may continue to raise questions about the valuation, both in isolation as well as compared to peers like Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT) and Cogent (NASDAQ:CCOI).The volatility may increase in the current environment, but a closer understanding of the fundamentals should offer opportunities to monetize the volatility as execution separates the wheat from the chaff in the space. Fundamentally, acquisitions have allowed the company to collect valuable fiber optic network and data center assets. The demand for bandwidth infrastructure and network-neutral interconnection services is strong and rarely doubted upon. The momentum for the company seems strong with customer churn controlled, decent organic growth, forward indicators like a good pipeline and a stable base of contracted recurring revenues.Trading at 10-12 times EV/expected adjusted EBITDA and growing adjusted EBITDA at 15-20%, the stock has an opportunity to benefit from earnings growth and not just multiple expansions, especially if the availability of assets improves. One of the major market concerns over the past few years has been that of rising asset prices, making acquisitions difficult; it may ease with the wobbly equity markets while the cost to put new fiber or replacement cost is barely changing and the demand for bandwidth is growing strongly. So weak equity markets and tighter credit markets may allow even better opportunities for the operator with superior execution and cash flows to acquire.Collection of quality assets that are improvingAfter more than 34 acquisitions, the company now has more than 85,000 route miles of network, 45 data centers and 6,600 customers, split between 54% enterprise and 46% carriers and wireless customers. The network is mostly concentrated in the U.S., U.K. and France. On the metro side, the company owns down to the right away, for the majority of the network, which makes it unique, deep and dense. Besides the metro areas, the footprint extends to the regions around them. The company also owns most of the intercity fiber at the cable level. 98% of the revenue is recurring.Competitively, more than the intra industry competition, investors, especially after the Crown Castle's (NYSE:CCI) Sunesys acquisition, are concerned about tower companies bidding up the prices and making most consolidation stories, including Zayo, difficult, but the fears seem misplaced, considering the extensive network, operating expertise and the thick fiber required in the mobile infrastructure segment.Source: Zayo. Telecom services comprise of LVLT and CCOIIn terms of profitability, the company is clearly outpacing not just the peers, but most of the ""utility like"" businesses in the tech space as well. Overall, what should help is the execution, including that of driving synergies from the acquired assets, besides achieving scale.Growth catalystsTotal revenue growth, 25% in the last quarter, has been good, but even the organic growth, 8% in the latest quarter, has been relatively decent. Going forward, the growth should be broad based rather than overly dependent upon any single customer or market.From a segment standpoint, revenues are split evenly between physical infrastructure products, which are made up of dark fiber, mobile infrastructure and interconnect focused colocation, and cloud and connectivity, which consist of bandwidth infrastructure solutions with customers paying for access. Growth of dark fiber and mobile infra is significant since dark fiber is among the highest EBITDA margin businesses and mobile infrastructure is in a high growth phase.Organic: With $6 billion in revenue under contract having an average remaining contract term of approximately 46 months, strong net installation and a growing pipeline, the momentum seems good.Zayo Installations. Source: Quarterly resultsInstallations, gross and net, are strong, helped by a steadily improving churn rate. Net installs, one of the best indicators of near-term growth, should be able to grow maintaining current sales and churn levels. Bookings are growing at a steady rate, enough to maintain a high-single-digit rate. Bookings for the last two quarters have been significantly higher than the installs. Service activation pipeline at 12% of revenue run-rate is also at a record level.Going forward, ramp of expansion projects like the Greater Seattle and Greater Nashville metro builds as well as long-haul routes from Atlanta to DC and Phoenix to Dallas should help the organic growth rate. Overall, the focus going forward may turn more towards growing the organic side of the business.Inorganic: Now that the integration of Latisys, recently acquired colocation and Internet infrastructure company, is mostly complete, the company should benefit from an increased data center portfolio (45 facilities), opening up of new markets like Denver, Orange County and London, strengthened ability to offer transport and data center services to the enterprise customers within these markets and sales synergies from leveraging the combined teams. Latisys should strengthen the colocation and cloud sales while Zayo can contribute to the bandwidth infrastructure sales capabilities, as the combined sales teams ramp up.Although no inorganic activity took place during the last quarter itself, but with improved finances, combined with consolidation opportunities, especially fiber and data center opportunities across North America and Europe, the company may be back.Debt high, but not too concerningLike any other consolidation play, debt level is a good barometer to measure inorganic growth and value-creation opportunities from deleveraging.There is limited to worry about present debt levels, especially with $700-800 million of adjusted EBITDA that is growing at 15-20%. Credit ratings could benefit if adjusted leverage approaches 4x and FCF/Debt is sustained above 10%.Creating value aggressivelyZayo's equity valueAs the chart above shows, return on equity has been more than 6x over since 2007 when the company started. Going forward, high capital intensity is discomforting during tightening credit markets, but there are a few things worth keeping in mind while working out the numbers:Working out the above should lead to $100-200 million of free cash flow, comfortably.FloorThe recent amendment and extension of the stockholder agreement with the largest investor should ease the lock-up expiration concerns, but more than that high replacement cost of the assets should provide a decent floor to the stock, especially if the operating metrics stay healthy.Third-party researchers have done some great analysis in the field and considering the average cost per route mile to deploy fiber at approximately $100k/route mile and equally expensive to build strategically located data centers, the interest in Zayo's assets should be high in the event of any major dislocation in the market.Note: Detailed proprietary model is not attached in this note for the sake of easy readability, but happy to help and provide more details to readers interested in understanding the calculations used in this note."
3962755,52712,2016-04-03T07:34:11-04:00,"Zayo Group is in great position with its long-term dark fiber contracts which have high margin profiles.We like the company' strategy of acquiring businesses to increase its operating leverage and broaden its customer base.Recent Allstream acquisition adds 18,000 route miles to fiber optic network and 3,300 on net buildings in Canada's major markets.Valuation is attractive in our view trading at roughly 9.5 times next twelve months enterprise value to EBITDA.","Zayo Group (NYSE:ZAYO) is a large and fast growing provider of bandwidth infrastructure within the United States. Recently the stock fell substantially when the company missed revenue and EBITDA projections. We believe this sell-off was overdone given the company can reasonably expect to achieve over $3 million net installs in the near term leading to 10% revenue growth, which is indicative of a strong demand environment. Overall we are bullish on the shares given the strong ability of the company to continue achieving returns through successful acquisitions, the high demand environment for Zayo's services, the long-term predictability in Zayo Group's dark fiber business, and an attractive valuation given the recent decline in the shares.Zayo group has shown an ability to execute on acquistions, with relatively easy access to the credit markets and the ability to have additional capital when needed for acquisitions. Recently Zayo Group acquired Viatel for $101 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition provides Zayo group with 8,400 kilometer of fiber networks in over 8 countries. Zayo Group also recently acquired Allstream for roughly $465 million, making Zayo Group the only Pan U.S./Canada communications infrastructure provider. This acquisition was also reasonably priced in our view at a pre-synergized EBITDA of less than five times. Additionally roughly half of Allstream's revenue is a direct fit with Zayo's existing business segments, providing Zayo with a strong regional brand with which to expend its top line. We feel these acquisitions are attractive uses of Zayo Group's capital and will add to the companies ability to generate free cash flow going forward. We also note that the company's large list of acquisitions act as a competitive barrier as they scale, limiting the ability of other companies to challenge their scale. Management continues to reiterate this outlook, writing in their SEC filings that one of the company's significant competitive advantages is their ability to intelligently expand through acquisitions.Source: Zayo Group Investor RelationsSource: Zayo Group ProspectusSource: Imgmob Dark Fiber Illustration ImageDark fiber is a great business segment in our view. Dark fiber is fiber that has not yet been connected to telecommunications transmission equipment or optronics and is therefore not active or ""lit"" by the fiber cable owner. As private enterprises(media, financial institutions) and public sectors(schools, hospitals) continue to evolve to adopt more data, they will look to procure more scale, security, and control over their network operations. Numerous large internet conglomerates have expressed interest in expanding into the data infrastructure business given the enormous profits that Verizon and AT&T enjoy as a result of controlling the fiber networks. Google is in the midst of rolling out Google Fiber, possibly even expanding to major cities such as New York soon. Zayo group markets and sells dark fiber under long term contracts typically between five and twenty years in length. The length of these contracts provides great visibility into Zayo Group's topline, with Dark fiber accounting for over 37% of the company's revenue in the most recent quarter.Given the recent lock-up expiration, we like that management has expressed its intent to use their share buyback capacity when needed. Share buybacks should function to place a relative bottom on short-term share price declines and help investors better withstand the volatility of this company's common equity. The share buybacks would also signal to investors that the company views shares as undervalued and possibly increase the companies return on equity by virtue of having less shares outstanding.Overall Zayo Group offers investors the ability to invest in the increasing trend of data usage where people are demanding more and more bandwidth (see below). We are bullish on Zayo group given that (1) it has other attractive acquisition opportunities in the pipeline, (2) dark fiber is a segment with sticky revenue and great industry growth, and (3) the unique and expansive nature of the company's infrastructure assets. We feel given the volatility in the shares and no immediate value correcting catalyst the best way to open a position in Zayo Group is through using limit orders over a multi-month horizon. We believe shares could trade up to the mean analyst price target of $31 over the next 18 months as investors better appreciate the opportunities we outlined here."
4002807,52382,2016-08-29T12:29:54-04:00,"Zayo is executing nicely, even though the stock has not moved much from year-ago levels.New wins, acquisitions, organic expansion and growing acceptance of shared dark fiber assets may act as significant positive catalysts.The sentiment should get a boost from any deal with Google Fiber, Lightower or both.","Zayo Group's (NYSE:ZAYO) stock is trading close to the levels seen late last year, close to the timing of my previous note, even though volatility during that time frame was high. The market has continued to doubt the name, whether due to competitive concerns, with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) buying XO Communications and Google Fiber (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) roll-outs, or the company's ability to carry on with its acquisition strategy in light of volatile credit and equity markets. But the execution seems to be defying odds and strong fundamentals warrant another look.Source: Zayo GroupThe macro thesis for the assets continues to be strong, with demand for bandwidth from carriers as well as enterprise customers growing strongly and the cost to put new fiber/replacement cost increasing, consistent and recurring revenue growth and consistently ramping net installs to its customer base. Competitively, a consolidating market is helping the existing players with scale. Financially, the improving balance sheet and strong cash flow seem to be impressing the rating agencies, as reflected in the recent upgrade by Moody's, and further improvement should allow the company to explore further acquisitions, especially now that Lightower Fiber is rumored to be up for sale.The core thesis continues to be strongThe demand for bandwidth infrastructure and network-neutral interconnection services is enjoying secular growth and the company is very well positioned in the dark fiber or lit services for wireless backhaul or small cells. With Verizon and Sprint (NYSE:S) advocating dark fiber solutions for new small cell deployments, the business should continue to enjoy favorable tailwinds.Having more than 112,000 route miles of network, 61 data centers and 6,800 customers, split almost evenly between enterprise and carriers & wireless customers, the quality as well as scale of assets position the company to lead the consolidation wave in the industry underway, especially if any type of major combination, like Lightower discussed below, is worked out.Good execution and opportunities offered by the changing market should start bearing resultsThe current momentum highlights relatively decent execution, i.e. high-single-digit revenue growth, low-single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, low churns, consistently growing net installations, growing service activation pipeline and average payback of close to 16 months.Besides the existing momentum, organic expansions, strong new project signups and acquisitions suggest a well diversified (both end-markets as well as the type of services) growth going forward (e.g. the recently won Denver and Dallas school deals, a data center acquisition in Dallas and integrating the recent Allstream acquisition in Canada).A few weeks ago, Zayo talked about a ""leading technology company"" requesting dark fiber network in San Francisco, which is rumored to be Google Fiber, which makes sense given Google Fiber's planned build out in the Valley area are on hold, while there is growing acceptance of sharing dark fiber networks by the service providers and the company has rented dark fiber assets from Huntsville Utilities.Any type of deal with Lightower can be another major positive catalyst for the stock, whether it is an outright purchase or a merger. Lightower will be a great addition, with almost 30,000 route miles of network and more than 250 data centers. Given the company's $400 million of EBITDA, the expected price, based on some of the recent deals completed in the space, may be around $6-7 billion. The size of the deal will be large for Zayo and may scare some investors, but the quality and size of assets will be worth it."
2735275,66533,2014-12-06T17:21:56-05:00,Zayo Group is a solid play on Internet bandwidth demand.The stock has risen more than 21% since its debut.We believe it could reach $40 in the next year.,"Zayo Group (NYSE:ZAYO) is a leading provider of raw bandwidth infrastructure and bandwidth infrastructure solutions. The company's IPO was priced at $19, and the stock closed at $22 on its first day of trading in October. As of Friday's close, ZAYO trades for $26.78. We believe the stock is undervalued and could rise substantially in the next year. In this article we'll delve deeper into the company's growth drivers.High-Margin Business Growing FasterZayo generates high-margin revenue by providing raw bandwidth infrastructure by leasing its fiber-optic networks metropolitan areas as well as between cities. This is its primary growth driver. It leases fiber-optic cables to large customers, such as wireless telecom companies and financial services companies. In addition to leasing its fiber-optic cables, it operates 27 datacenters. Providing raw bandwidth infrastructure is a high-margin business with recurring and non-recurring revenue from long-term contracts that last from three to 20 years.With the advent of big data, cloud computing and Video-on-Demand or VoD, the need for bandwidth expansion has become obvious. Zayo owns optical fiber-based bandwidth infrastructure assets that connect the largest U.S. and European cities, as well as many tier 2-5 markets in the U.S. Since bandwidth is a scarce resource, we firmly believe Zayo's bandwidth infrastructure assets have the potential to generate tremendous profits. We'll discuss more about this in the company's valuation segment.Stable Low-Margin Business Complements Main Business The company also offers bandwidth infrastructure solutions over its metro, regional and long-haul fiber networks that generate decent revenues, although it's a relatively low-margin business. The business, which the company calls Lit Services, includes wavelength, Ethernet, IP and SONET services. In addition to serving carriers and banks, this segment also caters to sectors such as healthcare, education and government institutions.Although providing bandwidth infrastructure solutions is a shorter-term contract compared to physical infrastructure, we believe this business helps the company complement its primary physical infrastructure business. Furthermore, this business generates stable recurring revenues that can be used to fund capex for building physical infrastructure.Zayo's ValuationZayo's revenue and adjusted EBITDA both are currently growing at a CAGR of 30%. We believe the company's massive fiber-optic network has the potential to support the adjusted EBITDA growth, although revenue growth may taper off to mid-teens going forward. The company is well-positioned to charge higher prices for its physical infrastructure. As a result, adjusted EBITDA may continue to grow at 30%, even if revenue growth falls.In its S-1 filing, Zayo noted that its adjusted EBITDA margin on incremental revenue is approximately 70%, which results in overall adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 60%, far higher than actual EBITDA margins of peers like Cogent Communications (NASDAQ:CCOI) and Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT). However, since adjusted EBITDA doesn't reflect non-cash stock-based compensation expenses which are significant for Zayo, we believe Zayo's actual EBITDA margin could be at par with peers. Zayo says it offers the industry's best performance-based equity incentives for employees.Nevertheless, we'd like to attach an EV/adjusted EBITDA of 15x to Zayo, since adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow at 30%. Based on FY 2014 adjusted EBITDA of $654 million, the company's enterprise value comes at $9.8 billion or $41 per share with 239 million shares outstanding. After adjusting for debt-load, $40 is our one-year target price for Zayo.Final WordsIn addition to demand for Internet bandwidth, Zayo's performance-based equity incentives for employees and work culture are its additional growth drivers. We'd recommend buying the stock at the current price.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a BB Research stock analyst.

While building these types of lines to such an excess that supply vastly outstripped demand during the telecommunications boom in the 1990s, growing demand for Internet usage has made some lines more valuable. This increasing demand comes primarily from wireless companies seeking faster links.Zayo developed into an organization for private equity and venture capital investors to purchase network assets at bargain basement prices during the telecommunications industry decline in the early 2000s. Zayo has completed over 30 acquisitions, putting together a network of more than 81,000 miles of cable to major European and U.S. metropolitan regions and several smaller cities as well. This includes fiber-optic cable that runs through London's sewer system and a data center facility in Las Vegas.In 2011, Zayo acquired 360Networks, a fiber-industry innovator that filed for bankruptcy in 2001 thereby initiating the telecommunications bust only one year subsequent to floating its IPO.Zayo reported revenue of $1.1 billion for the year ending June 30; however, it also reported a net loss of $179 million.

I'll make the long case for Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZAYO) in just a few simple bullet points:That's it. Shows over. See you next time folks.Of course we know the story is never that simple but that just about sums it up for ZAYO. The company, the story, the model, and the end markets are all really straight forward and I think that's what makes owning this name so easy.For clarity and for those unfamiliar, ZAYO provides bandwidth infrastructure and interconnection services which are as important to today's business and societal ecosystems as electricity is. Yes, that important. Essentially, without ZAYO and the ever-dwindling group of other suppliers of this infrastructure, the entire world shuts down. That's not an exaggeration. Think about trying to exist without high-bandwidth. Think about not having use of your smart phone or your television or just about anything requiring this infrastructure. This is a seriously sticky industry that ZAYO participates in and that has driven the ""arms race"" of acquiring assets that ZAYO has made a strategic focus.Consolidation has become the name of the game in this space and ZAYO has participated in a big way. I detailed at initiation of coverage a list of historic ZAYO acquisitions including a massive $2.2 billion dollar closing that become a large piece of ZAYO's current model. It also became a large piece of ZAYO's substantial debt, which stands at $3.21 billion:Debt, by the way, is something that you're going to have to be comfortable with if you're going to own ZAYO. The company, as stated above, has used debt to become what it has become and it plans on using as much of it as the covenants within its existing debt will allow. Thank goodness, as also stated above, that I don't have to worry about any of this unless I plan on holding the shares 60 months or longer. I'm not saying I don't/won't/couldn't decide on that eventually but I certainly plan on being deep in the money before then:In fact, I'm deep in the money now:ZAYO shares have appreciated ~22% since initiation but have fallen ~20% from peak pricing. This presents the reason for writing this article and the value to be bought by newer longs. Get long ZAYO, get long its easy path to higher pricing, and get long it's easy to see value-prop. Why have shares sold off from the highs? Have you seen the markets? It's been a bloodbath out there and anything new to market or with beta is selling off. Simple beta selling is the reason. Nothing fundamental has changed at ZAYO and primarily for that reason I think readers should take Mr. Market's gift and run with it.Now, getting back to the story of ZAYO, I want to be clear that we're analyzing a CAPEX driven growth story. That's a fact.ZAYO's growth has been driven by organic growth sure but the vast majority of to-date growth has been via acquisition:On a separate and side note before discussing the graphic, another reason to buy ZAYO is smart management. One of the biggest complaints I had with the company at initiation, and so did plenty other analysts, was the lack of granularity in the S-1. Sure, we could have gone to the company's website and sifted through annual reports and other filings but that's what the S-1 is for. It just spoke poorly of the organization of the company and frankly was annoying. Management picked up on this and during its first conference call as a public company put together what I would call a mini-roadshow for those participating. This graphic was a part of that and I think has management back in the good graces of those who cover the company.I think this graphic does a really good job at expressing the slowly shifting model and revenue composition at the company. You can see that up until recently the blue bars were essentially non-existent. Again, ZAYO has been an acquisition story. Recently though, the blue bars have begun to growth and are growing at a faster rate than the orange bars. I'm not saying this will remain in trend or that the orange bars can't be grown much quicker, they can because they're transactional acquisition growth. What I am saying is that ZAYO is evidencing the most important point it can evidence at this point in its maturation: that organic growth can be created and it can be created with consistency. That's huge to continuing the price/sales multiple expansion and huge to showing market participants that eventually this CAPEX growth story can become just a growth story.ZAYO'S Q3 presentation of Adjusted EBITDA confirms these developments and also shows a stable Adjusted EBITDA margin at 58%:I've paid much closer attention to ZAYO's Adjusted figures because they show a more true to reality trend line than the noisy un-Adjusted figures do. With so many acquisitions and financings taking place on such a consistent basis you can imagine the income statement doesn't look as clean as you would want it to look:Yes, we get to see ZAYO's 19.6% quarterly revenue growth but trying to judge how much of that trickles down to the bottom line ex. non-cash and one-time items is a mess here. Share based comp alone in the current and comp figure was greater than total net loss. That's the type of noise I'm referencing.When backing out the above items, which none are operational outside of interest expense - it is even arguable if that is directly an operational expense - you can see a healthy Adjusted EBITDA and a healthy growth rate of 17.6%. Again the margin was 57% for the quarter.Here's an even further look back at the Adjusted EBITDA trend line and the stability of the margin trend line. The actual annualized growth rate has varied quite a bit because of timing of acquisitions but the trend line for volume and margin are solid. This should put to rest any growth concerns that are a part of the bear thesis.The above two graphics show that the two most important metrics to track because of the unusual amount of growth ZAYO has driven by acquisitions are actual dollar revenue growth and actual dollar Adjusted EBITDA. As long as those two trend lines remain going higher and the company isn't burning cash for non-revenue productive spend ZAYO is going to be just fine.The first graphic has been outlined to show just how the annualized revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA growth, and unlevered free cash flow growth rates bounce around. Again, it's all because of timing of acquisitions and that's what causes so much noise in trying to determine company health. But you can see in the second set of graphics Adjusted EBITDA stability, steady builds to PP&E, and relatively steady net capital.Finally, to the point about cash burn, ZAYO has shown a pretty decent amount of stability when it comes to cash provided from operations:This graphic dates back 5 quarters and the cash provided by operations has remained within a fairly tight range considering how big this company is. Clearly, the cash outflow run rate is solely determined at this point by the acquisition schedule so total cash run rate at the company has been impossible to model and is still impossible to model but regardless the operations are generating a good amount of cash flow.You can also see that unlevered free cash flow (Adjusted EBITDA minus CAPEX) has been steady and that Adjusted unlevered free cash flow (unlevered free cash flow minus amortization of deferred revenue plus additions to deferred revenues) has been showing a rising trend line. Whether these figures are valuable depends on your acceptance of non-GAAP measures; typically I'm not the biggest fan of allowing non-GAAP for cash flow unless a significant amount of the current period revenue is constantly deferred, but I agree with the usage in this instance.This graphic might provide a bit cleaner look but is showing the same data:All told, the operations at ZAYO are just fine and the share price has reflected that (especially prior to this macro market driven selloff). I like that.Where's the trade?To summarize, ZAYO is growing at a healthy pace and is generating healthy cash flow on an operational level. ZAYO also has been working hard to position itself to take advantage of a growing end market demand in a space that has been long consolidating but it has had to take on debt to do this. Because of the CAPEX driven growth the income statement has been messy and company health is better viewed via the non-GAAP calculations. In total, ZAYO put together yet another solid, productive quarter that advances the broader story.Post-IPO the company is now well funded to continue executing its strategy:A strategy that has consistently paid early adopters and investors:I continue to recommend a long position in ZAYO and think they finish 2015 much, much higher. I don't want to give a price target because the final pricing in December will largely be dependent on acquisitions, integrations, and synergies realized. Just know that I'm as confident in ZAYO over the longer term as I am with any company in my portfolio. I'm expecting big things.I look forward to providing continuing coverage in the future. Good luck to all."
2588715,48411,2014-10-24T11:26:24-04:00,"ZAYO provides bandwidth infrastructure, a service that is as essential to everyday life as that provided by a utility.ZAYO has a substantial amount of CAPEX and acquisition spending ahead of it over the next few years but those risks don't outweigh the reward of ownership.ZAYO's Adjusted EBITDA numbers show that the company's non-cash loss drivers like D&A and share based comp are skewing the real picture of the company.","Let's call internet service providers and bandwidth infrastructure companies what they really are: utilities. High-speed internet is as essential to everyday life as electricity is. You can bet that if a financial services firm had to choose between having fluorescent light in its office space or its internet connection it would operate indoors by candlelight. No doubt about it: high-speed internet is now an essential need for survival, especially if you operate a business. By the way, in today's world faster data transfer is better - so anything helping produce this effect is going to have plenty of customer demand.That being said, a new wave of quasi-utility companies have taken center stage in America over the last seven years or so. These companies are providing the bandwidth infrastructure needed to transmit the signals needed to operate in today's business environments. Bandwidth infrastructure providers create the paths for the signals to travel via expanded signal frequency ranges and expanded data transfer and rate capacity. These new fixtures of growing importance make it possible for the rest of world to move from grainy pixelated video to HDX. They make it possible for massive files to be sent and downloaded cross country. They make it possible for firms located in 2000 square foot offices to virtually print money as machines trade thousands of times per millisecond. If ever a company would be the recipient of a ""hundred dollar handshake"" it would be bandwidth infrastructure providers - helping keep America's data needs running fast is a service with benefits.Today's article will focus on a newly public bandwidth infrastructure provider, Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZAYO), and how it's piecing together a large part of the supply pie. It will discuss why, while the company is spending in massive size currently, and is highly levered and unprofitable, this position is one you want to take home for the long haul. This article will discuss the growth strategy at ZAYO, the finances as presented in the ZAYO S-1, and the possibility for ZAYO to become a huge name for those who know what they're looking for.Who is ZAYO, how did it grow so fast, and how did it pay for this growth?I love the description of business given in the S-1 and found it to encapsulate the services provided by the company. I'm of the belief that most of the public is familiar with these services. Most of the public understands that signals have to be transferred via fibers as data is converted to light: ""Fiber optic technology converts electrical signals carrying data to light and sends the light through transparent glass fibers about the diameter of a human hair. (SOURCE: fcc.gov)"". This conversion and transmission via fibers makes transmission much faster than older legacy options and has allowed users of data to reach the next level of productivity. In ZAYO's customers' worlds that means helping generate revenue and in that revenue generation lies the value prop for the company.ZAYO has pieced the majority of its operations together via acquisition. It's remained busy throughout its operating history and plans to continue to acquire growth going forward. Its purchase of AboveNet in July of 2012 comprises the majority of its current assets and operations and had a sticker price north of $2.2 billion. This is not a company that is afraid to spend to grow. This is a fundamental pillar in the strategy both short and mid-term; so be comfortable with the company operating with a huge amount of debt for the duration of any medium-length holds.Consistent Growth by Acquisition:The total debt situation should get a little better in the short-term if ZAYO goes through with a portion of its IPO use of proceeds intention (one of many possible intentions for funds) of ""redemption of up to 35% of our outstanding 10.125% senior unsecured notes due 2020 at a redemption price of 110.125% and 8.125% senior secured notes due 2020 at a redemption price of 108.125%, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date (SOURCE: ZAYO S-1)"".I expect ZAYO to do this in an effort to either refinance other portions of its debt or secure more borrowing capacity for a mid-term acquisition or organic expansion run. Even if ZAYO decides to wait on trying to secure more borrowing capacity the fact is that as revenues grow - and I think they will grow - ZAYO will most certainly do this later down the road. It's going to need help financing operations in the short and mid-term to allow its front-end expenses to be met with matching revenues derived from those expenses; it only makes sense for the company to secure this borrowing capacity as early as possible.Total Debt:Cash Growth via Financing, Total Asset Growth via Acquisition, and Total Debt Growth:The good news is that the majority of ZAYO's debt is out at least 61 months which should give operations plenty of time to grow into the debt maintenance and future, larger borrowing needs. I can't be certain that ZAYO will need more borrowing capacity that far out or that ZAYO won't be the beneficiary of industry tailwinds or margin expansion greater than currently anticipated. But based on the acquisition-happy history and management's stated initiative of growth by CAPEX and acquisition, I think if ZAYO had its choice it would be in a position to borrow more, refinance debt further down the road, and carry on aggregating market share. The point so far is that while ZAYO is levered up and has substantial debt maintenance expenses, the company is on stable footing and should be able to decrease the maintenance expenses as a percentage of revenue (this is very dependent on the speed of acquisitions) going forward.Contractual Obligations By Year:OperationsAdmittedly, operations are going to be hard to discuss in terms of efficiency because of the lack of clarity that ZAYO provides (admittedly, this is very hard to do). It is difficult to distinguish between organic growth, acquired growth, and growth created because of synergies and operating leverage created by acquisition, meaning growth that wouldn't have been there or would have been there in smaller size prior to the acquisition.That said, I think that the story of ZAYO right now isn't about growth operationally as much as it is winning the bandwidth infrastructure arms race. I think in five years the investment community will look back and consider what a great strategy it was for ZAYO to shoot first and ask questions last when it came to acquisitions. Even knowing that, I'm happy with and fairly impressed with ZAYO's operations and growth considering the amount of implementation the company has had to do since inception.Accelerating Losses?: Again, I don't know how much granular analysis can be taken from the income statement at this point, even dating it back to 2010, because of the amount of outside activities that have taken place, but the general trend lines of a growth by spending story are there. Revenues have grown at a 45 degree angle to the right (that's a very good thing) and so have expenses with expenses greatly outpacing revenues. This has created a quickly growing and substantial net loss. Now, large pieces of the net loss are non-cash including share based comp and depreciation as 1) ZAYO has made it a point to pay employees in stock to force tied interest between shareholder and employee; and 2) as a large percentage of ZAYO's assets are derived from P&PE - this creates an incredible amount of D&A. I think this makes Adjusted EBITDA a more relevant visual of company health but like I said above I'm not judging company health exclusively on operations at this point. As long as ZAYO isn't showing to be hemorrhaging cash for non-revenue productive reasons, tripping debt covenants, or having product obsolescence I'm OK to let the company stretch its legs into some losses if that means market share aggregation.Before moving to Adjusted EBITDA, a look at the revenue and expense by segment might provide a bit of granularity that readers can use for modeling:Healthy Primary Segment Growth - up 20% Y/Y:Significant Share Based Comp and D&A Expense Driving Expenses:Still, Adjusted EBITDA has been growing and is being acquired which should give post-IPO investors at least some level of comfort in the ""trust me"" story I'm pitching. (For clarity, I'm not asking you to trust me; ZAYO is, as its plans ask the shareholder to take on substantial risk):Adjusted EBITDA Showing Smart Acquisitions:A further look into Adjusted EBITDA with a breakdown of the figures by segment. Again, I want to stress heavily that the adjustments being made are the furthest thing from egregious; most of what ZAYO is adding back is non-cash (D&A, share based comp). I really think the Adjusted EBITDA numbers, the granularity with which ZAYO presents them, and by way of that the transparency it helps create into the reportings makes them a reliable indicator of health. I think ZAYO looks really good looking at these graphics and it looks like whatever formula the company has for identifying and executing acquisitions has worked:Segment Growth of Adjusted EBITDA = Acquisition Formula Success:The final note I'll have readers make in regards to the operations is one that required a bit of explanation. So, at this point we know that the overwhelming majority of the losses on ZAYO's books are coming from D&A and share based comp - both non-cash line items that are backed out of the cash flow statement. It's very important to keep the non-cash line items separate from the cash ones.We also know that ZAYO has a history of losses and losses that are accelerating as the company expands. The company is expanding by using its cash, that has been depleting its C&CE. That account has been replenished time and time again by debt raised via financing (often times the financing vehicles have already been on the books but ZAYO has decided to access them). These are real cash outflows; actual dollars going out the door for real assets like fiber mileage and other infrastructure items.This growth strategy (growth by CAPEX and acquisition) is one that I'll get long even knowing the substantial investments the company is going to continue to make (read: I'm going to have live with the idea that ZAYO is levered up). Because eventually, and I think this is within the next two years (depending on the speed and scale of acquisitions), when ZAYO is profitable it can use its massive and growing net operating loss carryforward to offset actual cash gains (which will still be partially offset by non-cash items). What that means is when ZAYO actually does turn the corner on profitability, which the Adjusted EBITDA graphics show us is closer than indicated on the income statement, the company should be able to avoid tax liabilities in size for at least the first few years. Talk about a jumpstart out of the profitability gate. I know that's taking a very long term view of ownership of shares but it is what it is. I plan to own this name a long time.Where's the trade?It's always important to indicate that a company will have a ""bumpy"" road along its growth path in this section so that readers understand that volatility will be there each and every day. It's funny though, when I think about the business of ZAYO I wonder exactly how bumpy the road will be. Sure, ZAYO is going to have to continue to integrate acquisitions as it goes and it does have the debt albatross to worry about paying years down the road. But, as I said in the intro, I like the idea that ZAYO's assets have become necessary to everyday life. I also like the idea that the company was put together to do exactly what it is doing: acquire as large a space in the early days of this valuable service as possible. I like the idea that this company saw where industry was going and not where it was.For me to buy a CAPEX driven, acquisition happy growth story the financials, the balance sheet, and the industry prospects better check out. I think they do with ZAYO. I'll look to initiate a position by the end of the week.I look forward to providing continuing coverage in the future. Good luck to all."

ZAYO's products and services enable mission-critical, high-bandwidth applications, such as cloud-based computing, video, mobile, social media, machine-to-machine connectivity, and other bandwidth-intensive applications.Market growthThe growth of cloud-based computing, video, mobile and social media applications, machine-to-machine connectivity, and other bandwidth-intensive applications continues to drive rapidly increasing consumption of bandwidth on a global basis.Cisco estimates that, from 2013 to 2018, mobile data traffic will grow at an annual rate of 61% and that IP traffic will grow at an annual rate of 21% through 2018.Additionally, according to Gartner in its November 18, 2013 report, Forecast: The Internet of Things, Worldwide, 2013, ""[t]he installed base of 'things,' excluding PCs, tablets and smartphones, will grow to 26 billion units in 2020, which is almost a 30-fold increase from 0.9 billion units in 2009.""ConsolidatorAs a core tenet of its strategy for capitalizing on these industry trends, ZAYO has been a leading consolidator in the industry and have acquired 32 bandwidth infrastructure businesses and assets to date. ZAYO's owned, secure, and redundant fiber network and datacenters serve as the foundation for its bandwidth solutions and allows it to offer customers both physical infrastructure and lit services.ProductsKey products include leased dark fiber, fiber to cellular towers and small cell sites, dedicated wavelength connections, Ethernet and IP connectivity and other high-bandwidth offerings.ZAYO provides its services over a unique set of dense metro, regional, and long-haul fiber networks and through its interconnect-oriented datacenter facilities.ZAYO's fiber networks and datacenter facilities are critical components of the overall physical network architecture of the Internet and private networks.CustomersZAYO's customer base includes some of the largest and most sophisticated consumers of bandwidth infrastructure services, such as wireless service providers; telecommunications service providers; financial services companies; social networking, media, and web content companies; education, research, and healthcare institutions; and governmental agencies.ZAYO typically provides its bandwidth infrastructure services for a fixed monthly recurring fee under contracts that vary between one and twenty years in length.As of June 30, 2014, ZAYO had more than $4.6 billion in revenue under contract with a weighted average remaining contract term of approximately 43 months.ZAYO operates its business with a unique focus on capital allocation and financial performance with the ultimate goal of maximizing equity value for its stockholders.Financial overviewFor the years ended June 30, 2012, 2013, and 2014, ZAYO generated revenue of $376 million, $1,004 million, and $1,123 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $188 million, $554 million, and $654 million and a net loss of $1 million, $137 million, and $179 million, respectively.For the quarter ended June 30, 2014, ZAYO generated annualized revenue of $1,187 million and annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $684 million.HistoryZAYO was founded in 2007 with the investment thesis of building a bandwidth infrastructure platform to take advantage of the favorable Internet, data, and wireless growth trends driving the demand for bandwidth infrastructure, and to be an active participant in the consolidation of the industry.Dividend PolicyNo dividends are planned.Intellectual PropertyZAYO does not own any significant intellectual property, nor do ZAYO spend a material amount on research and development. ZAYO's working capital requirements and expansion needs have been satisfied to date through CII members' equity contributions, debt issuances, and cash provided by operating activities.CompetitionGiven the requirement to own the underlying bandwidth infrastructure assets (e.g., fiber networks and datacenter facilities) in order to provide physical infrastructure services, the competitive environment tends to be less intensive for these products and the barriers to entry high. The degree of competition and actual competitive parties do vary by physical infrastructure sub-service and by individual market and fiber route. The competitive situation by service is described as follows:Dark Fiber. Competition in dark fiber services tends to be less intense than for lit bandwidth infrastructure services primarily because a provider must predominantly own and operate a high count fiber network covering a substantial portion of the geographical demand in order to compete for a customer's business.The uniqueness, density and depth (i.e, high fiber count) of ZAYO's metro, regional, and long-haul fiber networks is therefore a key differentiating factor.In addition, given that providing dark fiber services often includes some degree of network expansion, dark fiber providers must also have internal project management expertise and access to capital to execute on the expansion aspect of the business.Due to the custom nature of most dark fiber opportunities, many larger lit bandwidth infrastructure providers do not actively market dark fiber as a product, even if they own fiber networks in the desired geographies.As a result, competition is often more limited in the dark fiber services market and highly dependent on the local (even sub-market) supply and demand environment. Given this dynamic and the generally longer contractual term of dark fiber services, dark fiber pricing tends to be more inflationary in nature.Specific dark fiber competitors vary significantly based on geography, and often a particular solution can be provided by only one to three carriers that have sufficient fiber in place in the desired area or route.These competitors tend to fall into two categories: first, privately owned regional bandwidth infrastructure providers with a similar degree of focus (e.g., Fibertech, Lightower, and Sunesys) and second, single market dark fiber providers with market and fiber construction expertise (e.g., DQE Communications and Edison Carrier Solutions).Mobile Infrastructure. Competition in mobile infrastructure services tends to mirror dark fiber services because of the need to own and operate an expansive and deep metro fiber network in order to compete.Given the frequent need to expand upon an existing fiber footprint in order to access additional cell towers and small cell locations, project management expertise and access to capital is also a key competitive factor.One additional criteria is that wireless carriers prefer to work with a more finite group of mobile infrastructure providers on either a metro or regional geographic basis.As a result, the competitive group tends to match that of dark fiber services, with the addition of two competitive groups.First, local cable providers and ILECs who will often break from their retail and small enterprise core focus to compete for FTT business, often as a result of legacy copper or coaxial-based services provided to these towers.Second, microwave backhaul providers who focus on more remote or rural towers that have lesser bandwidth needs that they can serve with less capital-intensive (and less bandwidth-capable) microwave solutions at a lower total cost.Examples of these additional mobile infrastructure competitors are Comcast, Time Warner Cable, CenturyLink, PEG Bandwidth, Conterra and TTMI.Colocation. The market for ZAYO's colocation and interconnection services is very competitive.ZAYO competes based on price, quality of service, network-neutrality, breadth of network connectivity options, type and quantity of customers in its datacenters, and location.ZAYO competes against both large, public colocation providers who have significant enterprise values, and privately-held, well-funded companies.Some of ZAYO's competitors have longer-standing customer relationships and significantly greater access to capital, which may enable them to materially increase datacenter space, and therefore lower overall market pricing for such services.Several of ZAYO's competitors have much larger colocation facilities in the markets where ZAYO operates. Others operate globally and are able to attract a customer base that values and requires global reach and scale.5% stockholdersBattery Ventures 6.5%Charlesbank Capital Partners 10.7%Columbia Capital 11.4%Communications Infrastructure Investments, LLC 7.3%GTCR 20.2%M/C Partners 11.4%Oak Investment Partners 12.3%Use of proceedsDM intends to use the $232 million in proceeds from its IPO as follows:for general corporate purposes, which may include redemption of up to 35% of its outstanding 10.125% senior unsecured notes due 2020 at a redemption price of 110.125% and 8.125% senior secured notes due 2020 at a redemption price of 108.125%, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date; acquisitions; working capital; and capital expenditures.Although ZAYO is always evaluating attractive bandwidth infrastructure acquisitions, ZAYO has not at this time identified any acquisition candidate for which ZAYO intends to use a portion of the proceeds of this offering.

Davidson, Oppenheimer, Raymond James, RBC Capital, Stephens Inc., SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Wells Fargo, William Blair.Summary: Large Provider of Bandwidth Infrastructure in Europe and the U.S.ZAYO is a fast growing, large provider of bandwidth infrastructure in throughout Europe and the U.S. Their services and products facilitate high-bandwidth, mission-critical applications including video, cloud-based computing, social media, machine-to-machine connectivity, mobile and other bandwidth intensive products and services. Key products include fiber to cellular towers, leased dark fiber, small cell sites, Ethernet and IP connectivity and dedicated wavelength connections.ZAYO delivers its services via a unique group of dense regional, metro and long haul fiber networks and via the company's inter-connected data centers. Their data centers and fiber networks are crucial components of the entire physical architecture of private networks and the Internet.Their client base includes many of the largest and most technologically sophisticated users of bandwidth infrastructure services including telecommunications providers, wireless service providers, social networking, web and media content businesses, research and healthcare institutions, education, governmental agencies and financial services companies.Typically, ZAYO sells its bandwidth infrastructure services through contracts that secure a recurring fee. Generally these contracts range from one to twenty years in duration. As of June 30, 2014, ZAYO held contracts in excess of $4.6 billion in revenue. Currently, the weighted average remaining term of the contracts equals 43 months. ZAYO operates its business with a focus on financial performance and capital allocation with the goal of maximizing stockholder equity. The company states that its core values center on alignment, transparency and partnership with their three primary constituents-customers, employees and stockholders.ZAYO's network footprint includes small and large metro areas, the extensive suburban regions outside large metropolitan areas, and the large international, national and rural links that connect their metro networks. The company believes that the network assets would be challenging to replicate or replace considering the network density, geographic reach and capital investment required. ZAYO's fiber networks cover over 6,000,000 fiber miles and 81,000 route miles. It provides service to 319 geographic markets, connects to more than 15,700 buildings, 756 data centers and 4,200 cell towers. The company owns fiber networks in more than 300 metro markets, including London, Paris, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York, as well as smaller regions including Fargo, North Dakota, Allentown Pennsylvania, and Spokane, Washington.Potential Competition Faces a Competitive Environment with High Barriers to EntryBecause of the necessity of owning the fiber networks, underlying bandwidth infrastructure and data centers, the marketplace has a less intensive competitive environment with high barriers to entry. The degree of competition varies upon the individual market, sub-service and fiber route.Typically, price competition will vary based on the size and location of the marketplace. ZAYO faces direct competition from fiber-based companies that have networks serving the same geographical and consumer base. Specific competitors include well-capitalized ILECs, such as CenturyLink, AT&T and Verizon Communications.Valuation: Increasing LossesZAYO offers the following figures in its S-1 earnings statement for the year ended June 30, 2014:Revenue: $1,123,187,000Net Loss: ($179,294,000)While revenues have steadily increased, total operating costs and expenses have increased further, from 2012-2014.ZAYO offers the following figures in its S-1 earnings statement for the year ended June 30, 2014:Total Assets: $5,049,066,000Total Liabilities: $4,632,481,000Stockholders' Equity: $416,385,000Conclusion: Consider Holding OffWhile demand for ZAYO's services should remain strong, we are concerned about strong competition, along with ZAYO's increasing losses.We invite readers wishing to join the discussion on IPOs to click the +FOLLOW button above the title of this article, and those looking for thelatest updates to click +Get real-time alerts."

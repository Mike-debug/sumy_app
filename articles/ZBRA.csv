Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) has been one of my favorite cyclical stocks for some time. The company has been a tremendous outperformed in the past and is currently only down 4.9% year-to-date. It only takes the stock slightly more than 7% to return to its previous all-time highs. The company just reported its first-quarter earnings, which came in above expectations despite significant weakness in Asia. While the second quarter will without any doubt be worse due to the shutdowns that started at the end of Q1 in Western-Europe and the United States, I think Zebra is a great stock to buy as soon as we get another sell-off.Source: Zebra TechnologiesUnfortunately, Zebra Technologies is still flying under the radar despite its phenomenal track record. Therefore, I will start this article by quickly telling you what Zebra is about if you are new to this stock. Note that this part is from my article written in June of last year.With this in mind, let's take a look at the first quarter.Let's start by taking a look at the company's (historical) earnings per share results. Prior to the just-released first-quarter results, the company reported double-digit earnings per share growth in every single quarter. This rapidly changed in the first quarter as earnings per share fell to $2.67. While this is above expectations of $2.64, it is down 9% compared to the prior-year quarter and the first decline of the cycle.Source: EstimizeBefore I continue, it is important to mention that Zebra Technologies generates roughly 80% of its sales in North America and EMEA countries. These countries went into lockdown in March. These lockdown rules were eased at the start of May. In other words, you will see that results in Europe and North America are better than i.e. APAC and we will see a much worse second quarter.That said, first-quarter net sales were down 1.3% to $1.05 billion. Organic sales growth was declined by 0.8%. The enterprise visibility & mobility segment saw organic sales decline by 2.9%. Asset intelligence & tracking organic growth was up 3.2%.As I already mentioned, the West did much better than the East. Organic sales in North America were unchanged. In EMEA countries, organic growth was up 7%. APAC countries, however, saw 21% lower organic growth. Latin America was down 11%.As a result, adjusted EBITDA was down 10.7% as the adjusted EBITDA margin declined by 200 basis points to 19.1%. Negative effects from tariffs, expedited freight, and unfavorable business mix more than offset lower operating expenses.Fortunately, Zebra did provide us with some guidance, although full-year sales, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow guidance has been withdrawn. In the second quarter, management expects net sales to decline between 11% and 17%. While this range is large, I had expected sales to decline more than that. While that's still a possibility, it once again shows the company's strength to large parts of its customer base in a lockdown.While I do not expect that Zebra is going to enter a situation so bad that sales are going to implode, it's worth noting that the company has great financial health. AS of the first quarter, the company has $1.4 billion total debt. Liquidity consists of $24 million in cash and $740 million capacity under its revolving credit facility. The company's net-debt/adjusted-EBITDA ratio is 1.5. While that's healthy, the company has a current ratio of roughly 0.85. Meaning that current assets only cover 85% of current liabilities. While this has not been a problem in the past, it will only become a problem if the company is unable to use its revolving credit facility - which will not happen. In other words, I am not at all worried about the company.The worst thing about this earnings season is the total lack of guidance and insights. Don't get me wrong, I am not blaming anyone as these are unprecedented times. However, the best thing about earnings season has always been to get insights from various companies to not only assess whether a company is doing the right thing, but also to better understand certain industries. With regard to Zebra, I consider the data the company provided its investors to be proof that its business deserves to be an outperformer. Right now, the company is on track to reach new all-time highs within two weeks if the current trend continues. However, I am not going to advise you to buy. I think the economy is entering a VVV-shaped recovery. The economy will more than likely remain weak for the remainder of the year and maybe even the start of 2021 as there has simply been too much damage over the past few weeks. Sure, Q3 will easily outperform Q2 due to looser restrictions, but I do not think we are able to enter a sustainable recovery unless everyone feels safe again - as vague as that might sound.Source: FINVIZRegardless, my strategy is to buy outperformers and companies with secular tailwinds to benefit from a market that will likely hover around 2900 points (S&P 500) for at least one to two quarters. Zebra is one of these stocks. I will likely buy if the stock dips 10%. Right now, I am not willing to chase the stock this close to its highs. If you want long-term industrial exposure, make sure to move this stock to your watchlist. That way you will be able to pull the trigger as soon as the stock shows weakness again.Be safe!Thank you very much for reading my article.

4363766,25120,2020-08-03T08:46:37-04:00,"Zebra Technologies sees sales declines recover rapidly.The company is furthermore announcing an interesting bolt-on deal, as the company moves more towards software.Secular growth, solid dealmaking and move to software is to be applauded, yet valuations have become a bit full again.","Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) is a very interesting name which initially sold off amidst the initial COVID-19 scare. Yet, as it turns out, it could be a major beneficiary of the same situation, with e-commerce sales accelerating and smart tools required for social distancing, among others.Operating in secular growth markets, the company furthermore benefits from savvy management which has an excellent track record in dealmaking. With shares trading at fresh all-time highs, expectations are a bit lofty, yet shares certainly look interesting on potential dips.As Zebra does not receive a great deal of coverage on this platform, let's first introduce the business. The company calls itself an EAI solutions provider (Enterprise Asset Intelligence). The company's products and solutions allow for automatic identification and data capturing. Products and services include barcode scanners, RFID readers, specialty printers, labels as well as service contracts on this equipment, as well as cloud-based solutions and subscription models. The company is active across the globe in industries like retail, e-commerce, transportation & logistics, manufacturing, warehousing and many other applications.In general, the products and services of the company have been in great demand in recent years. Over the past decade, the company has grown from about a billion in sales to $4.5 billion, all while keeping normalized operating margins steady around 15% of sales. The big growth mostly stems from dealmaking, in particular the $3.5 billion deal for Motorola Solutions' Enterprise business, which almost entirely was funded with debt. Cheap debt financing and operating leverage did prevent dilution of the shareholder basis and has been the driver for major shareholder value being created.After all, this was just a $20 stock in 2008 with shares rising to levels around $120 in early 2015, just after the Motorola deal closed as some operational struggles and financial concerns put shares back to $50 in the summer of 2016. As the business turned, shares kept rising in a steady and impressive fashion, and while of course exhibiting some volatility surrounding COVID-19, shares now trade at fresh all-time highs around $280 at the moment.To get a clue where we are, let's go back to February when Zebra Technologies reported its 2019 results. The company grew full-year sales by 6.3% to $4.49 billion, with fourth-quarter growth coming in at nearly 5%.The company reported net earnings of $544 million, a 29% increase compared to the year before which translated into diluted earnings of $9.97 per share. GAAP earnings were based on operating profits of $692 million, yet these earnings were impacted by a combined $135 million in amortization, acquisition and restructuring costs, of which the majority is explained by amortization charges.The company reported adjusted earnings of $706 million, about $160 million more than the GAAP numbers, with adjusted earnings reported at $12.94 per share. Note that $60 million of the discrepancy stems from stock-based compensation expenses which I am not happy to adjust for, so realistically, I peg earnings round $12 per share.The balance sheet is quite resilient as well with EBITDA for 2019 coming in at $970 million as this metric exceeded the billion mark on an annualised basis in the fourth quarter. With net debt of $1.25 billion by end of 2019, leverage ratios are very modest at 1.3 times.Absence of COVID-19, the company guided for 2020 sales growth around 5%, plus or minus a point with very modest margin expansion expected.Late April, Zebra reported its first-quarter results. First-quarter sales fell just over a percent, but as COVID-19 only had an impact on the tail of the quarter, these results are not representative of the COVID-19 impact. Softer demand in China, supply chain disruptions and start of the COVID-19 hardly had an impact on sales, yet certainly put pressure on margins (to the tune of 2%). Net debt rose a bit toward $1.38 billion. Based on first-quarter annualised EBITDA down towards $800 million, leverage ratios have moved higher to 1.7 times (although lower on a trailing basis), still very reasonable. Adjusted earnings fell 9% to $2.67 per share.The company guided for second-quarter sales to fall just 11-17%, to be accompanied by some margin pressure, as the adjusted earnings guidance of $2.10-$2.50 per share is quite comforting, marking just little pressure compared to the first-quarter numbers.Second-quarter results were released at the end of July with revenues down nearly 13% on an annual basis, up a bit better than originally expected, as the same applies for the adjusted earnings of $2.41 per share. The company performed well in terms of cash flow generation, with net debt down to $1.16 billion. Based on EBITDA trending at $700 million a year, leverage ratios are flat at 1.7 times.Encouraging is that third-quarter sales are seen down just 3-7%, with adjusted earnings per share seen at $2.65-$2.95 per share. With revenues recovering quickly, it seems that Zebra is actually benefiting in some sectors such as logistics and e-commerce which are thriving in this environment.Alongside the second-quarter earnings report, Zebra announced the acquisition of Reflexis Systems. Reflexis is a provider of intelligent workforce management, execution and communion solutions. Clients are typically found in retail, food, hospitality and banking. Zebra is specifically attracted to the software portfolio as Reflexis ONE allows for measurable improvements in engagement, productivity and retention.The added software capabilities means that there is a strategic angle to the deal as it does not come cheap. Zebra is paying $575 million in a deal set to close in the fourth quarter of this year, with an immaterial impact on earnings per share upon closure, although accretive thereafter.The company generated $66 million in sales in 2019, which makes that the activities are valued at 8.7 times sales. To put this multiple into perspective, Zebra is valued at an enterprise value close to $16 billion at these levels, just under 4 times annualised sales. Nonetheless, there are a few items to justify the deal and its price tag, including gross margins being 20 points higher than Zebra itself while the company has doubled its sales over the past three years. Furthermore, management has built up some real credits on dealmaking in recent years of course.Net debt will jump to $1.73 billion at this point in time. While adjusted EBITDA fell to an annualised $700 million number in the second quarter, further improvements are seen in the third quarter as the pending deal will make an $800 million run rate very realistic, resulting in leverage ratios just above 2 times.Do not get me wrong, I think that Zebra is a wonderful company with a great track record. Besides operating in solid organic growth markets, the company and management have a solid dealmaking track record. Moreover, the company is a premium beneficiary of further growth in online shopping and commerce, as its products and services are used across warehouses all over the globe. Furthermore, its solutions help warehouse and retail workers to work more effectively as well, all while allowing organizations to keep better track of capacity and employee performance, while limiting mistakes.With the company realistically earning $12 per share based on the 2019 results, the current conditions are not really representative for the earnings power as 2020 is still set to become a very profitable year. Based on the 2019 numbers, shares trade at 23 times annualised earnings which is not very cheap, yet this is a secular growth story with reasonable leverage. Additionally, a few software initiatives and acquisitions have the potential to boost margins and accelerate growth. At these levels, quite some good news has been priced in already, yet the company most certainly deserves a place on my watch list in case of renewed sell-offs."
4331109,104812,2020-03-11T04:15:19-04:00,"Zebra Technologies is a leader in automatic identification and data capture that includes barcode scanners, specialty labeling, and related software.The company is profitable and free-cash-flow positive but exposed to cyclical risks, given customer base in industrial and retail segments.A selloff from highs earlier in the year may represent a buying opportunity for steady growth and reasonable valuation.","Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), with a market cap of $10 billion, is a leader in automatic identification and data capture that includes barcode scanners, specialty labeling, and related software. Zebra is benefiting from trends in cloud computing, enterprise mobility, and automation as it continues to innovate with new products and solutions. The company reported Q4 results back in February with a record year for earnings despite a challenging macroenvironment in 2019 with weaker trends in the Asia-Pacific region. This year, the ongoing coronavirus outbreak represents a new headwind but we think the current selloff in shares of ZBRA can represent a buying opportunity for a high-quality tech stock at a reasonable valuation.(Source: finviz.com)Zebra Technologies reported its fiscal Q4 earnings on February 13 with non-GAAP EPS of $3.56 which missed expectations by $0.09. Similarly, quarterly revenue at $1.19 billion was up by 4.4% year over year but $10 million below the estimates. The company highlighted an overall strong performance in the U.S. and EMEA regions while China was more tepid, continuing trends observed along 2019.(Source: Company IR)Financially, this was a solid year for the company. GAAP EPS climbed 28.5% compared to 2018 while the non-GAAP EPS measure reached $12.94, up 17.5% year over year. While EPS reached a record level, gross margin was pressured based on tariff-related expenses leading Zebra to prioritize certain products impacting the product mix. Nevertheless, the adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter and the full year increased, driving higher net income. Management made the following comments in the conference call summarizing the results:One of the highlights of Q4 was Zebra's acquisition of Cortexica Vision Systems in November. The company specializes in visual analytics through artificial intelligence solutions that include object recognition and machine learning. The deal is an example of Zebra's commitment to innovation and remaining the market leader in identification.Zebra notes its market leadership position in barcode printing with a market share of over 40%. The separate software integration solutions or Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (EVM) was the largest segment with $3.0 billion in revenue last year, including enterprise mobile computing and data capture each with a 50% and 30% market share. The industries served are diversified across retail and e-commerce, manufacturing, logistics and healthcare, among others. Keep in mind this is more than simply ""barcode scanners,"" the solutions include specialty and proprietary equipment along with integrated software as a supply-chain management tool.(Source: Company IR)Zebra ended the year with $30 million in cash against $1.3 billion in total debt. A current ratio of 0.85x was pressured during the quarter, given its acquisition of Cortexica along with other deals in 2019 totaling $262 million. Separately, Zebra also repaid $312 million in debt and repurchased $47 million in its share buyback program. The important factor is that the company generates strong levels of operating cash flow which reached $685 million in 2019 while reporting a free cash flow level of $624 million. Zebra ended the year with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA multiple of 1.3x, which is expected to improve going forward.Management issued fiscal Q1 and full-year guidance. For 2020, net sales growth is expected to be in a range between 4% and 6%, with smaller offsetting positive and negative impacts from acquired businesses and FX variations. Adjusted EBITDA margin ""slightly higher than 22%"" if confirmed represents an improvement from 21.6% in 2019. The free-cash-flow target of ""at least $700 million"" compares to $624 million last year.(Source: Company IR)Notably, there was also a comment about the potential impact of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Management sees a $0-50 million hit to sales if the situation deteriorates from current projections. For context, $50 million represents about 1% of full-year sales. Further comments in the conference call suggested the situation remains fluid with a great deal of uncertainty. Remember that these comments were made back in February when the outbreak was more or less localized in China. By this measure, the situation has already deteriorated in the period since. Management cites a large order backlog and flexible supply chain it feels can mitigate any effects.Longer-term, management sees a total addressable market opportunity of $25 billion globally that can be met through its ongoing expansion. An existing core market space of $10 billion is +2x 2019 revenues of $4.5 billion. The trends here include a combination of underlying organic growth of 4-5% per year and an evolving portfolio of solutions to address new uses in mobile computing and data capture.(Source: Company IR)In terms of market consensus expectations, revenue growth this year of 5.16% to $4.72 billion should support a stronger EPS growth at 8.3% to $14.08 per share. In 2021, the market is also positive with an expectation that revenue growth can rebound to a 6.8% year-over-year rate and EPS can reach $15.86.(Source: Seeking Alpha Premium)We like Zebra Technologies as a market leader and think the business benefits from fundamental tailwinds being the trends like cloud computing, internet-of-things, mobility, and information on demand. Zebra is likely to maintain organic growth opportunities as companies continue to transition towards the digitalization of supply chains and inventory management.(Source: Company IR)Zebra is unique as a pure-play on automatic identification at least among the U.S. traded stocks while several other companies also feature competing technologies. Notably, industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is recognized as a direct competitor with a line of identification scanners and related products. Separately, Italy-based 'Datalogic S.p.A ' is a market leader in Europe. Globally, the market is fragmented with smaller specialty and niche solution providers. Zebra's advantage is its partner relationships with the products tending to have a ""sticky"" ecosystem. Customers already using one line of products will typically stay with Zebra when expanding into other solutions.Beyond the current coronavirus outbreak and historical level of market volatility, we are bullish on Zebra as a reasonably valued growth play in tech. Considering 2020 consensus estimates, the stock is trading at 13.7x forward earnings, 10.8x EV to forward EBITDA and 16.9x on 2019 free cash flow. These levels are in the context of the stock already selling off 26% from its 2020 highs at $260 in early January, likely discounting the negative impact of the ongoing disruptions globally.Data by YChartsWhile the current consensus is that there will be an eventual containment of the virus, our concern is that the timetable for when economic activity can return to normal is unclear. We expect Zebra, along with the broader stock market, to continue trading with high levels of volatility until more clarity can be developed and a path for recovery established.That being said, the risk here is that the current situation evolves into a recessionary environment with deeper structural impacts on the global economy that could open up more downside as growth expectations need to be reset. Considering the industries Zebra serves, the company is exposed to cyclical trends in its various markets.We're looking at the 2019 low of the stock around $165 as representing a strong buy level, which we see as possible should current market conditions continue. Buying shares at a lower price simply improves the risk and reward setup. To the upside, our price target for 2020 at $230 per share represents approximately 20% upside from the current level. Any investor interested in this stock should consider a small allocation and average into a position over days and weeks.Zebra Technologies is a quality company and leader of its market segment, benefiting from several fundamental tailwinds in data mobility and automation. We like the stock as it trades at a reasonable valuation for steady growth and positive free cash flow. Considering the current market environment and uncertainty related to the coronavirus outbreak, we expect continued volatility but see any extended downside as a buying opportunity."
4293181,21815,2019-09-24T05:18:02-04:00,"Zebra Technologies enjoys powerful tailwinds with the increasing digitalization of business.Even in a soft economy the company can keep growing as its solutions enable its customers to cut cost and increase productivity and inform decision making.Operational leverage, strong cash generation and reducing debt will ensure earnings growth well ahead of revenue growth.","We think Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) is still attractive as the company enjoys powerful tailwinds. Operational leverage and increasing cash flow ensure earnings growth substantially above revenue growth.Here is what we argued on November 19 last year:Well, indeed they ran a little further:It's time to revisit the growth vectors:The backdrop for the company is the tailwind coming from the increasing digitalization of business, driven by multiple vectors. From the earnings deck:The company is in the intelligent automation business, automating the capture, analysis and decision of data (""sense, analyze, act"" in the company's presentations), making assets visible digitally which enables to improve their usage, increasing process efficiency. From the Q2CC:Basically it's part of the digital transformation of enterprise, providing more transparency to decision making (whether management or frontline employees) to provide data to make better decisions which allow them to optimize processes and workflows.A related tailwind is that companies are putting more technology down the organization to get real-time info into the front-line and in the field, stimulating both the company's hardware and software sales.The company has a host of solutions and products, but it's continuing to add new ones developed organically or through acquisitions, like for instance the Savanna Data Services:This is also a good example of their gradual shift towards more software, and higher margins and recurring revenues which the Q2CC summed up:Another example is its SmartPack, which already has a growing pipeline of pilot projects.This also opens up new verticals and use cases. (Q2CC):The company is also adding other verticals, like public safety. (Q2CC):Acquisitions are another way for the company to add capabilities, products, services, use cases and verticals. The last three acquisitions were:These acquisitions fit into the company's value proposition. From the earnings deck:Profitect in particular is very interesting:This suggests a very nice fit and applicability in other verticals, but it's the more generic machine learning and prescriptive analytics capabilities that are really valuable for a company like Zebra, aiding its push to become more software oriented. Additional color from the Q2CC (our emphasis):Acquisitions broaden their portfolio of solutions and this also enables the company to address new verticals, like the Xplore acquisition. (Q2CC):SA contributor Thomas Hughes has discussed the competition, so for that part we refer you to his excellent article.From the earnings deck:Pretty satisfying results containing continued leverage, with the healthcare and retail sectors as the biggest drivers. Here is a disaggregated look from the 10-Q:Services and software have only crept up 10bp to 12.2% of revenue, which is a bit disappointing. It's much more relevant for the EVM (Enterprise Visibility & Mobility) segment, where it increased 80bp to 14.8% of revenue, snail's pace.From the earnings deck:With guidance staying the same but the company expecting 50bp additional adverse FX impact, in essence guidance is improving with 50bp organic growth.Data by YChartsThe adjusted gross margin improved 100bp in Q2 (y/y) and this is due to multiple factors, one of which is that software is gradually increasing as part of sales.The adjusted EBITDA and operational leverage are mostly due to the company maintaining a good grip on cost.Data by YChartsThe cash flow growth is really impressive and this is perhaps the most significant driver behind the rising share price. After some stagnation it is also set to continue growing as management expects strong cash flow in H2 this year.In H1, free cash flow ($165M) was dented by the increase in working capital in Q1 but management expects FY 2019 free cash flow to exceed $625M.Data by YChartsThe company has used its cash flow to deleverage to 1.8x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, below the midpoint of their 1.5x-2.5x range. From the earnings deck:One might be reminded of the prior progress (up until Q4 last year, so the deleveraging has stagnated in the last couple of quarters due to the acquisitions). From the Q4 earnings deck:But it is set to improve further. (Q2CC):The deleveraging has reduced interest payments quite a bit, although that has stagnated with the stagnation in the deleveraging process itself the last two quarters, but further reductions are likely:Data by YChartsThere has been mild dilution from incentive pay, but that is now set to moderate if not reverse by the introduction of a $1B share repurchase program, buying back a maximum of 2% of outstanding shares a year.Data by YChartsAnalysts expect the EPS to come in at $12.83 this year, rising to $14.01 in 2020.Even with growth slowing and growth stocks being out of favor, we think Zebra Technologies offers sufficient opportunities. The fact is that the kind of digitalization the company offers is a long-term tailwind that isn't much affected by economic conditions as it enables its customers to improve visibility and increase efficiency.We think the tailwinds are secular, the execution looks very good and the leverage and cash generation will keep earnings growing considerably faster than revenues. We see no valuation concerns, the stock is still attractive, in our view."
4310137,92986,2019-12-02T15:44:35-05:00,"Zebra Technologies has been one of my favorite stocks this year.The company had another record-breaking year as sales, margins, and earnings came in strong.The company maintains a strong outlook and has plans to avoid the pressure from List 4 tariffs.Needless to say, I continue to be a big bull and believe this stock has much more room to rise.","I have been looking forward to writing this article. I started covering Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) in June of this year giving it a 'very bullish' rating. After almost half a year has passed, I think it is fair to say the company has not disappointed. I am not (only) referring to the stock price return of almost 30% but the strong fundamental performance. The latest quarterly results confirm that the company is delivering everything we could have asked for. Sales, margins and earnings are way up and expectations are strong. In addition to that, I still do not consider this stock to be overpriced and expect further capital gains.Source: Zebra TechnologiesIt does not happen too often, but I finally get to review a stock that delivered good results across the board. In this case, Zebra Technologies reported adjusted third quarter EPS of $3.43. This is $0.14 above consensus expectations of $3.29 and $0.18 above guidance. It is also 19% higher compared to the prior-year quarter making this yet another quarter with double-digit EPS growth as the table below shows quite well. Without looking at any other indicators, it's fair to say this company is an 'earnings machine'.Source: EstimizeWith that said, I am very thankful the company made a beautiful slide in its presentation, highlighting the three numbers I care most about as you can see below: sales, margins and earnings. Total sales improved by 3.5% compared to the prior-year quarter to $1.13 billion. Excluding acquisition and currency changes, organic sales are up 3.0%. The AIT (asset identification and tracking) organic sales were up 3.5% thanks to strong printing, services, location solutions and retail solutions. This segment was closely followed by 2.7% organic growth in the EVM (enterprise visibility and Mobility) segment as a result of strong mobile computing and support services. In North America, the company managed to gain the most as organic sales were up 6%. North America was supported by strong sales from mobile computing, services and RFID related products. EMEA countries saw 2% higher organic growth while both APAC (-5%) and LatAm countries (-2%) were down. APAC sales were down solely based on macro weakness in China according to management.Source: Zebra Technologies Q3/2019 Earnings PresentationAdjusted gross profit was up 6.3% while adjusted gross margin ended the quarter at 47.7%. This is an improvement of 130 basis points from 46.4% in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin accelerated 160 basis points to 22.7%. Higher margins were achieved thanks to go-to market discipline, cost efficiencies, and a favorable business mix. These benefits were partially offset by a 20 basis points impact on gross margin from List 4 tariffs.And speaking of List 4 tariffs, this is by far one of the biggest problems regarding the ongoing trade war. This is a $100 million tariff problem if not addressed according to the company. The single biggest measure the company is taking is moving US volumes out of China by replacing production lines. This is not only interesting because it helps Zebra to avoid tariffs to a large extent, it is also interesting to see how many (tech) companies follow as this is a factor that could benefit the US in general.Source: Zebra Technologies Q3/2019 Earnings PresentationAnother point I want to mention is the fact that net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA has declined to 1.6x. This is at the lower end of the target range (1.5x - 2.5x) and a result of ongoing debt reduction. The company amended its credit agreement and was able to lower the cost of borrowing by roughly 25 basis points. Zebra also expanded its European accounts receivable factoring program, which is a factor supporting longer-term debt reduction.Source: Zebra Technologies Q3/2019 Earnings PresentationAt this point, debt levels are still slightly elevated, but the trend is going in the right direction. One should also note that elevated debt levels are not a problem as long as top line growth is strong and expected to be strong. The company also repurchased $20 million worth of shares in the third quarter under a $1 billion program announced on July 30.According to Zebra we should expect growth to continue. Fourth quarter net sales growth is expected to be between 4% and 6%. This is on top of 11% nominal growth in the prior-year quarter. This includes a 100 basis point impact from recent acquisitions and 100 basis point negative impact from foreign currency exchanges. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the $3.55 to $3.75 range. This includes an estimated negative net tariff impact between $0.08 and $0.15.Source: Zebra Technologies Q3/2019 Earnings PresentationAdding to that, the entire record-breaking performance of Zebra has occurred during an ISM manufacturing downtrend that has pushed the index below the neutral 50 level. Since the ISM index went below 52, the Zebra stock has gained roughly 30%. I can only imagine what happens once the global economy starts to gain momentum again. This could be sooner than later as we are witnessing first signs of a possible economic bottom.Source: TradingViewIt therefore does not bother me that the stock is trading at 17.8x next year's expected earnings. The company is growing at a fast pace and a cheap valuation would be a serious red flag in my opinion.This stock could see a minor pullback as it has gained roughly 30% since the first week of October. Regardless, I think this stock will break $300 on the longer term.Source: FINVIZStay tuned!Thank you very much for reading my article.

This is the first time I am covering Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), which is an Illinois-based producer of diversified machinery. The stock is among the top industrial performers this year and should be on every trader's watchlist as a buy during economic upswings. The company offers everything an investor or trader could ask for. A very innovative product portfolio, sky-high (organic) sales growth and rising margins. This company has been around since 1969 but has a ton of potential left in a rapidly changing business environment.Source: Zebra TechnologiesOver the past few months, I have increasingly focused on a list of what I consider to be the best stocks in every segment. I am looking not only at profitability but also at product portfolios and the ability to grow even when general economic growth is rather slow. Zebra Technologies is the perfect stock.Zebra Technologies is part of the diversified machinery segment. In this case, I think 'diversified' is one of the most appropriate ways to describe the company. Zebra products include mobile computers and scanners, barcode scanners and imagers, printers, RFID products, location technologies and much more.Source: Zebra TechnologiesSo not only does the company sell products that support more common operating activities but also solutions to enhance production in a time of 'internet of things.'Zebra Technologies offers a variety of products to streamline production thanks to smart software integration to speed up production. RFID design improves the speed, cost and probability of success of any RFID project. RFID means 'radio-frequency identification' and is used to automatically identify and tag objects. Additionally, the company offers workflow and design consulting to analyze existing infrastructure and technology as well as business processes which ends up with an intelligent solution to streamline business processes.Just recently, Zebra acquired Temptime, which will give Zebra exposure in the healthcare business. In this case, Temptime is a company that offers solutions like the ability to monitor the temperature of medical shipments.Source: Zebra Technologies Investor PresentationRoughly half of the company's sales are generated in North America with EMEA coming in second at slightly more than 1/3rd of total sales. The largest vertical markets are retail & e-commerce as well as manufacturing and transportation & logistics - in other words, the exact industries that are dependent on smart manufacturing and margin enhancements.Source: Zebra Technologies Investor PresentationWith everything said so far, let's discuss some key numbers. First of all, the most recent Q1 sales growth came in at 9.1%. That's a phenomenal number if you consider that organic growth came in at 7.9%. In other words, sales growth is not only acquisition-fueled but a result of rapidly rising organic demand. Especially, strength in healthcare and retail were pushing sales higher in Q1. EMEA sales were up 9% due to strength across data capture, printing and mobile computing.Adjusted EBITDA accelerated by 10.3% with adjusted EBITDA margins improving from 20.9% to 21.1% over the past 12 months.On a full-year basis, Zebra expects net sales to grow between 5% and 8%. This includes a 2 points impact from acquired businesses and a 50 basis point negative impact from FX. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to come in between 21% and 22%, which means that margins continue to be strong. This is good news given that the company is prone to tariffs on certain scanners, components and accessories produced in China. These impacts are mitigated through different supply sources, supply chain moves and price adjustments. And so far, the company is doing this quite successfully.Below you see why the company has been (and still is) so successful. Sales have accelerated to more than $4.3 billion on a TTM basis, with EBITDA margins recovering to almost 20%. As a result, operating income has soared to almost $660 million from roughly $190 million during the second half of 2016. Given that sales growth is expected to soar, I can only imagine what happens if the company continues to improve margins in an environment where tariffs are an increasing problem.With all of this being said, there's a problem that could be a blessing in disguise. As much as I love the company's innovative environment, it is still a company operating in a very cyclical environment. That's why organic sales growth declined to a mere 0.4% in 2016. This was a result of slowing economic sentiment in 2015 which impacted top-line growth in 2016. However, during the start of 2016, economic sentiment started to rise again, which resulted in organic sales growth of 6.5% in 2017 and 11.1% in 2018.The graph below shows what I am talking about. The orange line displays the ISM manufacturing index. This indicator tells us what we can expect in terms of hard economic growth over the next 3-6 months. Every time economic sentiment declines, Zebra either goes sideways or down until sentiment starts to rebound again. It worked a few years ago and I doubt it will fail this time.Extra: my entire economic outlook (detailed breakdown)Source: TradingViewZebra's stock is currently up 20% year-to-date and 18% below its all-time high. The stock is trading at 24x earnings and a forward P/E ratio of 14. The current ratio is at 1.00 with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.18 (source). Even though this is high, it does not indicate any danger as the company has a good liquidity position and is generating high organic growth with margins being in an uptrend.I put this stock on my watchlist as I think Zebra offers a lot of upside in the long term. The company offers top-tier products and services that will increasingly be needed in a changing industrial/retail environment. The company's strong (organic) sales growth numbers confirm this. In addition to that, we see that margins are rising despite the pressure from margins. This is expected to continue according to the company's guidance.Source: FINVIZThe only problem I see is falling economic sentiment. It is no surprise that the stock was unable to stay at its all-time high after a crazy rally in the first months of this year.I will put my money to work once I see signs of an economic bottom, even if that means that I could miss the 'perfect' bottom opportunity. This stock offers great long-term potential and deserves a lot more attention from traders and investors.Almost needless to say, I will continue to monitor this company going forward.Stay tuned!Thank you very much for reading my article.

4302084,21815,2019-11-04T04:39:12-05:00,"Despite moving most of its supply chains and sourcing out of China, a costly operation, the company produced good Q3 results.Zebra Technologies is well-positioned to benefit from increased digitalization of business and the increasing importance of software and AI solutions underpinning this.This shift and the company's cost discipline generate considerable leverage, with earnings and cash flow growing considerably faster than revenue.The shares need to digest recent steep gains but are still attractive.","In our last article about Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), we argued that the company benefits from a powerful tailwind with the increasing digitalization of business as a main driver, which is set to continue for years to come.What the company does is perhaps most succinctly summarized by the following quote from the Q3CC:Or even more succinctly, by the words Sense, Analyze, Act from the earnings deck:While we discussed growth drivers in previous articles on the company, there is one worth stressing here, which is the increasing importance of software, and most notable within that of machine learning and AI.This adds considerable sophistication from the barcode scanners, RFID tags and handheld computers hardware that are mainstays of the company. These are still viable - witness its recent largest ever contract win with USPS involving 300K TC77 mobile computers - but there is a subtle shift ongoing towards more software.And that is starting to win business for Zebra Technologies, like that big USPS contract (Q3CC, our emphasis):This is important also because software platforms usually generate increased margins and recurring revenues, and it allows the company to capture more of value from corporate efforts towards digitalization. Indeed (from the Q3CC):Some of the new solutions we can mention are:About Profitect (from the PR):And about Savanna (from the PR):The company introduced its Mobility DNA Suite in 2015. From the PR:And this software turns out to be an important driver for increased hardware sales as well (Q3CC):Digressing a bit, but the company's hardware still has a lot of mileage. The handheld computers are experiencing good quarters, and uptake is increased by:Zebra Technologies traditionally sourced most of its hardware from China, so the trade war and ensuing tariffs have been unwelcome news for the company requiring management to respond. This they did, which is summed up in a slide from the earnings deck:The impact is transitory, mostly due to moving supply chains out of China, but the company also has instituted a few price increases to recover tariff cost.The impact of moving supply chains out of China in Q1 will be considerable, roughly $20 million, 170-200bp of gross margin and a $0.25-0.30 EPS impact. Most of the impact will lessen in Q2 and be done by mid next year, with on aggregate the new supply chains producing similar cost levels with mostly the same suppliers.Zebra Technologies has also in-sourced some items like RFID tags and Temptime labels (providing exposure to temperatures).From the earnings deck:The results were a bit better than expected, with (non-GAAP) EPS beating by $0.15-3.43 and revenues missing by $10 million to $1.13 billion. Shares have already been on a tear:From the earnings deck:Data by YChartsThe move towards more software and cost-cutting is clearly paying off with upward trends in both gross and operating margins, despite the China sourcing problems caused by the trade war. Adjusted gross margin expanded 130bp to 47.7%.Data by YChartsHere is what leverage produces even if revenue grows in the single digits, a cash flow bonanza. The company still has substantial debts on its balance sheet though. From the earnings deck:Stock-based compensation is a fraction of revenue, and share buybacks are starting to bend the dilution curve:Data by YChartsData by YChartsAnalyst expect EPS of $13.01 this year rising to $14.09 the next, which gives the shares a forward earnings multiple of 17.While the direct China tariff risk is now well-known and taken care of (and will be out of sight by the middle of next year), the resulting slowdown of the world economy could still impact the company.There are a number of things to like in the shares. Zebra Technologies clearly benefits from the digitalization of business, and there is a slow shift from hardware toward software and AI to gain more analytical insights from supply chains and business processes.Zebra Technologies is adapting well to these trends, with its software solutions increasingly serving as differentiators for its hardware, enabling the company to provide total solutions attracting the biggest customers, like USPS.This shift is also creating leverage, both at the COGS as well as the operational level, enabling the company to grow profits and cash flow well beyond revenue growth. This has allowed it to deleverage and start share buybacks in a further virtuous cycle.While we don't see a whole lot of room for further valuation multiple expansion, we do see these favorable developments continuing for quite some time, perhaps a little slower in case of a further slowdown in the world economy. The shares remain attractive, in our view, although they need to digest the recent gains first."
4292468,73075,2019-09-19T09:45:47-04:00,"Zebra Technologies is the leading provider of workplace automation solutions in AIDC, Automatic ID and Capture technology.The company just reported blowout earnings, and I suspect guidance is overly cautious.Tight labor markets mean business and industry will turn to automation for productivity gains, and Zebra is where they will go.Undervalued relative to comparable peers, if Zebra initiated a dividend, it might see a substantial multiple expansion.Until then, investors can enjoy steady revenue growth and a new $1 billion share buyback program.","Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) is one of my two favorite stocks for playing today's labor market. Zebra Technologies is the leading supplier of AIDC technology for business and industry and poised to dominate a growing market. I say it is the leading provider because it is operating in a class of its own. There are other companies involved in automation, but none competes directly with Zebra, at least not on all levels.What exactly is AIDC technology? It is all those little connected Internet of Things devices that scan and track... anything and everything. The simplest are things like barcode scanners, the most advanced an ""Eye In The Sky"" that can identify objects within a warehouse, log their position, track them through the production/distribution process, and log it all into inventory.In between those two extremes, Zebra Technologies offers all manner of point-of-use technologies that can be linked to a central management point through IoT and Cloud technology. Basically, anything and everything any kind of business might need to capture data of any kind from any place and manage it across a network.Applications are not limited to inventory management in a warehouse environment. This technology can be adapted for any purpose, including kitchen operations (menu input equals burger cooked, prepared, and served) through industrial operations.The ultimate purpose of Zebra Technologies offerings is not to replace employees but to make them more productive. The FOMC highlights the need for such technology in the Beige Book, noting that businesses are leaning more and more on technology for just this purpose. The reason is simple, rising wages cut into profits; investing in automation can offset those costs with productivity gains.Source: own work, data from BLSThe simple take on labor market conditions is this: there are not enough Americans to fill all the available jobs. If a business wants to grow (or just fill needed positions), they will have to increase their wages and incentives and invest in automation.Regarding competitors, companies like Zendesk (ZEN), ABB Ltd. (ABB), Rockwell (ROK), Brooks Automation (BRKS), and Cognex (CGNX) all intersect with Zebra's business in some way, but none matches it. Zebra Technologies not only manufactures and distributes technology related to Automatic ID and Capture but also provides services, support, and supplies so businesses can maximize their use.Zendesk - Zendesk, Inc., a software development company, provides SaaS products for organizations. Its flagship product is Zendesk Support, a system for tracking, prioritizing, and solving customer support tickets across various channels. Basically, Zendesk is a potential takeover target for Zebra as it would complement the suite of services already offered. Zebra's offering and applications far surpass what you get from Zendesk.Rockwell Automation - Rockwell Automation, Inc. provides industrial automation and information solutions worldwide. It operates in two segments, Architecture & Software; and Control Products & Solutions. Rockwell may be the most comparable company to Zebra. It performs many of the same functions but is focused on manufacturing and industrial processes/management.ABB Ltd. - ABB Ltd. manufactures and sells electrification, industrial automation, and robotics and motion products for customers in utilities, industry and transport, and infrastructure worldwide. ABB Ltd. is another close comparison but more akin to Rockwell than Zebra Technologies and additionally focused on automating infrastructure and utility operations, not business and industry in general.Brooks Automation - Brooks Automation is another highly specialized automation services company, cryogenic services, so not much of a competitor.Cognex - Cognex Corporation provides machine vision products that capture and analyze visual information in order to automate tasks primarily in manufacturing processes worldwide. Cognex is directly competing against the product end, a small portion of it, but falls short in the bigger comparison. All they do is the vision capture devices and technology to operate them. Bottom line, Cognex is more a takeover target than a competitive threat.Second-quarter results were good, good enough to send shares up more than 15% when they were released. The company reported adjusted EPS of $3.02 beat by $0.13. This is a 22% gain over the previous year and driven by two things; revenue improvement and margin expansion.GAAP earnings of $2.26 are also better than expected and a substantial increase from the previous year. Revenue, a better indicator of growth, is up 7.9% YOY and driven by organic growth and acquisition. Margins expanded during the quarter by 100 basis points. The improvement is due to productivity gains and cost efficiencies that should carry through into coming quarters.Source: earnings call slidesThe company has some debt, but it is largely related to acquisition costs. Debt is further mitigated by equity and future revenue expectations. The company's debt to equity ratio is a tad high near 120%, but again, that is mitigated by expectations of future revenue. Free cash flow in the first half was $165 million, which proves liabilities are well-managed.Source: earnings call slidesFurther proof of balance sheet health is the new buyback program. The board authorized a new $1 billion buyback program that could wipe out 4.7 million shares or 8.7% of the shares outstanding. Considering the stock boasts 91% institutional ownership, there is a real chance for prices to be squeezed higher.Guidance for next quarter and the full year is OK, not great but OK. The 3rd quarter should see total revenue growth in the range of 3-5%, with 0-2% of that coming from organic sources. The full year is better, 5-8% growth with 3-5% organic, and then, next year growth should come close to low double-digits.One of the first things that jumped out at me when comparing Zebra Technologies with its competition is the valuations. Most of the stocks in this group are valued like a growth stock with P/Es far in excess of what the companies are realistically earning. Zendesk carries the highest multiple, nearly 116X forward earnings, and the average is near 48X forward earnings.Source: own work; data sourced from Seeking AlphaEven Rockwell, one of the more reasonably valued stocks, is trading above the broad market average. This is probably due to ROK's yield, which brings me to my point. Zebra is one of the fairest valued stocks on this list at only 15X forward earnings ... and it doesn't pay a dividend. Most other stocks on this list do pay a dividend. A situation that suggests to me Zebra could unlock significant shareholder value if it were to institute a dividend.Automation has been a trend in business for years, that is no secret. What is not so well known is that today's employer is turning to automation not to replace employees but to enhance their productivity. The labor market is so tight, there are not employees to fill available jobs, so employees are required to raise pay, and that is driving investment in automation. The kind of workplace automation offered by Zebra Technologies.Zebra Technologies is not alone in the realm of automation, far from it. What sets it apart is the scope of what it offers, the range of applications, and the services that back it all up. The only thing this stock doesn't have going for it is a dividend, and I really like a nice dividend.That said, the buyback program is nice and may spark a multiple expansion. If the buyback doesn't spark a rally, the balance sheet is healthy, and cash flow is there, so management could do a dividend if they wanted to. Zebra is a buy."

It will fund the purchase with a combination of cash and debt.A review of the firm’s most recent 10-Q filing indicates that as of March 30, 2019, Zebra had $61 million in cash and equivalents and $3.1 billion in total liabilities, of which $1.6 billion was long-term debt.Free cash flow for the three months ended March 30, 2019, was $27 million.In the past 12 months, ZBRA’s stock price has risen 13.62%, dropping significantly from its 52-week high, as the chart below indicates:Source: SentieoAll earnings surprises in the past 12 months have been positive, leading me to wonder if management is deliberately engineering positive surprises:Source: Seeking AlphaAnalyst sentiment in recent earnings calls has been stable after a drop in 2018:Source: SentieoZebra is acquiring Profitect to expand the range of its service offerings beyond just automatic data capture.As Zebra CEO Anders Gustafsson stated in the deal announcement:Integration risk should be minimal since the firms already had an existing relationship, albeit a strategic investment-based relationship.The deal makes strategic sense, even if it won’t move the stock price in the near term. The addition of Profitect’s machine learning and prescriptive analytic solutions to Zebra’s Savanna data platform should provide customers with a value-added solution set.The Profitect solution not only provides for sales growth but also improves supply chain inefficiencies, assortment discrepancies, with suggestions delivered to mobile devices for faster resolution.The deal is scheduled to close by June 30."
4223199,21815,2018-11-19T09:11:28-05:00,"The shares are at an all-time high but we think there is some more gas in the tank if the world economy doesn't slow down too much.We see further revenue upside, some operational leverage and large free cash flow as attractive features with a gradual shift to software as a longer-term lure.An escalation of the trade war would hurt though, so the cautious investor might prefer to wait for a little more clarity here.","We think that Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) has a little further to run on margin expansion and deleveraging and (further into the future) a gradual shift to a more software-dominated company. Escalating tariffs and/or a slowing world economy are some possible clouds on the horizon.Zebra Technologies has shown impressive growth which is reflected in the share price which has more than doubled in less than two years:We wonder though how much more investors can expect. First, the growth:ZBRA Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThe growth has indeed been impressive although the company spent a couple of years in the doldrums with respect to earnings as a result of the acquisition of Motorola Solutions in 2014.But as you can see, earnings have grown particularly fast the last 6-7 quarters after absorbing the earnings impact of the Motorola Solutions acquisition, so it's no wonder the share price is at an all-time high.The company offers ADC or automated data capture and workflow automation solutions that involve both hardware and software, as well as supplies. Management used the term intelligent automation, which they described as follows (Q3CC):From the earnings deck:SA contributor Thomas Hughes provides a good introduction for those interested in more detail.Workflow automation is dependent on deep knowledge of verticals, the ones in which the company specializes are manufacturing, healthcare, transportation and logistics as well as retail and e-commerce.We think the main growth drivers are:The first five are revenue growth avenues, the latter three give an earnings boost.The whole ADC market is getting a big boost from IoT, with autonomous sensors capturing and communicating data via wireless networks proliferating.One of the most important products for the company is the line of Android tablets and computers, as these are essential tools for its customers' field workers and for Zebra these are terminals containing their solutions.They're not a captive market though as Android is of course an open system, but nevertheless, selling these devices with solutions and the ability to extend these is an important market avenue for the company, like its Mobility DNA:There is a whole host of applications and management tools here. The company is benefiting from an ongoing shift away from Windows towards Android (Q3CC):Originally, there were about 15M of these legacy Windows devices so we're one third gone in this transition. The Android lifecycle is also shorter as innovation is moving at a faster pace, that is, we're already in the first replacement cycle from the company's first implementations way back in 2014.Another boost to this will come in 2021 when the US will switch off its 3G networks and older 3G devices have to be upgraded. Of course, their line up of Android devices got a big impulse with the acquisition this summer of Xplore, producer of rugged tablets and computers for $82M in cash.Since the company sells so many solutions, cross-selling is an important part of its market strategy, especially after the acquisition of the enterprise solutions business from Motorola.They enter sectors with a lead product (like wristband printers in healthcare), but with their burgeoning application space and the advent of Android, this can be leveraged into mobile computing (Q3CC):Mobile computers in retail were mostly used for productivity applications, but the company showed customers how these devices could be used for a host of other fields.The company is also innovating a lot, constantly introducing new solutions, for instance like SmartLens, from the company's website:SmartLens combines sensors, data analytics software and automates actions via a dashboard of settings and alerts with which retail outlets can automatically replenish orders back up the supply chain.Or SmartPack for loading operations:Software is another substantial growth area, although perhaps not immediately. Software is of course already a significant part of the company's revenues and much more of its competitive position as it delivers the intelligence to its hardware (as one might gather from the brief descriptions of solutions like SmartLens and SmartPack). From the 10-Q:Software still is a small part of sales and even looks to be growing more slowly but this is deceptive as it is lumped together with service. Management is thinking of selling more software on a SaaS basis independent from hardware in the future (Q3CC):We see a future where they could become mostly a cloud SaaS platform, which could garner a much higher valuation multiple, although this is future music still.From the earnings deck:During the Q3 CC, management argued that the free cash flow will exceed $600M and they also see upward potential for EBITDA margin.ZBRA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsThere has been a really substantial amount of operational leverage in the last four years, although the company isn't back to the levels of operational margin that it enjoyed before the Motorola Solutions acquisition.ZBRA Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThe company only really started to generate meaningful amounts of cash from the end of 2015 onwards, but there seems to be an acceleration going on. One of the reasons for this is the reduction of interest rate payments through deleveraging:That is quite an impressive debt reduction and with free cash flow hitting over $600M this year, leverage is hitting the bottom of their target range. An analyst asked whether cash flow will be used for buybacks as a result going forward.Management didn't rule that out, but made it clear that they prefer investing in the business, either organically and/or through acquisitions. Dilution has been pretty modest though, just over 6% in 5 years:ZBRA Shares Outstanding data by YChartsZBRA PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsAnalysts expect an EPS of $10.84 this year rising to $11.67 the next, which would give the shares a forward earnings multiple of 15.We see two main risks:The company's Q4 outlook assumes a modest impact from US tariffs on Chinese exports, as the company sources a considerable part of its production and parts from China. However, only a fraction of these are impacted by the tariffs so far, making the impact to date very modest.This could change when the 10% tariff automatically increases to 25% by the end of the year, and by a further implementation on the other half of US imports from China that aren't yet affected by tariffs.The company has formed a multi-disciplinary team to look at options, including alternative sourcing solutions, price hikes or even redesigning goods without parts with tariffs. So further escalation of the trade war will not go by unnoticed for the company.Despite the terrific run, we still think the shares are attractive. We see good revenue growth opportunities and we think their Android app cross-selling approach is quite compelling, as it offers customers a single pane of glass, a single device, with multiple solutions which are expanding in number.The value proposition becomes more powerful when these solutions start communicating with one another, offering valuable business analytics, or even completely automated solutions like inventory management, as in the case of SmartLens.This will also tend to lock users in, that is, increasing switching cost and hence the stickiness of its solutions, improving its competitive position.We think some further operational leverage will be possible and further deleveraging of the balance sheet is certainly possible as well, given the very substantial cash generation, otherwise they could restart share buybacks.Longer term, we see a more software-dominated company with the opportunity to expand valuation multiples."
4213022,73075,2018-10-21T21:03:21-04:00,"Growth stocks are falling out of favor as global growth estimates begin to fall.One segment is looking at robust growth despite the prospect of slowing global expansion and the impact of trade wars.Automation is sweeping the globe industry by industry, and is expected to produce significant growth over the next four decades.This stock is undervalued relative to its peers and in position to reap the rewards of expanding adoption of automation.","In my last article, I explored investment opportunities in the realm of automation. Automation is sweeping the globe industry by industry as businesses of all scope seek the benefits of streamlined operations. Automation is not limited to manufacturing or logistics although those are two of the fastest-growing segments. Automation is present in all aspects of our lives and is invading our homes, automobiles, healthcare facilities, workplaces, utilities, and government.When talking about automation you are really talking about the IoT, the Internet of Things, because it is connectivity that makes automation work. According to recent estimates from McKinsey & CO, IoT spending is expected to top $581 billion by 2020 with a compound annual growth rate near 10%. This spending is going to be focused in large part on devices and the software to operate them. No matter how you look at it, $581 billion is a whole lot of cabbage for IoT and automation technology companies to divvy up.The three sectors expected to spend the most money on IoT and automation infrastructure and service are discrete manufacturing, transportation & logistics, and utilities at $40 billion each. The next three biggest spenders are expected to be Business-to-consumer, healthcare, and process at more than $15 billion each with energy, government, and retail not far behind.The key takeaway is that spending will be on infrastructure and services; the IoT already exists, what businesses need now is the equipment and services to make it all work.Innovation and invention may be the driving force behind technological advances, but it is the practical application of those advances that turn ideas into businesses. A well-known example of this is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Edison; Tesla discovered most of what we know about electricity but it was Edison who turned the light-bulb into a consumer product industry worth billions of dollars.Zebra Technologies is a company cashing in on technological advancement, they didn't invent the IoT or automation but they are delivering the infrastructure and applications today's businesses need. Zebra Technologies has been working hard over the last few years to shift from an industrial services company to an industrial IoT services company and that transformation is complete.Zebra Technologies is now the leading supplier of IoT infrastructure technology to industry and focused on automated data capture or ADC. ADC is used to mean wands, registers, and readers to log and track inventory, shipments, and other industrial needs. Now IoT uses environmental scans to recognize items and automatically track their movement throughout a system.Zebra Technologies operates in several broad categories that span equipment, services, automation solutions, and supplies.On the products end, they manufacture, sell and service six lines of equipment that are designed to work together for a seamless connection of home-office and remote computing applications.On the services end, Zebra Technologies offers a wide array of service packages, certification courses and IoT automation solutions for six categories; healthcare, manufacturing, retail, government, transportation & logistics, and hospitality.Zebra Technologies also sells supplies, parts, and accessories needed to maintain and operate their equipment. Once Zebra Technologies lands a client they become, in most cases, a client for the life of their system.Zebra Technologies' success has been driven in part by the rapid adoption of IoT and automation among industrial and manufacturing firms. The industrial sector leads adoption rates at 45% of all businesses using some form of automation and is expected to increase another 20% over the next 12 months.Revenue growth has slowed in recent quarters but from a high 200% throughout 2015 to a near 10% in the last quarter. Based on the adoption rate and expected adoption rate of IoT by industry, I expect to see revenue continue to grow if not accelerate in the current quarter. Results at last look were driven by a substantial increase in YOY margins (+200% to 19.7%) that are expected to hold steady or improve in the current quarter.In addition to robust revenue growth, the company also reported aggressively paying down debt. Over the last year, Zebra Technologies has paid down debt and restructured its debt in a way that resulted in annualized interest expense savings of nearly $5 million. The deleveraging is good on two fronts as it reduces expenses and improves profitability, and also sets the company up to continue reinvesting in itself.The company also reported growing backlogs and strong free-cash-flow that led it to increase its guidance and there is no expectation that will change. The data of late (Leading Indicators, Philly Fed, Empire State) is strong and point to continued robust expansion of business activity into the end of the year. Notably, the Philly Fed MBOS reported a majority of businesses are planning CapEX increases next year.From the MBOSThe US expansion, coupled with high IoT adoption rates, and the expected exponential growth of the IoT (from 20 billion connected devices today to 50 billion connected devices by 2040) will drive revenue growth for this company long into the future.On a valuation basis, this stock is trading at only 14X forward earnings, a valuation I think is way too low, and well below the levels you'll find for other leading IoT/automation growth names. AeroVironment (AVAV), a maker of unmanned aircraft and missiles, is also a play on defense and trades at a whopping 65X forward earnings. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), a monster in the robotic healthcare field, is also richly valued at near 45X forward earnings. Cognex (CGNX), a maker of machine-sight technology, is more reasonably valued at only 30X forward earnings but still valued well above Zebra Technologies.Based on the P/E we could easily see Zebra Technologies double in value on a simple multiple expansion. Factor in growing revenue, widening margins, EPS growth, and the fact this company is the leader in its field, and it's possible this stock will triple over the next two to three years.There is competition in automation and it is fierce. The good news is that there are few direct comparisons to the scope and focus of Zebra Technologies. The closest two are Rockwell Automation (ROK) and Brooks Automation (BRKS) and they are both narrowly focused, and only Brooks has seen anything like the growth we're seeing with Zebra Technologies. Rockwell's focus is on industry, manufacturing and the machines those types of businesses need while Brooks is focused almost exclusively on Lifesciences and biotech. In both cases, businesses that utilize products from the competition may also need to call on Zebra Technologies for end-to-end connectivity.There is some risk for Zebra Technologies but the potential for rewards more than offsets them. The most notable is an economic slowdown. Some pundits see the chance economic growth will slow or recede within the next two years, but if it does, it won't be because business activity slows, it will be because labor markets are too tight. With a record 7.1 million jobs open and only 6.0 million unemployed workers available it is easy to see why. If all 6.0 million unemployed Americans got jobs tomorrow, there would be 1 million or nearly 15% of jobs left unfilled and that spells contraction for the businesses which can't find employees. The mitigating factor is that in this scenario the business activity that is driving success for Zebra Technologies will still be present, the need to update and automate will still be felt.My conclusion is simple. The build-out of the IoT is sweeping the globe and growing at a double-digit CAGR. This build-out is being led by manufacturing, transportation & logistics and utilities, but also aided by strength in most other segments of the economy. Zebra Technologies is a well-run company producing positive cash-flow, poised to grow with the rollout of the IoT, and trading at a deep discount to its peers which make it a definite buy in my book."
4202150,104662,2018-08-26T19:15:19-04:00,"Zebra Technologies has seen a 70% share price growth YTD.
        Despite their growth, they still have low valuation metrics relative to their expected revenue and earnings growth.
        Fears over their financial health still drag heavily on the stock despite increasing margins and earnings.
        Although new acquisitions can possibly elevate their debt levels again, Zebra's previous debt worries should no longer have such an impact on their valuation.
        Zebra Technologies should now be seen as a growth investment, and not a speculative investment anymore.","Companies that specialize in, or have widely embraced generating products for the Internet of Things (IoT) are often overvalued or carry too many valuation or financial risks. Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) was one of these companies over the last few years. Their transition from industrial technology supplier to industrial IoT supplier was not particularly smooth, but I believe that their financial health has finally increased to the point where Zebra Technologies has transitioned from a speculative investment to a growth investment. Although investors have seen great returns of around 70% year to date, I believe Zebra Technologies still has room to grow, and their aggressive financial strategies to provide a better balance sheet over the last 3 years have not yet been priced in.Source: Morningstar (link here)Zebra Technologies serves as an ADC supplier. ADC stands for Automatic Data Capture, and about a decade ago, this mainly meant scanners, bar code printers, and RFID. But Zebra recognized the potential of IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) and performed a business model expansion. Through acquisitions, very high levels of debt, and several quarters with negative earnings, Zebra has arguably completed their business model transition.Source: Morningstar (link here)And throughout their business model re-positioning and acquisitions, they have added to their portfolio of ADC solutions, and have become the market leader in ADC, with Honeywell (HON) a distant second in this particular industry.Source: Modern Materials Handling (2017 Study Here)Similar to most third party reports, such as the one above, investors need to perform their own analysis. Although Zebra appears to be in first by a wide margin, this report combines Zebra’s two revenue sources, AIT (Asset Intelligence and Tracking) and EVM (Enterprise Visibility and Mobility). Although these two go hand in hand, it makes comparing firms rather difficult, as there are several products in Zebra's portfolio that are outside of the ones listed. Regardless, Zebra Technologies has a wide portfolio that allows firms to add the potential of IoT to their enterprises. Most of their IoT offerings have been added within the last few years, during their business model redesign, including computer hardware, wearables and software services.Source: Zebra IR (link here)The addition of these tech offerings and their corresponding data integration ecosystem creation was not an easy process, which contributed to the high volatility Zebra Technologies has experienced throughout the last few years. However, with the damage of their major acquisitions no longer dragging on their balance sheet, Zebra is arguably in the best financial health since 2014.Source: Zebra IR (presentation here)Zebra has been very aggressive in paying off their high debt levels from their acquisitions. This has lead to a decrease in debt from $3.25 billion to $2.01 billion. Their current equity to debt ratios are biased due to their recent acquisition and debt payoffs. However, despite having very low levels of cash on hand ($46 million), Zebra raised their YTD cash flow by $52 million YoY to $233 million. Their cash flow has lead to a 14.37 P/CF ratio, which generates a more reasonable evaluation of Zebra compared to their current cash balances.This recent quarter also marked the third straight quarter of positive earnings for Zebra, with guidance projecting an EPS between $2.50 and $2.70 for next quarter, which would represent a massive increase from their EPS from 2017 Q3, which was $-0.23.Although Zebra still has a ways to go on the financial health standpoint, I no longer see this as a major risk, as Zebra is now presenting similar metrics as other high growth companies. An operating margin of 13.69% and a ROE of 18.14% indicate Zebra has neared the end of their business model redesign.The main argument I’m presenting is that Zebra growth isn’t completely priced in to their valuation, which is likely due to their balance sheet, which I believe is no longer a large enough risk to cause such an effect on their price. Below, I lay out the major valuation metrics for Zebra.Source: Yahoo Finance and Seeking Alpha, Gather by AuthorDespite revenue growth projected to be above 10% for the rest of the year, and continued increases in earnings, there is no indicators of their growth fully priced into their valuation. Their P/E ratio is currently high, but this is based on the last 12 months, which includes one quarter below earnings, and another barely above 0. This leads to the large discrepancy between their P/E and their forward P/E.If we were to perform a P/E calculation between their last two quarters ($2.019 for Q1, $1.29 for Q2), and guidance for next quarter ($2.60 as the midpoint), this would lead to the P/E to drop to 28.6, and that is only for three quarters of earnings. If we add a conservative estimate of $2.00 EPS for Q4, we now see the P/E drop to 21.4. With top line growth in the double digits, this provides an excellent investment case for investors.Besides Zebra believing that there is still plenty of room to grow their data ecosystem offering, Zebra has also been posting these numbers in several geographies and industries that are currently facing short term stress. Manufacturing and industrials make up a large portion of Zebra’s portfolio, as well as companies outside of America. Due to trade war concerns and rising costs in industrials over the last several months, it is likely that many of Zebra’s potential customers have been focusing on reducing costs, and putting off technological purchases until the trade war and costs die down. This provides an even greater long-term growth driver for investors, as a rebound in manufacturing will likely benefit Zebra Technologies as well.Source: Zebra IR (presentation here)Of course, it would be unfair to only post this without explaining why I believe the market has Zebra at low valuation levels. As mentioned before, Zebra is in great financial health relative to the last few years, but overall, they are currently holding on to large amounts of debt, and very little amounts of cash. However, I believe their high levels of cash flow mitigate this risk somewhat.Also, in my valuation analysis, I proclaim that it is very possible for Zebra to be trading at a P/E of 21.4 for their 2018 numbers. A slowdown in global manufacturing, or cost pressures, may cause Zebra to lose possible sales as manufacturing firms look to delay technological investments. Also, as several industrial stocks have been seeing their share prices decline, this may lead to a decline in Zebra’s shares as well.Zebra is also open about the fact that they believe that M&A will be an excellent source of growth. In the last earnings call, CEO Anders Gustafsson said, “Well, we now been – spent last three years aggressively paying down debt and that's giving us a lot of financial flexibility. So, we're now, as we said in our prepared remarks, at the high-end of our targeted net-debt-to-EBITDA range of 2 times to 2.5 times. We are seeing number of good opportunities for us to invest in our business both organically and inorganically. And these opportunities would deliver attractive ROI for our shareholders. I think Xplore is a great example of this. It's the first acquisition we made since 2014. So, it's basically four years.”Although Zebra has an excellent history of creating value through acquisitions, the fact that they are alluding to the possibility of more acquisitions will make investors nervous. The expected high levels of debt needed for these acquisitions will cause financial stress and increase the risks associated with Zebra, as well as lower their expected EPS, as was the case the last 3 years.Also, Zebra is expanding to provide a data ecosystem that will rely heavily on analytics, AI, and data infrastructure. This presents a risk as there are several larger companies that also specialize in these areas, and may decide to enter into the IIoT space. However, companies that have been active in IoT such as Amazon (AMZN) are currently customers of Zebra, which should provide slight relief of a tech giant attempting to take market share from Zebra. Also, Zebra specializing in the actual IoT hardware will give them downside protection, as companies may elect to use Zebra’s products, yet store or analyze the data through another vendor.Source: Zebra (presentation here)Zebra has taken several years to establish financial health during their business remodeling. With lower levels of debt and increasing operating and cash flow margins, the risks of their financial health should become less of a concern for investors. However, these concerns are still heavily priced in, and Zebra is currently providing very low valuation metrics despite top and bottom line growth.However, investors should realize that these fears may become realized if Zebra decides to use their lower levels of debt to perform more acquisitions. Although Zebra has an excellent history of generating value from these acquisitions, high levels of debt will again increase the risk of investing in Zebra.Although still risky, I believe Zebra Technologies has transformed from a speculative investment to a growth investment, and investors should start considering Zebra Technologies as an investment in the IIoT and I0T sectors. With fears of the trade war’s effect on manufacturing and the high levels of debt causing Zebra to produce low valuation metrics, I believe Zebra should continue their run as they continue to lower their debt and increase their margins. Despite a 70% increase YTD, I believe Zebra is still not overvalued, and could present a growth investment for investors.Disclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

3975321,76785,2016-05-16T10:48:19-04:00,"Zebra was a story stock, and that story has been battered heavily after reporting Q1 2016 results.Revenue continues to slowly miss expectations, and lowered 2016 guidance on poor margins weighed on the company.Zebra Technologies was always a high risk/reward play; either the Motorola acquisition worked out or it didn't. Things have begun to start leaning towards ""not working.""","Zebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) is a play I've traded in and out of in the past, but I, along with Wall Street it seems, have finally thrown the towel in frustration when it comes to the long thesis. It is not too often I participate in earnings announcements selloffs, but I was guilty of selling into what became a 16% drop that accompanied weak results for Q1.What drew me to Zebra Technologies in the first place was the story. The long thesis around Zebra settled around a theme of consolidation and disruption - some of my favorite things. The large acquisition of Motorola Solutions' Enterprise unit (for the hefty price tag of $3.45B) would create a power player perfectly positioned to disrupt the professional mobile devices and analytics market, addressing business needs of retail, healthcare, and manufacturing companies. Cutting through the jargon for those unfamiliar with Zebra - what does Zebra Technologies make exactly? I'm sure you've seen your friendly neighborhood retail employee holding one of these little gizmos - a key Zebra product. While some businesses have opted to use smartphone or tablet-like devices, the sturdy construction, along with a reasonable price tag, make Zebra products like the above better suited for a workplace environment where things ""happen."" Hell, even if the store is getting robbed, an employee can use one of these as a blunt weapon to defend the storefront. Even after putting the criminal into a coma, it is likely that this device will still work just as well afterwards.Jokes aside, technology such as this that improve logistics and management within businesses has become extremely important. Need to know if an item is in stock to inform a customer? Better yet, where it is located in the back? Maybe communicate with a co-worker over WiFi for them to go fetch it for you? Devices like these solve all those problems in one tidy little package.The Motorola acquisition was a gutsy move, one that doubled the size of Zebra Technologies overnight (while also more than doubling its leverage). Zebra management assuaged investor concerns, stating that Motorola's current customer network, patent portfolio, and product line-up (that includes the sledgehammer-like mobile device pictured above) would provide a new opportunity to cross-sell legacy Zebra products (enterprise printing, asset tracking, barcoding), further bolstering the old business. Beyond that, Zebra management believed that, with its experience, it could manage this Enterprise business better than Motorola could. Over time, margins would improve, significant cash flows would be generated to pay down the debt, and the end result would be an extremely attractive business with significant size and scale in an otherwise fragmented, though highly competitive, market.Given acquisition and integration costs involved, this was one of the rare times I've accepted the reasoning behind non-GAAP earnings reports. At first blush, things were going well; Q1 2015 was excellent. Fears related to what revenues the Motorola assets would generate appeared unfounded, and the company performed well on non-GAAP and GAAP measures compared to both my and Wall Street expectations. Over the year, however, results started to slip, I began to get impatient, and the final culmination became what turned out to be a disastrous start to 2016.Q1 2016 - No Growth, Some Missing StrengthAdjusted sales were down 3% in constant currency, with weaker results out of Enterprise than in the Legacy business. North America was down 7% y/y; worse than expected after the roaring start that investors benefited from in the beginning of 2015. Management cited a range of factors to blame for this weakness, from economic uncertainty, to buyers pushing sales out to future quarters, distributor destocking, and difficult y/y comparisons. However, despite citing reasons which should be temporary in nature (i.e., buyers deferring sales from Q1 to Q2 or Q3), Zebra management still lowered outlooks for both the second quarter and the full fiscal year. That tells me that the picture here may not be as rosy as it seems and may not simply come down to timing issues, despite management assurances to the contrary. Under-promising only to over-deliver is not something we've seen Zebra management typically do in the past.Restructuring and other unusual expenses remain high, but in line with my own expectations. The company bore $174M in restructuring and integration costs in 2015, with $120M expected in 2016. This spending is being done primarily to improve and consolidate the IT platforms and ecosystems, along with some the usual cost efficiency improvements driven by reducing redundancies and improving scalability that comes with merging two independent businesses into one entity. According to management, this spending should taper down to more reasonable levels in 2017. Overall, these costs have not been wholly out-of-line.Margins at the operating level, however, have been fairly poor. Q1 saw 0% operating margin from a GAAP perspective; 5.4% excluding restructuring charges. According to management, wholly all of operating expense synergies ($120M out of $140M expected) were already realized by the end of 2015. Other than the potential of squeezing out a little bit more margin on the cost of goods side, this is as good as it is going to get other than some marginal cost of goods gains and FX-driven improvements. There are plenty of companies that function just fine on single digit operating margins, but most aren't dealing with the debt load that Zebra has.18-20% EBITDA target has been the goal, and as the CFO pointed out on the conference call, they would have achieved the high end of that range if we still had the EUR/USD exchange at 1.33, as was the case when the Motorola acquisition was committed to. While that might be true, It's a long, long road back to 1.33 EUR/USD from 1.13, and the continued divergence on monetary policy, with European policy-makers weakening as the United State slowly starts to wean itself off of its low interest rate policy, don't really point towards a rapid depreciation of the USD compared to our peers overseas. SG&A/revenue of 23% is sky high, and that excludes acquisition/integration costs.ConclusionFor me, as a company that is posting GAAP losses, I need assurance the non-GAAP story is progressing properly, and there is light at the end of the tunnel. That means revenue and earnings growth that meets my expectations. After four straight quarters of revenue misses, the story here has some significant cracks forming. The sharp drawdown is justified, and the lack of deal-chasers that often accompany stocks that fall sharply after earnings show just how impaired the results appear to be at a glance. While the company will continue to post substantial free cash flow for the next several years due to prior accumulation of depreciation/amortization ($300M tailwind to 2016/2017 cash flow annually), that won't remain the case in the long term if current 2016 guidance for capital expenditures is the new norm ($70M). I don't believe the business is broken - far from it - but the runway to significant growth and profitability isn't as visible as it once was.For more research like this on companies perpetually underfollowed by Wall Street, consider following me (via the ""Follow"" button at the top of this article next to my name) to receive notification when I publish research.

4256570,21815,2019-04-25T04:57:11-04:00,"The company is powered ahead by some favorable long-term trend, as its clients require more operational visibility.The booming sales powers margin expansion and boosts cash flow, which is invested in R&D and acquisitions, reinforcing its position.There is another pay-off, which is a strong reduction in leverage, and we think this will be followed by substantial share buybacks pretty soon.There are risks like a slowing economy and/or a market correction.","Half a year ago, we told you that Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) was still a buy, despite its stock hitting an all-time high. Well, despite a little wobble with the market in December, the stock has indeed rocked higher and continues to set new all-time highs:We think this can continue for some time, with the proviso that it's also likely to depend on the general market conditions. Why? Well, simply because the business is booming and continues to boom, the company keeps on improving through introducing new products and smart acquisitions, and the cash flow keeps on growing.The company offers ADC, or automated data capture, and workflow automation solutions that involve both hardware and software, as well as supplies. Management used the term intelligent automation, which they described as follows (from the Q3CC):This aids the company's customers in their digitalization of processes and helps them become more efficient. We agree with management that this is a trend that is increasing in importance (from the Q4CC):Zebra Technologies keeps on adding solutions, both developed internally as well as from acquired companies, leading management to argue (from the Q4CC):We can't independently verify whether it is indeed gaining market share, but it's obviously doing something right. Handheld computers is one area of growth for the company (from the Q4CC):And there are still some 10 million legacy computers waiting to be replaced by new Android devices (and the company is still selling Windows devices as well). The company has increased its R&D spending:Data by YChartsManagement argues that this is clearly working (from the Q4CC):Acquisitions is another way for the company to grow. Last year we saw the acquisition of Xplore, the producer of rugged tablets, for $6 per share in cash. This year, Zebra Technologies intends to acquire Temptime, a privately held developer and manufacturer of temperature monitoring solutions for mission-critical applications in the healthcare industry.Growth in all four of its main verticals is driven by the same trends (from the earnings deck):And these trends are shifting from large companies to smaller ones (from the Q4CC):Smaller companies aren't the only fertile new ground for Zebra Technologies - there are also adjacent markets.From the earnings deck:While its healthcare vertical was growing particularly fast, the company experienced double-digit growth in all four of its main verticals.From the earnings deck:There are some mild currency headwinds expected in 2019, but overall, the company argues it has a healthy backlog and pipeline, more diversified compared to a year ago.Data by YChartsMargins (even the GAAP versions depicted above) are trending upwards, there is clearly leverage, both on the gross as well as the operating level. Zebra Technologies has been able to increase gross margin by over 100bp in both its segments, and management suggests this could be a trend (from the Q4CC):Price and mix also play a role here, and the latter could be a bit more variable, although management argues that they have the capability to add new, more sophisticated products commanding higher margins.However, there is one element in the product mix that is favorable for margins (from the Q4CC):Software tends to produce much higher gross margins, so this is a favorable trend. The company's Savannah cloud platform comes to mind (from the earnings deck):Data by YChartsThis enormous improvement basically makes life a lot easier for the company, as it can reduce debt (from the earnings deck):Zebra Technologies paid back $657 million in debt last year, bringing back leverage to just 1.8x. This, of course, also reduces interest payments:Data by YChartsAnd pretty soon the cash flow could be used to start buying back shares instead of debt, reducing the share count, which has been increasing moderately in the last five years due to incentive pay:Data by YChartsIndeed, the company reduced its leverage target to 1.5x-2.5x and argued (from the Q4CC):That bottom of 1.5x leverage is already in sight. In any case, Zebra Technologies had a very impressive 2018 from a balance sheet perspective:We think that the asset automation and digitalization is a trend that is set to continue for quite some time, and the company seems pretty well-placed to benefit from this trend. However, that doesn't mean there are no risks.One risk is a slowdown in the economy, which could spill into a recession. Asset automation should not be particularly sensitive to that, as it allows companies to become more efficient and reduce cost, but nevertheless, spending will be affected.The other risk could be the occasional quarterly disappointment. When shares have continued to do as well as the shares of Zebra, the risk of that increases as the bar is set higher and the comps tend to become more difficult. To illustrate, the company has a history of considerable positive surprises (from SA):And positive surprises might get baked into expectations, which would set the bar ever higher.We are actually inclined to say that if and when that happens, it could offer a buying opportunity, unless that quarter produces information that the trend has turned less favorable than is warranted by the valuation.The last risk is a general market correction. Zebra won't be able to escape that.Data by YChartsThe shares aren't cheap anymore, which isn't surprising, of course, especially in this market. Analysts expect EPS this year of $12.47, rising to $13.42 next year, which give the shares an earnings multiple of 18.Zebra Technologies has a booming business which produces operational leverage and exploding free cash flow. The latter, especially, is a reason to remain bullish on the shares, as the company could pay off its entire debt within two years. This would not only be by freeing itself from the $90 million of interest payments, but also turning to share buybacks, accelerating EPS growth.It's always a little risky to buy shares when they have had a terrific tun already, compounded by the market run. But unless one fears the bad quarter is the one they're going to report soon or fears an imminent market correction, we think shares in Zebra Technologies are still a good buy.A usual strategy would be to go in with half a position. One can always add should there be some downdraft in the shares."
3986911,80105,2016-07-07T11:31:04-04:00,Technology industry can't do without.Values can be found that are not traps.Sales growth but markets misprice.,"Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA)What is black and white and read all over? That riddle rings from my childhood and the answer then was mysteriously, 'a newspaper'. Of course I have just dated myself before the advent of color.I mused over this unrelentingly because I really didn't read a newspaper until I was a teenager. Today, the riddle is equally apropos, only the answer has changed. Today, every package has a ZEBRA marking. Indeed, all are black & white and read all over. Every package has one. Every checkout counter has one.Digging in, ZBRA makes direct thermal label printers and radio frequency identification (RFID) encoders for all industry including; retail, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, and healthcare. It's moved beyond the physical realm and provides real-time locating solutions for supply chains to warehouses and delivers a host of inventory information in database and mobile app services. ZBRA is completely integrated by offering scanners, barcode labeling, and personal identification. It supplies all of the hardware, related accessories, consumables (self-adhesive labels), and software. If it has a bar code, chances are ZBRA made it; and its software is tracking it too.Exploring its equity, ZBRA is trading at prices not seen since 2013, and at the 52 week low. CEO Anders Gustafsson explained in May the following, "" Given our first quarter results, continued macro uncertainty, and cautious spending behavior from many of our North America, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and Latin American customers, we are introducing a tempered outlook for the second quarter and have reduced our full-year sales outlook.""Clearly, that revision was not well received. Revenue in the three months ended in March dropped 5%, year over year, to $847 million and EPS fell to $1.01. This missed expectations of $879 million and EPS of $1.22. Forecasts were revised lower for the quarter (Q2). Revenue will now range from $867 million to $894 million and EPS of $1 to $1.20. These too are below past estimates for $906 million and EPS $1.30. Overall, the revenue outlook for 2016 is revised down to $3.56 billion to $3.7 billion, below consensus for $3.72 billion. This trims up to $160 million off the top lineMarkets Overreact: Have the wheels fallen off? You'd think so given the look over your shoulder. 12 months ago ZBRA was trading at $117. Today's close was $46. Elevators don't fall that fast! Perhaps a poacher shot and killed the last one! But maybe not… ValueLine still gives ZBRA its A rating.VL acknowledges the debt induced acquisition of Motorola's Solutions' Enterprise business. A refresher is available here. And debt has the attention of management. The CFO just repriced $2 Billion of its debt outstanding to Libor +3.25%, a savings of .75% or $14 million per year. This savings goes directly to the bottom line. Free cash flow is being used to aggressively reduce debt, $300 million this year and another $300 million next year too. That execution delivers this ZBRA the 'A' rating.Under the Hood:Analysts have ZBRA's EPS pegged to $5.25 this year and $6.20 next. A back of the napkin price target (EPS x average multiple) takes us to $73.50 in 2016 and $87.50 in a year. But wait, the current market has this ZBRA priced for dead. Did anyone ever see the market overreact?There's lots of good reading on ZBRA solving problems in today's competitive industry. Simply, industry cannot do without ZBRA's productivity gains. Today's news is good reading. Barron's offered some really cool applications in a recent interview here.The Trade and How to Express your Opinion:ZBRA isn't going to pay a dividend soon. This is perfect medicine for the drug induced search for yield from anywhere. I don't have to pile on to the interest rate experiment around the world, but I will chastise any investor who buys or holds an equity for the yield. I don't want to get off base but there are very few instances where equity should replace income securities. And this is a nice set up for an options play.Looking 6 months out, Volatility is running meaningfully higher. Writing (selling) options makes sense here. On the board are February 2017 series that captures the volatility advantage and pays us handsomely for time. The $45 Put had a wide bid / ask, but I think you'll get filled at the mark $5.40. You'll receive $540 immediately for each contract. You could write the November series and collect about $430. You leave $110 on the table as your maximum potential for the sale is lower. My preference is the richer premium now (and lower cost basis if I take the assignment; Premium received - Strike price), because in November ZBRA may be on its way to the target and you won't want to re-write another option then.Or, and I like this equally as well, just buy ZBRA. At $46+- and nearer term target over $70, gives us ~37% to the upside.Disclosure: Long ZBRA (basis under $50), Intend to short ZBRA put options.

3204286,78265,2015-05-22T18:16:14-04:00,"There are a host of reasons to avoid Zebra Technologies. Chief among these is the fact that returns on capital are lower than costs of capital.In addition, the shares are priced for perfection and that's never a recipe for success.Finally, goodwill and added debt make the capital structure look particularly fragile. Avoid Zebra Technologies.","We recommend investors avoid Zebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) for a host of reasons. Chief among these is the disconnect between the cost of capital at the firm and the returns the firm makes on that capital. In addition, there's a great deal of risk in the capital structure, primarily related to goodwill (asset side) and increased long-term debt (liability side). We believe there's little hope that margins will improve dramatically, which causes us to question current valuation. Finally, the shares are very optimistically priced and when they've been priced this way in the past, investors have eventually been disappointed.Return on Capital Vs. Weighted Average Cost of CapitalThe capital a business needs to fund its operations costs money. If the returns the company makes on that capital is less than its costs, economic loss is the inevitable result. In this section, we'll go through our analysis of the comparison between what Zebra pays for capital and what it makes on capital.What It Makes on CapitalThe formula we'll use to determine what the company makes on its capital is to look at the net operating profit net of the tax shield and compare that to the size of the capital base, made up of both debt and equity. In order to complete this calculation, we'll need tax rates. The company's effective tax rate was a very atypical 94% in 2014 (!), so we'll disregard it. We'll instead average the rates for 2012 and 2013. This comes to an effective tax rate of 22%.Specifically, the formula for return on capital is:(Operating Income * (1-tax rate)) / Average Invested Capital (from Q1 2014 and Q1 2015)Average invested capital = Book Value of Long term debt + Book Value of Short term debt + Book Value of Equity less any cash on the balance sheet.Net operating profit for the last four quarters was $55 million. Tax rate is 22% and therefore the operating income minus the tax shield is: $55,000,000 (1-.22) =$42,900,000. That's the numerator ""return"" portion of ""return on invested capital."" Now let's check out the ""invested capital"" portion denominator.Whenever we compare income statement figures (that flow through time) with balance sheet figures (a picture at a particular point in time), we need to average the balance sheet figures. Therefore, when deriving the invested capital, we'll get the mean of the balance sheet numbers for March 2015 and for March 2014. In both cases, we don't consider cash to be part of the invested capital, so we strip it out.March 2015LT Debt: $ 3.144 billion + ST Debt: 0 + Book Value of Equity: $1.026 billion - cash $.033 billion= $4.137 billion invested capital as of March 2015.March 2014LT Debt: 0 + ST Debt: 0 + Book Value of Equity: $ 1.009 billion - cash $.051 billion=$.958 billion invested capital as of March 2014Average: ($4.137 + $.958)/2=$2.55 billionThe Return on Invested Capital is $42,900,000/$2.55 billion which works out to ~1.7%. Over the past year, this company has earned about 1.7% on the capital that it has invested. This is not adequate in our view, in light of the risk here. Further, we believe we're giving the company a ""break"" by averaging the current highly levered period with a period where debt was zero. Investors buy a future and as time progresses the denominator will balloon as the full impact of this new leverage starts to weigh on the balance sheet.The next question we need to work out is - what's the cost of that capital? If it's higher than 1.7%, that's problematic.Weighted Average Cost of CapitalBecause the cost of capital is a weight of the ratio for both equity and debt, we need to first work out what the values for equity and debt are and then work out the weights of each of these elements to give us the basis for a weighted average cost of capital.We'll use the market capitalization as a surrogate for the cost of equity. At the moment, market capitalization for Zebra Technologies is $5.6 billion.The market value of debt is more difficult to calculate, so we'll use the most recent book value as a proxy. We'll use the figures we calculated in the return on invested capital step. Therefore, the book value of debt for our purposes is $3.144 billion.The next step is to work out the weights of each of these two types of capital.Weight of equity = 5.6/(5.6+3.144) = 64%Weight of debt = 3.144/(5.6+3.144)= 36%Now that we have our weightings, the next step is to work out the cost of the company's (massive) debt. To do this we'll use the annualized interest expense from the company's income statement to work out the cost of debt. Because the debt has just ballooned, we'll take the interest expense from the most recent quarter and double it ($50.9 * 2= $101.8 million). So, cost of debt is 101.8/3144= 3.25%.Cost of EquityIn order to calculate the cost of equity, we'll use the (admittedly flawed) capital asset pricing model (CAPM) beloved by business students and CFA candidates everywhere. The formula for CAPM is:Risk free rate + Beta of asset * (Expected return of the market - risk free rate).We've calculated Beta for Zebra as 1.04. You can learn about our approach here (we took the price for both Zebra and the SP500 back to January 1, 2009). We use the 10-year risk free rate of 2.25% and we require a market return of 8%. Throwing that all together equals a cost of equity of 8.23%.The next step involves calculating the (approximate) total weighted average cost of capital. It is (8.23% * .64) + (3.25% *.36) = 6.44%.When a company's weighted average cost of capital is ~6.5% and its return on that capital is ~1.7% (probably heading lower because of the impact of leverage), that's a bad sign. As the company adds capital it begins to suffer economic loss.We'll be the first to admit that there are problems with comparing return on capital to the cost of capital. You can't easily determine the market price for debt, since the capital structure has just ""risked up,"" balance sheet averages must be treated with some skepticism. There also are a host of problems associated with the CAPM. Those criticisms of this approach are all reasonable. The thing is, though, it does help people begin to think about the fact that there is a cost to capital. That cost may not be precisely 6.4%, but it is certainly higher than the current returns on capital. When costs are greater than returns, economic loss is the inevitable result. For those still not convinced, a company with higher costs of capital and lower returns on capital will display a disconnect between revenue and net income. We see that in the case of Zebra over time, where the two seem uncoupled to us.Source: GurufocusBut Wait, There's MoreIf the relationship between the cost of capital and the returns on that capital was the only problem here, that would be a point of concern, but it may not convince us to avoid this name. There are other problems with it, though. First, the most recent operating margin is 2.6% and net margin was, of course, negative after the impact of the interest expense.The balance sheet also is troubling to us. For instance, not all intangible assets are created equal. Some actually meet the accounting definition of an asset because they represent future economic benefits for the company. Others are less likely to result in economic benefit because they represent the difference between the price paid for an acquisition and the market value of the assets acquired (i.e. ""goodwill"" in this case could arguably = overpayment). It may not be an overpayment, but it's hard to deny the increased debt and the large amount of goodwill makes the capital structure much more risky than it was 12 months ago. Goodwill represents 45.5% of assets and long-term debt represents 57% of the entire capital structure of the firm.Optimistic ForecastThe company reported a loss of $.50 per diluted share in the most recent quarter. Additionally, the forward PE for the company is apparently about 15. Holding price constant, that suggests the market is forecasting annual earnings next year for this company in the neighborhood of $7.40. We would consider that to be exceedingly optimistic. When optimistically priced shares inevitably disappoint, shares typically get crushed.ConclusionWe believe investors who own this name would be wise to sell at these prices. Last year's purchase (thoroughly described here) may create value, but we're skeptical. Acquisitions have a history of disappointing. Also, the shares are priced for a perfection we don't believe they can achieve given the low margin, high debt loads and disconnect between the cost of capital and the return on that capital. In case you missed our earlier advice: Avoid Zebra."
3466306,22775,2015-08-25T18:42:48-04:00,"Zebra’s top-line is healthier than ever as Motorola Enterprise is back on track.True, current profitability is below expectations but margin pressures are likely to dissipate by FY16.Zebra also is deleveraging fast its balance sheet.The stock’s valuation is cheap when compared to its earnings growth profile.","Zebra (NASDAQ:ZBRA) is now down ~35% since its June peak. While the stock had been pretty resilient to initial market jitters, the Q2 EPS shortfall and light Q3 guidance took investors by surprise and sparked a 20% selloff on the earnings report day.Investors' disappointment is understandable and we would add that the stock needed to take a breathing following its huge run since early 2014. That being said, we view the recent pullback as overdone as we consider that several positives emerged from the Q2 earnings report.First, the sales performance impressed for the second quarter in a row as the legacy business continued to accelerate (+17% at constant FX vs. +15% in Q1 and +11% in Q4) while Motorola Enterprise confirmed the sharp improvement seen in Q1 (+9% at constant FX vs. +6% in Q1 and flattish or declining revenues in previous quarters). Investors have long been wary about Zebra's ability to revive the Motorola business and this robust revenue growth suggests that the cross-selling efforts and recent product development investments are paying off, giving confidence in the new Zebra outlook.Second, the consensus earnings downward revision following the quarterly report (around 10%) was much lower than the stock reaction as current margin pressures (Q2 gross margin was down 500bps year-on-year and operating margin missed expectations by 100bps) are likely to dissipate in the medium term. Zebra agreed to price aggressively its devices to win large-scale contracts in Q2-Q3, hence the rather low margins. But these deals should provide the company with many cross-selling opportunities in the long run at much higher prices and margins.In addition, Zebra's mid-term margins should benefit from a few other drivers, notably: 1) some price increases in certain international markets, including Europe, 2) cost synergies, which are on track with the $150m run rate target by the end of 2016, could continue to contribute to the earnings momentum in 2017 as commented by the CFO, 3) rebranding costs will gradually disappear, 4) and more globally, a higher than expected operating leverage as the company's revenue momentum keeps surprising on the upside.Third, Zebra is deleveraging fast its balance sheet (the Enterprise acquisition was funded with more than $3bn debt) as it made total loan repayments of $80m during the quarter, bringing the total repayment in the first half to $130m. Assuming Zebra delivers over 2016-17 high single-digit revenue growth and double-digit operating income growth (thanks to the operating leverage and higher-than-expected cost synergies), the financial deleveraging should give an additional boost to earnings growth. We estimate that EPS growth should stand between 20% and 30%.Against this backdrop, the stock's valuation appears compelling at 15x 2015 and 12x 2016 earnings as it points to a PEG ratio below 1x.Following several quarters of impressive execution (and it's worth noting that integrating Motorola Enterprise has not been an easy task as the business is much bigger than the core Zebra business), we believe that a single quarter should not and does not change the equity story. We remain convinced that investors will chase the stock again as a play on the Internet of Things and RFID themes."
3016556,76785,2015-03-20T09:40:33-04:00,"Motorola acquisition transformative, company has new clout in marketplace.Integration going as planned, revenue from new Enterprise business substantial.Trades at significant discount to the broader market based on 2015 projected earnings.","Zebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) manufactures and sells printer products, data communications technologies, and also provides other various business enterprise related products. Its products include label printers, RFID printer/encoders, asset tracking solutions, and inventory management solutions. Its products are vital to the lifeblood of any business with scale; without being able to track inventory and people it becomes difficult for businesses to maintain proper efficiency. The company has been around for 1969, an under the radar company that developed into a multi-billion dollar business, expanding to capitalize on growing trends in mobile computing, the cloud, and the Internet of Things. Far from just being a tool of choice for managers in the stockroom of retail stores worldwide, the company's products have wide applications, even including motion capture and tracking in NFL stadiums. The company has a highly diversified client base with worldwide reach and switching costs for its products are generally high, giving the company a steady stream of income from repeat business.In early 2014, Zebra announced that it had acquired the Enterprise business segment from Motorola for $3.45B in cash, an immense acquisition for the company. Zebra spent the equivalent of its market cap at the time (unsurprisingly funding this acquisition with mostly debt, $3.25B of it) in acquiring this business. This enterprise solutions segment was a leading producer of barcode scanners and asset tracking software that it marketed to retailers worldwide. I'm a fan of the guts of the move. The legacy business of barcode printing, thermal transfer ribbons, and all sorts of various tagging and tracking devices may not have been on the way to obsolescence, but this much needed acquisition catapulted the company onto the growth stage, away from the earlier story of a steady stream of revenue. The company needed to either acquire new technologies or develop from within, and management here saw an opportunity to capitalize via an outside acquisition.Market Is WaryMr. Market has been and continues to be skeptical. The announcement of the deal sent shares down in April of 2014 and even after the recent market rally the company only currently sits only 37% higher in share price, or roughly 1.62B higher in market cap, even after acquiring what the company claims to be a greater than $3.5B asset.There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. There was little in the way of physical assets acquired in this deal and the balance sheet now carries nearly $3.4B in total goodwill and intangibles, up from roughly $200M prior to acquisition. $3.25B in debt can weigh heavy on any company of this size. Not helping is the company's low profile and relatively unknown status. With all these factors meshed together it is no surprise that investors are highly suspicious on how the overall integration of this deal will proceed and if the acquired products will produce sustainable, consistent cash flow.Revenue and Cost Structure in the Legacy BusinessGoing forward, the company intends to break its business into two operating segments: Enterprise (mobile computing, data tracking, WLAN products brought in from the Motorola acquisition) and Legacy (barcode printing, location and motion sensing). Breaking the segments this way will give investors improved visibility on the Motorola acquisition.Zebra's legacy business has been no slouch itself. Revenue has grown at a 6% clip since 2010, with a 15% jump during 2014 across all product categories, but especially in desktop and mobile printers. The acquisition of Motorola did more than give the company new assets. Expenses above have fallen (with acquisition and restructuring costs removed), as margins have improved given the impact of lower product costs, lower freight costs, and operating leverage.Since the closing of the acquisition, their overall business has gained momentum as Zebra becomes more well-known name in the business industry. Customer engagement in shows and workshops has improved as the company has garnered new exposure for its advanced technology solutions. Cross-selling opportunities exist and the company now has the portfolio of products to target larger accounts that can benefit from combined operations.Acquisition IntegrationThe Enterprise segment has only reported two months of results thus far, but what we've seen so far is strong. For the two months ended December 31, 2014, the new Enterprise segment reported $482M in revenue. Even though only two months were included, the new Enterprise business provided 60% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014. Gross margins were strong at 44.5%, not far off the legacy business. Management has exceeded street expectations in regards to performance and management guides strong cohesiveness and collaboration:- Anders Gustafsson, CEO, Q4 2014 Earnings ReleaseIntegration costs have been higher. Q4 2014 earnings were impacted by large acquisition and integration costs ($66M during the quarter, $127M throughout the year). While this impacted earnings and left the earnings reaction muted, I'd much prefer they take the time and make sure this is done right rather than run into problems down the road. The company remains confident that it can achieve $150M in cost synergies over the next two years, but investors should continue to see some of these costs passed along in the coming quarters although they have probably peaked.Debt CostsThe company's debt load of $3.25B is made up of two issues. Total interest due in 2015 is expected to be approximately $180M, with this growing to $340M yearly in 2016. Investors in Zebra should expect any and all free cash flow to be used to paying down debt for the foreseeable future. Debt covenants restrict the company's ability to either repurchase shares or initiate a dividend.Zebra had a private offering that raised $1.05B in 7.25% rate, with the principal due in 2022. Paid semi-annually in April and October, the first payment is due to be paid April 15 of this year.The company also has a term loan of $2.2B, variable rate with a floor of 4.75%, which is the rate the company is currently subject to. Payments are made quarterly and started in January of this year. This term loan came with a revolving credit facility of $250M to be used for working capital needs, which the company has not yet meaningfully begun to tap.RisksAs a late earnings reporter, Zebra has given us an idea of how ugly things can be for those that have significant euro exposure. 35% of the company's revenue has come from the EMEA region, with nearly all of that euro/pound denominated. The company has guided significant headwinds to first quarter earnings ($0.60/EPS of negative impact) because of this. Zebra is watching closely to see how other multinationals respond and if there is some room to raise prices in the face of the falling euro.The Enterprise business is also going to be more volatile than the company's legacy business. One of the side effects of having exposure to make large one-time deals is the impact on earnings quarter to quarter, compared to steadiness in the traditional business. This, coupled with the market's fear on whether this integration goes smoothly, could lead to significant downside around earnings. This might be the right reaction; investors need to pay careful attention to profitability within the new segment. Earnings from the legacy Zebra business are not sufficient to cover interest expense on the $3.2B in debt on their own.ConclusionI think Zebra Technologies provides a compelling risk/reward from current prices. If Enterprise continues to generate the revenue it currently does (and that seems to be the case going into 2015 Q1 guidance), the company is trading at basically 1x revenue ($1.15B from legacy business, approximately $3B from Enterprise). At a forward P/E of 12.37, the company trades at a significant discount to the broader market but with incredible growth potential. I've entered into a long position at current prices around $85/share."
3198986,22775,2015-05-20T10:37:17-04:00,"EPS rockets 45% in Q1 and beats consensus by 24% thanks to the successful Enterprise integration.Conservative Q2 guidance leaves room for major upside once again.We are confident in a 20-30% EPS CAGR over coming years, suggesting the current valuation multiples are still cheap.","We have long been praising Zebra's (NASDAQ:ZBRA) high-risk high-reward purchase of Motorola Enterprise, saying that this could be the right acquisition at the right time for Zebra as the unit strengthens Zebra's tracking technologies (bar-code scanning and more importantly RFID) at a time when RFID and the Internet of Things are set to explode. The Q1 earnings release fully confirmed our investment thesis.After an already encouraging Q4 (revenue up in the low-single digits at constant FX compared to flattish or declining revenues in previous quarters), Enterprise improved again in Q2 with 6% growth at constant FX. Meanwhile, Zebra's legacy business continued to perform strongly with revenue growth accelerating to 15% from 11% in Q1. These healthy top-line performances suggest that cross-selling efforts and recent product development investments are paying off and give increased confidence in the company's outlook.Another highlight was management's bullish stance on cost synergies, with the CEO stating on the conference call that Zebra is on track to achieve $150m in synergies by the end of 2016 ($50m run rate in Q1) and that ""the potential exists to achieve even more synergies"".Despite this strong Q1 showing with a 24% EPS beat and 45% EPS growth year-on-year, Zebra's Q2 guidance ($865-895m revenue or 9-13% like-for-like growth at constant FX, $1.00-1.25 EPS) was not specifically impressive as it was only in-line with consensus ($877m and $1.17, respectively). But the upside is significant in our view as the mid-point of the guidance assumes a 20% lower EPS in Q1 than in Q2 despite similar revenue and several positives (higher costs synergies, initial price increases in Europe that will boost both the top and bottom lines).Following the early success of the Enterprise integration, we now have a pretty good visibility on the Zebra's earnings power. In our view, Zebra could at least deliver high-single digit revenue growth and double digit EBITDA growth thanks to the operating leverage and higher-than-expected cost synergies. This should spark a 20-30% EPS CAGR over coming years given the company's high financial leverage (more than $3bn debt to fund the Enterprise acquisition).In light of this expected earnings growth, we believe Zebra remains cheap at 18x 2015 earnings and remain convinced that investors will keep chasing the stock to play the promises of the Internet of Things and RFID."
3030716,22775,2015-03-26T10:55:27-04:00,"Q4 earnings and Q1 guidance failed to impress the Street.But we believe the Motorola Enterprise asset, which has long been a source of concern, is now de-risked.Enterprise’s integration is on track and revenue growth is ticking up.","Enterprise's integration on track, revenue growth ticking upThe Motorola Enterprise unit has been a source of concern for many Zebra (NASDAQ:ZBRA) investors and analysts since its announced acquisition in April last year for $3.45bn. As detailed in our previous articles, Enterprise, which was funded with a huge $3.25bn debt (compared to Zebra's current $4.8bn market cap), has indeed a poor operating track record with at best flattish revenues in recent quarters and much larger revenues than Zebra ($2.5bn vs. $1bn), suggesting potential integration issues.We have been much more upbeat on Enterprise, saying that this deal could be the right acquisition at the right time for Zebra as the unit will strengthen Zebra's tracking technologies (bar-code scanning and more importantly RFID) at a time when RFID and the Internet of Things are set to explode.Importantly, the risk/reward appears attractive. The downside risk is limited as expectations for Enterprise are pretty low. But should Zebra succeed in reviving the business, the value creation potential would be huge in light of the company's high financial leverage.Clearly, Zebra's Q4 figures reported last week confirm our bullish thesis as Enterprise had a much improved quarter with revenue up in the low-single digits year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Also, management commented during the conference call that the integration process is on track and that the company is ""on target to achieve the $150 million in synergies by the end of 2016 with $50 million to $75 million in savings this year.""Meanwhile, Zebra's core business continued to perform strongly with the company reporting Q4 revenue up 11%, confirming that Zebra's recent product development investments are paying off and giving confidence in the company's top-line outlook.Strong EPS growth outlookWe believe the Q1 guidance ($870-890m revenue, or 6-8% growth at constant FX) gives a pretty good indication of the company's earnings power in coming years (assuming no additional FX headwinds).In our view, Zebra could easily reach high-single digit revenue growth given that it has identified significant cross-selling opportunities and has now completed the integration of its global sales organization . This revenue growth, combined with some operating leverage and the Enterprise cost synergies, should enable EBITDA to grow at least in the teens over coming years and EPS to grow at a 20-30% CAGR given the company's high financial leverage.In light of this expected earnings growth, we believe Zebra remains cheap at 18x 2015 earnings. And we remain convinced that investors will keep chasing the stock to play the promises of the RFID technology and the Internet of Things."
3543716,78265,2015-09-30T15:40:24-04:00,"Zebra Technologies' shares have fallen dramatically since we wrote a bearish piece on the company in May. We thought we'd check in to see if they're now cheap enough to buy.They're not. The shares remain optimistically priced.This optimism is strange to us in light of the fact that operating profits remain mediocre. Even if we strip out acquisition related expenses, the company is sub-par. Avoid.","Shares of Zebra Technologies Corp. (NASDAQ:ZBRA) are down about 34% since we posted our bearish piece on the company back in May. After shares had collapsed, a fellow Seeking Alpha contributor suggested that margin pressures would dissipate in 2016, so we thought we would check in on the company. Zebra wasn't a compelling investment at $109. Maybe it's a compelling investment at $72. It's not.Operating YieldThe first thing we do when analyzing any business is to compare the level of operating profits the company generates relative to the amount of capital employed. The reason for this is simple enough. First, operating profits are the source of all shareholder wealth, so it makes sense to pay close attention to them. They are the source of dividends, growth in book value via retained earnings and so on. Secondly, operating profits are the compensation we receive for taking on the risk of investing. The future is uncertain and we're not that good at predicting it than we think we are. In order to engage in this exercise, we're compensated with the possibility of gain. That's why operating profit (and not revenue, and not future opportunity and not ""the dynamics of an industry"") is the central pillar of a reasonable investment process.We want to compare the level of operating profits to the amount of capital provided by owners and (increasingly in this case) creditors. Specifically, we compare this yield (profits/capital) to the risk-free rate, and if the profit yield is high enough, we consider the company investment worthy. In the case of companies like Zebra, we're looking for a level of operating profit about 5% greater than the risk-free rate. Since the 10-year government bond is currently priced to yield about 2%, we're looking for a level of operating profits here in the neighborhood of 7%.To be fair to Zebra, we calculated two yields. One where the acquisition-related expenses were included (i.e. reality) and one where we ""give the company a break"" and treat these acquisition expenses like they didn't happen. On the one hand, stripping out such expenses is reasonable because we're trying to get a sense of the ongoing profitability of the firm. On the other hand, the expenses are a reality and should be accounted for. We've calculated both and will let the reader decide which is more relevant. Whether we decide to strip out such expenses or leave them in is largely beside the point. The company doesn't generate sufficient operating profit in either case.Source: Company filingsSomeone will probably complain that this analysis is ""backward looking"" and that the future will not resemble the past. Margins are going to improve. The company will be able to turn revenue into net income at an increasing rate, etc. It's obviously true that the future will be different from the past, but it misses the point. The point of exercises like these is not to review the recent profitability of a public company (fascinating though such a history lesson would be). The point is to see how near (or how far) the company currently is from our acceptable hurdle rate. In the case of companies like Zebra, with all of their risks and opportunities that we know about (and all of those that we can't), we need a level of operating profit of about 7%. Since the company delivers 2.5% less than that, we know by how much the firm would need to improve before we consider it investment worthy. Since it's ~35% too low at the moment, we can say pretty definitively that, holding all else equal, we'll need profits to rise to about $151 million before we'd consider investing. These backward looking analyses provide us a starting point from which to perform a gap analysis. They allow us to apply some discipline to our investment process.Optimism Embedded in PriceFor better or worse (probably worse), investing involves more than just finding a profitable business and buying in. We access the future cash flows to these businesses via shares that trade in the capital markets. The trouble is that the short-term price movements of the shares reflect more about the market's mood than they do about the underlying business. How much can a company really change in a day? This disconnect between the fundamentals and the mood of the market can go on for years at a time.For that reason, we need to spend some time talking about the behavior of the stock as distinct from the business. When we think about the behavior of the stock, we specifically want to avoid overly optimistic assessments reflected in prices. If the market has great expectations for a company, they will bid the shares up in anticipation of great things. This represents the worst possible payoff to marginal shareholders. If management achieves the goals imposed on them by a hopeful audience, shares may not move very much, as expectations are already ""baked in."" More likely, a combination of competition, slow economic growth, the unforeseen integration problem and a host of other issues conspire to dash hopeful expectations. The result of this is that the market may switch polarity quite quickly and go from being irrationally optimistic to irrationally pessimistic.One of the ways we judge the level of optimism surrounding an investment is to compare the current and the forward P/E multiples. If the forward multiple is too low, that's one sign to us that the market is too optimistic.Given that Zebra has lost $2.73 over the past four quarters, it doesn't have a TTM (trailing twelve month) PE multiple. The market has assigned it a forward multiple, though, of 10.5%. Holding all else constant, then, the market is forecasting earnings to grow from $-2.73 to $7.01. We consider such a turnaround to be an exceedingly optimistic forecast. Since excessive optimism represents a tremendous risk, this is another reason to avoid the shares.ConclusionShares of Zebra Technologies Corp. are down quite a bit since we wrote our bearish piece. We caution investors against believing that the shares are now ""cheap."" In our view, they remain overpriced and for that reason we recommend that people continue to avoid Zebra Technologies."

3001326,67695,2015-03-15T03:17:44-04:00,"Zebra has been smashing analyst estimates recently, growing at a very solid rate, and is coming into earnings with strong price momentum.The ""smart money"" is moderately bullish on the stock as it heads into earnings, with short interest low and institutions buying into the stock.Zebra releases on Tuesday morning, with the analyst consensus calling for $0.95 EPS and $838 million in sales. We expect the company to beat on both those numbers.","A) IntroductionThis week is relatively light on earnings with just 151 companies in the entire NYSE releasing, according to our data provider (Zacks). This report is the first in a series of articles in which we highlight stocks that have a good chance of a significant earnings-related move. The stock we'll be discussing in this article is Zebra Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:ZBRA).Earnings are obviously a very critical time for investors, as stocks often see very big moves in their price according to how their numbers come out relative to estimates. We've identified a variety of different factors that investors should watch for that give an indication of whether a company will beat earnings or not. These factors are: the company's track record of beating earnings estimates, the stock's price momentum heading into earnings, and the company's overall growth rate. We've been using these factors to accurately predict earnings for a few months, as evidenced by our very high ""Analyst Confidence Score"" of 8.3, which is built on over 1,000 estimates on the Estimize platform.SourceB) Zebra Technologies Earnings BreakdownZebra manufactures and sells printing technologies, which can print barcodes, receipts, ID cards, wristbands, and etc. As we can see from the chart below, Zebra releases on Tuesday morning, with the Wall Street Consensus calling for $0.95 EPS and $837.96 million in sales:SourceZebra has been smashing estimates recently, beating the last quarter EPS consensus by 9.4% and the revenue consensus by 4.2%. It has now beaten on EPS estimates five times in a row, and beaten on revenue estimates six times in a row. Zebra is also growing at a strong clip as well, increasing EPS year-over-year by 21% last quarter and revenue by 15.1%. Stocks that grow at a strong rate are much more likely to beat estimates, as analysts tend to be slow to react to growth. Lastly, we'll take a look at how the stock's price is trading into earnings. The table below shows Zebra's 6-month price performance versus the electronic equipment industry group, technology sector, and overall market averages:SourceZebra technologies has gained over 18% in the last six months, which is much higher than its industry group (2.15%), sector (6.65%), and overall market (4.51%) averages over the same period. Overall, we project Zebra to beat on EPS estimates by a wide margin (+7.5%) and to beat on revenue estimates by a moderate amount (approximately 5%). Zebra's stock price has a habit recently of actually underperforming after it releases great numbers. The stock dropped 1.5% on the day of earnings release last quarter (November 4th, 2014) and dropped 7% the quarter before that (August 5th, 2014). With that being said, it also gained 2.5% on the day of the May 6th release, gained 14.3% on the February 19th earnings release day and gained 8.9% on the November 5th, 2013 earnings release. On average, stocks that beat on earnings estimates tend to go up about 2% on the day of release, though it's tough to predict on a case-by-case basis.C) Smart Money BreakdownAnother thing we like to look at heading into an earnings release is how the ""Smart Money"" on the street is playing the stock. We consider the ""smart money"" to be short sellers, company insiders, and institutions. Each one has an edge over the market in there own way, and we find it pays to watch what they do. A breakdown of what the ""smart money"" is doing with Zebra is provided below:It seems like company insiders have recently shed a small fraction of their positions over the last few months, though that mostly follows an overall market trend. Institutions have increased their positions by almost 5% over the last three months, which is much higher than the industry group, sector, and overall market averages (thus putting it in the top 20% decile). Short sellers have also mostly stayed away from the stock, with a very low short float of 2.68%. Overall, the ""Smart Money"" on the street is neutral to moderately bullish on the Zebra.In conclusion, our models are quite optimistic on Zebra beating the EPS and revenue consensus projections as they've done so many times before. But given the fact that the stock price has actually declined the last few quarters on an earnings beat, we don't recommend investors to initiate a position before earnings."

That said, the stock has been in consolidation mode since July as the recently acquired Motorola Enterprise unit has been performing poorly and offers limited short-term visibility.Revenue at the Motorola unit has been declining mid- to high-single digit for several quarters and is not expected to pick up in Q4 according to Zebra due notably to tough comps. As for Motorola's Q4 earnings, Zebra was not able to provide a guidance as the integration process comes with many complexities.In our previous article, we said that this acquisition did not come without risks as the Motorola unit has much larger revenues than Zebra ($2.5bn vs. $1bn), suggesting potential integration issues. That said, we are not specifically concerned for now and believe the Motorola weakness is only temporary (the integration process is probably distracting management from daily business).Hence, we stick to our view that this Motorola deal could be the right acquisition at the right time for Zebra: the unit will strengthen Zebra's tracking technologies (bar-code scanning and more importantly RFID) at a time when RFID and the Internet of Things are set to explode.Importantly, we think the risk/reward is attractive. The downside risk is limited as expectations for Motorola are pretty low. But should Zebra succeed in reviving the Motorola business, the value creation potential would be huge in light of the company's high financial leverage (the $3.45bn price tag was mainly funded with debt).Core business is fine, thanks for askingWhile investors have focused on the Motorola acquisition, it's worth noting that Zebra's core business has been impressive lately with the company reporting Q3 revenue and EPS 3% and 7% above consensus respectively and providing a strong Q4 guidance.In our view, the organic revenue growth acceleration to 13% in Q3 was the key highlight, confirming that Zebra's recent product development investments are paying off and giving confidence in the company's top-line outlook. Zebra now markets products enabling it to serve new verticals such as hospitals (use of Zebra wristbands for identification of patients and connection to electronic health records) and sports (tracking player movement in real-time).In conclusion, we reiterate our positive stance on the stock. The Motorola deal and the promises of the RFID technology are likely to keep Zebra under the spotlight."
2397105,22775,2014-08-07T15:45:14-04:00,"Zebra, which provides location and tracking solutions, is an attractive play on the RFID and Internet of Things themes.
        The company is in the process of acquiring Motorola Enterprise for $3.45bn, mainly through debt.
        The Motorola unit has been performing poorly, but Zebra has a real opportunity to revive it, helped by the Internet of Things secular trend.
        The value creation potential could be huge in light of Zebra's high financial leverage.","Motorola overshadows Zebra's strong Q2 earningsWe highlighted in a January 9 article two plays on the RFID (radio-frequency identification) and Internet of Things themes, Avery Dennison (NYSE:AVY) and Zebra (NASDAQ:ZBRA). As a reminder, Zebra is a provider of location and tracking solutions and manufactures tags, labels and specific printers. The company is taking part in the RFID ""revolution"" through the production of RFID tags and printer/encoders designed to write to RFID chips embedded in labels and tags.Zebra, which had already reported a strong Q1, delivered once again a quarterly beat in Q2 (revenues and EPS 1% and 3% above consensus respectively) as revenue growth remained healthy (+14%, o/w mid single digit organic growth) and as the gross margin continued its upward trend (+150bps). It also provided a Q3 guidance in line with consensus: revenue of $285-295m and EPS of $0.81-0.91 vs. $291m and $0.88. This confirms that Zebra's recent product development investments are now paying off and give confidence in the company's top-line outlook. The company now markets products enabling it to serve new verticals such as hospitals (use of Zebra wristbands for identification of patients and connection to electronic health records) and sports (tracking player movement in real-time).Unfortunately, this solid report was overshadowed by a poor performance from the Motorola enterprise unit Zebra is in the process of acquiring. The unit reported a 8% revenue decline due to weak demand in Asia and to ""supply chain and IT execution issues related to transitioning business processes"". The -8% marks a worsening of the top-line momentum for the unit which reported -2% revenue growth last year (vs. +4% for Zebra). But we are not specifically concerned and believe that this weakness is only temporary as the current sale to Zebra is probably distracting management from daily business.Obviously, this deal does not come without risks: the Motorola unit has much larger revenues ($2.5bn vs. $1bn), suggesting potential integration issues going forward, and Zebra's financial leverage (the $3.45bn price tag is funded mainly with debt) could become an issue and slam Zebra's earnings and valuation if the integration does not go as expected. Nevertheless, we believe that this Motorola deal could be the right acquisition at the right time for Zebra: the Motorola unit will strengthen Zebra's tracking technologies (bar-code scanning and more importantly RFID) at a time when RFID and the Internet of Things are set to explode.RFID likely to become ubiquitousUnlike the barcode tags & printers market which is mature, the RFID segment is at a nascent stage and is growing globally across all verticals. RFID's traditional application has been in demand recently: RFID labels make the tracking and location of items much easier and more efficient than barcode technology. As such the protection against thefts on retailers' shelves, in the supply chain (in-house thefts) or in sensitive areas (hospitals) is improving.The other main application of RFID tags is inventory and shipments management, i.e. monitoring inventories to avoid sold-out situations and eliminating shipment errors.As RFID is still a ""new"" technology, most retailers that have decided to use it are rolling out RFID selectively… but adoption is likely to increase very soon as many new applications are emerging. As the technology improves, RFID tags can now extract and record data from a variety of items such as temperature-sensitive products (drugs, biomedical items…, with RFID allowing users to track the temperature of their goods) or basic materials. Also note that the FDA has approved RFID tags for implantation within the human body.These new applications and the printers increasing affordability (some printers now sell for less than $2,000) give confidence in the RFID's ability to become ubiquitous. According to IDTechEx, the global RFID market (includes tags, readers, software and services) will reach $9.2bn by 2014, up 16% from $7.88bn in 2013 (the number was already up 13% from the 2012 level). And the mid-term outlook offers strong prospects with research institutes forecasting that 80bn items will be connected to the Internet in 2020, directly or through a device, vs. 15bn in 2012, i.e. a c.23% CAGR.Value creation potential is hugeTherefore, we consider that Zebra has a real opportunity to revive the Motorola business, helped by the Internet of Things secular trend. If Zebra succeeds, the value creation potential from the Motorola deal could be huge in light of the company's high financial leverage.In all, this deal, combined with the promises of the RFID technology, are likely to keep Zebra under the spotlight.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

237013,23899,2010-11-16T03:56:13-05:00,,"by Andy ObermuellerYou are taking part in a revolution.  If you pay to drive through a toll booth, or you travel abroad, or in  some cases use your credit card, you're a willing participant. But this  handful of actions is just a sliver of what's to come.  In fact, it's just a tiny fraction of what's already taken place.  Everything from manufacturing, to retail, to energy production has felt  the impact of this revolution. Despite the broad application this  technology has already seen, however, there's no doubt we're still in  the early innings.   And if you're an investor like me who is always looking for game-changing ideas, I think I've found one. It's RFID.   RFID is an acronym for radio frequency identification. The technology  comes in the form of tags that emit a radio signal as they pass a  scanner. This signal is pretty much the same as a bar code -- a long  number that can provide a ton of information. But unlike bar codes, you  don't have to scan each one individually with a laser; you can use a  radio receiver, which makes it much easier to scan items that are  densely packed or are moving quickly.  And while the technology has been in use behind-the-scenes, it is just  now moving into our daily lives. RFID tags are used in your E-ZPass --  the device tollbooth scanners read as you drive by and ""magically""  charge you. Some credit cards have RFID tags, allowing users to simply  wave their card across a reader, instead of handing a card to a cashier,  swiping it through the scanner, and then signing a receipt. And all  newly issued passports contain an RFID chip that is used to cross-check  the information printed in the passport for improved security.  Hundreds of practical, profitable applications But I don't classify a few million chips put into passports or toll tags  as a game-changer. No, the real opportunity is with this technology's  application for industry.  RFID is fascinating from an industrial standpoint. In short, the product  helps improve efficiency. That might not sound like the sexiest goal on  the planet, but there isn't a business manager in the world that  wouldn't gladly spend cold hard cash if it means saving tons of money  down the line. And that's exactly what's happening in all sorts of  places. Take a look for yourself at how expansive the usage of RFID  truly is...  Manufacturing: It used to take seven workers  to transfer, unload, and manually enter the shipping / receiving data for  parts and material shipments at a Boeing (NYSE: BA)  plant in Washington. It took two hours a day per employee to read and  record all the bar codes from each shipment. And there was no guarantee of accuracy.   Enter RFID. Boeing put RFID tags on these goods. The tags are  automatically read by a scanner on the door frame, the data is sent to  the warehouse management systems, which automatically generate a wire transfer  to the supplier when goods are received. Now Boeing needs one worker,  the system is perfectly accurate, and the savings in labor costs alone  paid for the hardware investment in just six months.   Asset management: The Texas Tech University  Health Sciences Center has tons of state-of-the-art equipment for its  students and faculty. A lot of them, of course, are small, and the  school needed a way to keep tabs on everything.   Bar codes were onerous to use and ultimately proved error-prone and  ineffective. But installing RFID scanners and tagging the equipment  could create a real-time picture of what devices were where. This  application has hundreds of other uses, from law firm files to inventory  control on car lots.   Loss prevention: Airline passenger volume is  projected to hit four billion people by 2019, which will, at current  levels of loss, generate nearly 70 million lost bags a year.   Fun fact: Each lost bag costs the airline about $130. That means in just  the span of a few years lost baggage will be a $9.1 billion problem  each year.  Fitting bags with RFID tags is a simple solution to a complex problem.  The tags can be read at dozens of points throughout the underbelly of an  airport as they move from point to point, ensuring that they are routed  and loaded correctly. The more bags loaded quickly and correctly, the  better an airline's on-time performance and customer satisfaction.  That's dollars and cents -- billions of them -- that can be bought back  and added to the carrier's bottom line with a relatively modest RFID investment.  Retailing: Beginning with jeans, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT)  is testing the technology, which can help a customer see if the jeans  they want are in stock and literally where they are. The company could  add this capability to thousands of products in its stores.    When it affects this many areas (and believe me, this is just a taste),  it's not a question of if RFID will catch on, but which stocks are  going to profit the most from the revolution.  There are a number of options in the space, and to be honest, I'm still  researching the field to pin down my favorite. But if you want to start  your own search, you might start with a company called Zebra Technologies (Nasdaq: ZBRA).  The shares have been on a tear recently -- they're up +49% since July.   I'm keeping an eye on them and doing some further hunting elsewhere as  well.(To view Zebra Technologies recent Earnings Call click here.)Original PostDisclosure: Neither Andy Obermueller nor StreetAuthority, LLC hold positions in any securities mentioned in this article"

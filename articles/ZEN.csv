        Zendesk did see revenue growth decelerate to 24% y/y from 27% y/y in the prior quarter, but averted the much steeper deceleration it had guided to.
        The company noted that churn is returning to pre-coronavirus levels.
        Profitability has also taken a big step upward, and Zendesk's free cash flow is surging.","Zendesk's (ZEN) quarterly performance this year has been a roller coaster ride. Each quarterly release has brought with it stock price reactions of ~10% or more, and the third quarter was no different. Thankfully - after last quarter's beating, which Zendesk suffered due to a poor third-quarter outlook - Zendesk managed to climb above the low bar it set and sounded off an optimistic note for the post-pandemic recovery. Shares of Zendesk are up ~10% in after-hours trading after reporting Q3 results:Among all the software and technology companies that saw huge lifts this year due to the remote-work trend, Zendesk was one notable holdout thanks to its customer base. Serving primarily sales and customer-support teams, Zendesk has suffered from much heavier-than-usual churn this year as companies downsized their customer-facing staff in response to demand slowdowns wrought by the coronavirus. That, in turn, worried investors about Zendesk's growth trajectory - which, even pre-pandemic was causing concern as Zendesk's growth was slowing down from the >30% range last year to the mid-20s this year.Yet Zendesk has muscled through what it believes to be the worst point in the pandemic, and right now, I believe more focus should turn on Zendesk's profitability. The company is doing exactly what all enterprise SaaS companies should be doing as they scale: as growth rates slow down, Zendesk is tightening its belt and capitalizing on operating efficiencies in order to drive substantial profitability gains. Zendesk's operating margins and free cash flow have gotten considerably healthier - and in an unsure market that has begun to shy away from expensively valued, cash-burning tech stocks, Zendesk's improvements in profitability will help it to maintain bullish sentiment.Looking longer term - Zendesk's product and competitive advantages remain clear. The company remains a best-of-breed vendor for customer service and customer support teams. When you're on a website and open up a chat window to discuss an issue with customer support, there's a good chance that seamless experience was powered by Zendesk behind the scenes. And because customer support is so deeply ingrained into a company's operations, Zendesk enjoys a very steady recurring revenue base, shakable only by black-swan events like the coronavirus.I'm sufficiently encouraged by the strength of Zendesk's Q3 results to go bullish on this stock again; additionally, Zendesk still retains a fairly conservative valuation (at least against most other enterprise SaaS stocks). At present post-earnings share prices near $115, Zendesk trades at a $13.28 billion market cap. After netting off the $1.35 billion of cash and $1.06 billion of convertible debt on Zendesk's most recent balance sheet, the company's enterprise value is $12.99 billion. Versus Wall Street's FY21 revenue estimate of $1.26 billion (+24% y/y; data from Yahoo Finance), Zendesk trades at 10.3x EV/FY21 revenue. That's certainly not cheap - but considering many other SaaS companies growing revenue in the 20-30% range are trading at mid-teens multiples, I think there's room for upside in Zendesk - especially as the company is just beginning to ramp up its profitability.Stay long here and buy Zendesk on its recent strong execution.Let's now dive into Zendesk's most recent quarterly results in greater detail. The Q3 earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Zendesk Q3 resultsSource: Zendesk Q3 shareholder letterZendesk's third-quarter revenue grew 24% y/y to $261.9 million, substantially beating Wall Street's estimates of $253.7 million, or +21% y/y. Recall that when Zendesk reported second-quarter results and guided to $250-$255 million in Q3 revenue, the company warned that it was facing ""end-market demand challenges"" and ""higher levels of contraction compared to historical trends."" As previously mentioned, this is due to the fact that Zendesk concentrates on sales and customer-support staff, and so Zendesk - which generally prices its products on a per-seat basis - suffers directly when companies cut support agents.In substantially crossing its internal hurdles for Q3, Zendesk's tone on the pace of its recovery has shifted to a more optimistic one. In particular, Zendesk notes that its churn rates are trending back downward pre-COVID 19 levels. Though the chart below doesn't show any units on the Y-axis, we can see the directional trends here: after peaking in Q2, Zendesk's churn rates are reverting back down to historical levels, while the company is also seeing a pickup in new bookings.Figure 2. Zendesk churn trendsSource: Zendesk Q3 shareholder letterIn commenting on sales traction in the third quarter in its shareholder letter, Zendesk described a V-type recovery that saw customer response rebound in Q3 after falling in Q2:Zendesk's net revenue retention rate also improved to 112% in Q3, one point better than 111% in Q2, within the company's long-term target range of 110-120%. New account additions are also picking up healthily - as of the end of the September quarter, Zendesk counted 169.6k of paid account on its platform, representing a sequential net add of 5.4k - above Zendesk's usual sequential add of ~3-4k.Figure 3. Zendesk customer metricsSource: Zendesk Q3 shareholder letterZendesk's profitability results were equally encouraging this quarter. Zendesk's pro forma operating margins bumped up to 9.5%, 450bps better (nearly double) compared to 5.0% in the year-ago quarter. A multitude of factors are supporting Zendesk's margin expansion: alongside the natural leverage that comes with scale, as well as the temporary stoppage of travel for sales teams, Zendesk is also scaling back its staff and real estate footprint. It is planning to vacate two of its leased office spaces in its headquarters its of San Francisco. Like many other Silicon Valley companies, Zendesk has taken advantage of the coronavirus and the remote-work surge to rethink its geographic footprint and shift resources out of higher-expense locales. Figure 4. Zendesk margin trendsSource: Zendesk Q3 shareholder letterWe note that when we add together Zendesk's 24.4% revenue growth this quarter to 9.5% pro forma operating margins, Zendesk's ""rule of 40"" score of 34 comes very close to hitting the threshold of 40 - indicating a strong balance between growth and profitability. We note as well that pro forma EPS of $0.17 smashed Wall Street's expectations of $0.11, while Zendesk's Q3 free cash flow also grew nearly 4x to $24.9 million.The most important update Zendesk delivered is that after seeing churn peak in Q2, Zendesk is seeing churn trend down to pre-pandemic levels as well as seeing customer bookings begin to pick up again. The company's message is far more optimistic than at the end of last quarter, when Zendesk was warning of impending deceleration with no near-term end in sight."

(ZEN) recently reported Q2-20 results, with quarterly revenue of $246.7m (up 27% YoY) ahead of CapIQ estimate of $240.5m. Second-quarter EPS was also ahead of expectations, reaching $0.14 vs. CapIQ estimate of $0.10.Data by YChartsThe company saw healthy demand from both smaller and enterprise customers, offsetting the weakness seen in their midsize clients. Net dollar expansion rate dropped to 111%, lower than historical values but still in line with the 110-120% projected by management in a stable economic environment. Given the company's exposure to small and mid-sized customers, the drop in retention rate is likely macro-driven and the value should drift back as the economy slowly recovers from COVID-19. GAAP gross margin came in at 75.1% for Q2-20, up 470 basis points YoY; non-GAAP gross margin was 78.2%, up 360 basis points YoY. Gross margin expansion was largely driven by the constant optimization of cloud resources. Operating margin expanded by 14 percentage points, mainly driven by gross margin expansion and prudent expense management.Despite the positive quarter, Zendesk saw its price drop as much as 11.4% after the announcement, as investors raised concerns on the company's ability to continue growing in this new economic environment. According to the company's Q2-20 press release:The stock quickly rebounded and is now up almost 24% YTD at the time of writing.For Q3-20, management expects revenue between $250m-255m (20% YoY growth at the midpoint), with non-GAAP operating income between $10m and $14m. While Zendesk will continue to provide guidance only on a quarterly basis, management expects free cash flows to be positive during the second half of 2020, with FY2020 FCF projected to be neutral to slightly positive as cost-cutting initiatives are realized. In 2015, the company set the ambitious goal of reaching $1bn in total revenue by 2020; five years later and despite the current economic environment, management is still optimistic they will reach this goal.In June 2020, for the fifth year in a row, Gartner named Zendesk a leader in its famous Magic Quadrant for the CRM Customer Engagement Center.Key catalysts include:Key risks include:Zendesk is a leader in the customer service and engagement software space; the company was founded with a focus on simplicity and the aim to provide a faster and better customer support than existing solutions. In recent quarters, larger customers drove more than 40% of annual recurring revenue, and enterprise clients are generally stickier than SMB customers.The company has been successful in the typical land and expand strategy, as Zendesk usually lands a client with one single service (or a limited number of services) and then expands its offering by cross-selling additional services to existing customers. Support remains Zendesk's largest solution, with around 80% of revenue coming from existing customers. The company has a substantial market opportunity ahead, as management estimates a total addressable market of around $20 billion:Source: Zendesk's Investor Event DeckCompetition includes tech giants like Microsoft, salesforce.com and Oracle (ORCL), but the target market is large enough and competitive overlap remains relatively small, and Zendesk can successfully carve its own niche by simply providing quality services at a reasonable price to larger SMB customers.Zendesk offers a variety of applications that integrate with one another and with other popular and legacy applications through APIs. Its flagship product is Zendesk Support, which helps companies tracking and resolving customers' queries across various departments. Other key applications include Chat, Talk, Guide, Explore, Sell, and Connect (Support, Chat, Guide and Talk are often offered as a bundle as well). The company also launched Sunshine in 2018, a CRM platform with development tools that allows clients access to customers' statistics and tools for further customization. Prices go from $5 per agent per month for the most basic version of Support, while the Zendesk suite is priced at $149 per agent per month for the enterprise version (for the annual subscription term; monthly subscription term comes in at $179).The company acquired its first 10,000 customers through search engine marketing and, since then, it has gradually expanded its offering, making it more suitable for larger SMB customers. In 10 years, the company went from 4,850 paid customers account in 2010 to 157,000 accounts as of January 2020:Source: Zendesk Investor Presentation - CEO noteToday, more than 40% of Zendesk's AAR in any quarter comes from clients with more than 100 customer service agents. Interestingly, even if enterprise customers (500 or more employees) continue to rise in Zendesk's revenue mix, the company still offers free trials of its software.Zendesk benefits from high switching costs, primarily due to:Once customers start using one of Zendesk's software, they are locked in an ecosystem of software products that work seamlessly together. Given these high switching costs, customers tend to change software providers only if strictly necessary and Zendesk has been extremely successful in capitalizing on its competitive position, as switching costs have historically helped the company to grow its top-line while maintaining a healthy dollar-based expansion rate. In any quarter, 80% of revenue comes from existing customers, while dollar-based net retention rate has been 115-120% over the last several years.High switching costs, a history of strong top-line growth, large addressable market and a unique position in the larger SMB customers space make Zendesk a company worth considering.Zendesk is a software development company that provides SaaS services to SMB and enterprise customers.Source: S&P Capital IQIts flagship product, Zendesk Support, provides clients with the ability to track, prioritize and solve customer need across multiple channels. Other services integrate perfectly with the Zendesk Support platform and include Zendesk Chat, Zendesk Guide and Zendesk Talk:Together with Zendesk Support, the company offers the Zendesk Sell platform, which is a CRM software that complements the company's aim to offer an overall better customer experience. Other products include: Zendesk Sell Suite which provides Sell and Chat plus other features, Zendesk Gather which gives companies the ability to provide customer service though online forums, Zendesk Duet, which includes both Support and Sell for a single price, Zendesk Sunshine, a CRM platform that allows companies to gather and integrate data collected through other Zendesk's services, and Zendesk Sunshine Conversations, a messaging platform which helps companies reaching customers through social media messaging. Finally, with the Zendesk Support Suite bundle, the company provides access to Support, Chat, Talk Guide and Sell for a unique price.Almost all revenues are coming from subscription fees, which mainly include fees from Zendesk Support and, to a lesser extent, from Talk, Guide, Chat and Sell. Subscription fees are recurring revenue which are usually non-refundable, regardless of the actual use of the service.

As of June 30, 2020, net dollar-based retention reached 111%, and management sees a possible further decline in the metric as the company continues to grow its top line and add larger paid customer accounts.As of Q2-20, more than half (52.9%) of total revenue are coming from the United States, with the EMEA region representing 27.9% of total revenue:Source: Zendesk's 10-Q report, June 2020As the company keeps moving upmarket to serve large enterprise customers and deliver more complex solutions, it is expected to offer longer-term contracts, thus increasing its remaining performance obligations (RPO). RPO is a key operating metric, as it represents future revenues that are under contract but have not yet been recognized. In Q2-20, both short-term RPO and long-term RPO were impacted by a reduction in average subscription length, driven by uncertainty of economic conditions following COVID-19:Source: Q2-20 Shareholder LetterIn May 2019, Zendesk completed the acquisition of Smooch Technologies Holdings ULC, a developer of messaging technology, for a total consideration of $72 million. In Q2-20, the company finalized the accounting procedures and recognized a total Goodwill of $58.3 million generated from the transaction:Source: Zendesk's 10-Q report, June 2020The company is in a solid financial position, with safe balance sheet and improving margins. Capital has historically been allocated to growth and acquisitions (with a handful of deals totaling around $150 million), with no buybacks or dividends on the horizon. Zendesk currently has $997.3m Cash and Equivalents available and around $1.2bn in interest-bearing debt (including capital leases). In June 2020, the company issued $1.15bn in convertible senior notes at 0.625%, maturing June 15, 2025.Free cash flow margin has historically been in the mid- to upper-single digit range over the last several years ($18.2m TTM FCF) and it is expected to gradually improve as the company keeps growing its top line and its EBITDA margin (expected to reach 13.2% by FY2022).Co-founder Mikkel Svane has served as CEO since 2007; the other two co-founders are Alex Aghassipour (Chief Product Officer) and Morten Primdahl (who served as CTO until 2017). The founders successfully scaled Zendesk from the startup phase through its IPO and continue to operate the company today. In 2016, Elena Gomez joined as the company's CFO; prior to this, she held different financial leadership roles at salesforce.com.Management has successfully allocated capital to scale the business, with occasional small acquisitions. Management's compensation consists of base salary, cash performance bonuses and long-term equity incentives, with incentives based on revenue growth, operating margins, bookings and individual performance assessment (Zendesk's management compensation is in line with compensation programs of peers).Analysts are expecting Zendesk to reach $1.57bn revenue (24.3% CAGR from FY2019 to FY2022) and $206.96m EBITDA by FY2022, with EBITDA margins significantly improving versus FY2019:Source: S&P Capital IQZendesk has historically traded at a premium to big tech names like Microsoft and salesfoce.com, but in recent months the gap looks much smaller than before:Source: S&P Capital IQ, proprietary researchZendesk currently trades at 12.5x LTM EV/Revenue, roughly in line with public comps:Source: S&P Capital IQ, Finviz, proprietary researchAs size reduces, comparables seem to trade at a slightly lower multiple.

Note: average Wall Street analyst price target is $108.78, 10.7% upside at the time of writing.Zendesk does business with customers of all sizes, but for the moment, SMB clients still represent its key segment. This poses a couple of operational risks:Even though Zendesk is not directly competing with big tech names, targeting bigger clients will inevitably bring increased competition from the likes of Microsoft, salesforce.com and Oracle.Moreover, as Zendesk keeps expanding to large customers, the company will likely have to expand its sales and servicing headcount to deal with more complex requests. SMB customers are usually more willing to go the ""self-service"" route, enterprise customers require a much higher level of service.1.

These solutions enable enterprises to improve customer service experience through the unification of multiple communication channels and user data into a single software. Zendesk's service-first approach to customer relationship management differentiates its offering from traditional CRM software. My investment thesis for Zendesk is based on the following points:In this article, we will explore Zendesk's business in greater depth, after which we will run it through the L.A.

In comparison to traditional CRM products, Zendesk's offerings are uniquely differentiated by the unification of customer communication and data across multiple channels and business units, which eventually results in simplified and enhanced customer engagement across self-service, messaging, chat, phone, and email.Source: Zendesk Investor Day Product PresentationI think of Zendesk as a next-gen CRM company due to its extensive focus on the enhancement of customer experience using the latest technologies in AI/ML and data analytics. In 2020, Zendesk is slated to achieve $1 billion in ARR for the first time in its history. This is a significant achievement for the company considering revenues of just $83 million in 2014 (at IPO). Since its IPO, Zendesk has managed to grow its revenues via rapid product innovation, and I expect the company to continue in a similar fashion over the next decade as it evolves into a complete CRM platform and becomes a multi-billion dollar revenue business.Source: Introducing Zendesk SunshineThe Sunshine Platform is Zendesk's next-gen service-first CRM platform. Sunshine enables businesses to get a holistic view of a customer with varied data points like customer interactions, user profiles (multiple channels), and custom objects/assets all accessible through a single application. This platform can provide superior customer experience compared to legacy CRM solutions for several use-cases like onboarding, order management, IoT applications etc. Here's a must watch demo of Sunshine:Source: Zendesk Sunshine DemoA more comprehensive demo of Sunshine's offering is available here. For now, let's learn more about the platform and how some of its customers are using it directly from Mikkel Svane (Zendesk's co-founder and CEO):Source: Zendesk CEO on Sunshine CRM platform launch, future of messagingNow, I hope you can see the value that Sunshine is bringing to Zendesk's customers. However, we must analyze what Sunshine could do for Zendesk.According to Zendesk's management, Sunshine could have boosted Zendesk's 2019 ARR by 15-40% if the platform was monetized at the time. However, as we know, Sunshine was still in Beta in 2019, and only became generally available in March 2020. Hence, we should see an uplift in Zendesk's revenues due to Sunshine going forward.Also, just 2500 of Zendesk's 160,000+ user base tried the Sunshine platform. Hence, the opportunity for broader adoption of Sunshine among Zendesk's customers shall serve as a critical driver of growth.Source: Zendesk Investor Day CFO PresentationOther than Sunshine, Zendesk has a lot of revenue upside from additional features/products like Talk, Chat, Guide, Messaging, Explore, Sell, Answer Bot (AI/ML), and Sunshine Conversations. Zendesk estimates that with its new multiproduct and platform approach, it could yield 3.5x of support revenues via additional products.Source: Zendesk Investor Day CFO PresentationZendesk's offering has come a long way and evolved into a compelling service-first CRM solution. However, the CRM software market is a highly competitive arena with long-reigning heavyweights like Salesforce (CRM), SAP (SAP), and Oracle (ORCL). So, let's assess Zendesk's market opportunity and gauge its market position.Source: Zendesk Investor Day CFO PresentationAccording to Zendesk's self-estimation (using IDC projections), it could have a total addressable market opportunity of more than $25 billion by 2023. Moreover, Zendesk could very well enter into adjacent markets through product innovation to expand its TAM further. Furthermore, all of these four markets are still growing, albeit at varying rates. The enterprise digital transformation shall continue to increase demand for CRM products as businesses reinvest some of the cost-benefits of going digital back into enriching their customer's experience.Source: appsruntheworld.comAs per this report, the global cloud CRM application market grew by 17.5% in 2019 to $25.5 billion. In terms of market share, Zendesk contributed only 3% of the total market; however, that gave Zendesk the sixth-largest share in a market dominated by Salesforce and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Zendesk's position also signifies the fragmented nature of the CRM software market, and I believe that new-age companies like Zendesk and HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) do have the potential to compete for higher market share with companies like Salesforce.Source: zendesk.comZendesk's position as a leader in Gartner's 2020 Magic Quadrant for the CRM Customer Engagement Center solidifies my belief that Zendesk could win a higher market share despite operating in a challenging market.Source: Zendesk Investor Day CEO PresentationSo far, in this article, we have seen why Zendesk's future looks bright. To recap, Zendesk is expanding its TAM through rapid product innovation, and demand for its solutions is strong among both enterprise and SMB clients.Now, let's turn our attention from the future to the present, which has many Zendesk investors worried about potential share price decline.Zendesk is well-positioned for long-term growth; however, the global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected Zendesk's business in the first half of 2020, and it is now expected to roll into the next quarter too. As consumer demand dropped off in several industries like airlines, travel, and hospitality, Zendesk's customers cut back on spending. This demand problem accelerated Zendesk's growth deceleration trend that started in the second half of 2019.Source: Created By Author Using Data From YChartsNow, this sharp deceleration is scary for Zendesk's shareholders as the stock is priced for high growth rates. Additionally, Zendesk's management expects the near-term pain to continue for the rest of 2020. The mid-range of revenue guidance ($252.5 million) for Q3 indicates y/y growth of only 20%. This figure represents another sharp drop off in revenue growth rates. Any further slowdown could affect the stock price negatively. However, the long-term story remains intact, and Zendesk's performance should improve with macro-economic recovery. I would like to point out that near-term earnings could lead to significant sell-offs, but long-term investors should utilize those events as buying opportunities.Source: Zendesk Q2 2020 Shareholder LetterSource: Zendesk Q2 2020 Shareholder LetterHistorically, Zendesk's Net retention rate has remained above 115%. However, in Q2 2020, the NRR declined to ~111%. Now, this figure shows that Zendesk is unable to extract much higher revenues from its existing customers, even with the full launch of Sunshine. Thus, I believe that Zendesk's customer base is under severe pressure due to the coronavirus pandemic.Source: Zendesk Q2 2020 Shareholder LetterNow, we know that Zendesk's primary customer base is made up of small-medium sized businesses and weakness from that segment was more or less expected. However, the RPO figure (a proxy for large customers) was also disappointing. During the earnings call, Zendesk's management attributed this slowdown to conservatism from large enterprises in the face of an uncertain economic environment and simultaneously expressed optimism for the large enterprise segment in Q3 and beyond.In this section, we will dissect the long-term trends in Zendesk's financial statements to decipher the strength of its underlying business. Let's start with a study of revenue and margin profile.As you can see in the chart below, Zendesk's revenue has grown from $184.66 million to $924.49 million at ~38% CAGR. During the same period, Zendesk's gross margins have improved by 800 basis points from ~67% to ~75%. Further, operating margins went up from -34% to -12% (nearing breakeven). This metric shows that Zendesk's operational performance is improving with scale.Source: YChartsAccording to estimates from YCharts, Zendesk is expected to grow its revenue to $1590 million by 2022 at a CAGR of ~25% for the next two years.Source: YChartsAs we discussed earlier in this article, Zendesk is operating in a vast market and simultaneously expanding into adjacent markets with product innovation. Moreover, Zendesk has multiple growth drivers like wider adoption of Sunshine, higher penetration of the Enterprise market, the potential to leverage a growing partner ecosystem, and a rise in international markets.Source: Zendesk Investor Day CFO PresentationHence, Zendesk could surely become a multibillion-dollar revenue company by 2030. In fact, my revenue projections set 2030 forward revenues at $5 billion, which would indicate a CAGR of ~17% for the next decade.Now let's assess Zendesk's balance sheet to analyze its financial stability.Source: YChartsAt the end of last quarter, Zendesk had cash and equivalents of $700 million and financial debt of $1043 million. We can see that Zendesk has a negative EBITDA of $103.29 million, which means the company is losing money. Furthermore, Zendesk's business operations do not adequately cover the interest expense of $11.99 million. Now, such a financial situation is commonplace for high-growth software companies, but investors must not disregard the possibility of shareholder dilution.For the last twelve-month period, Zendesk reported a cash burn of ~$52.59 million, with the previous two quarters pushing FCF from neutral to negative. However, Zendesk's management attributed negative FCF to delay in collections and a 30-day adjustment in cadence. Thus, I expect Zendesk's FCF to return to a neutral or slightly positive state in the upcoming quarters.Source: YChartsZendesk's robust cash position represents adequate growth capital, and I think the recent debt raise should allay fears of a cash burn out. However, to compensate for any potential shareholder dilutions (due to SBC), I will assume a 20% dilution in my stock valuation process.To estimate Zendesk's intrinsic value, I will leverage my proprietary valuation model, with which many of you are already familiar. For those of you who have not yet seen it, here's what it entails:Now, let's check out Zendesk's intrinsic value:Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelAs can be seen above, Zendesk is undervalued according to a rather conservative discounted cash flow model. Considering the company just grew at about 27% during an absolutely vicious recession, and considering the company is projecting 27% growth annually for the next few years, 22% average annualized growth is reasonable, if not conservative.Furthermore, I used a long-term free cash flow margin of 35% and shares outstanding of 115M. I diluted those 115M another 25% over the coming decade to account for stock based compensation that will likely not get mopped up by excess cash (excess cash will likely go into growth initiatives).Even with this level of conservatism, the stock still makes a great deal of sense today, as I will further demonstrate in the next section.To determine the expected returns, the LASV model calculates a projected FCF per share value by year ten (grown at the assumed rate in the DCF portion of the model, i.e., 22%) and multiplies it with an assumed Price to FCF multiple (35x here), thereby generating a 2030 price target. Using this price target, the model further deduces an expected CAGR return.Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelAs can be seen above, Zendesk offers very compelling returns of about 17%, and this is based on rather conservative assumptions for growth, which I very much expect Zendesk to achieve under the leadership of its original, visionary founder.Here are some of the most significant risks to Zendesk:Zendesk's customer engagement software solutions unify various communication channels into a single application. Thus, agents and customer service executives can leverage Zendesk to provide a better experience to their consumers. Zendesk's CX solutions are well-received and trusted by more than 160,000 businesses (up from ~125k a year ago). The San Francisco-based CRM-software company has a history of product innovation, and its latest product, 'Sunshine' will very likely continue to supercharge growth going forward.For now, the macro-economic environment is weighing heavily on Zendesk's business (evidenced by the rapid deceleration in its net retention rate). However, the long-term story remains strong, and I expect growth to return to higher levels once the macro-economic environment improves.The stock is currently trading at a discount to its intrinsic value and offers potential double-digit returns. Hence, I am bullish on Zendesk.As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow for more, and happy investing!"

The company's revenue has grown at a CAGR of 33.11% in the last five years. The company has a few strong growth drivers which will help grow its revenue in the next five years. However, in the near-term the company's stock is fully valued. Long-term investors can buy the stock during pullbacks.Zendesk is a CRM (customer relationship management) company, that primarily offers its clients customer engagement software. The company provides organizations of all sizes the ability to deliver a transparent and responsive customer experience. The company's flexible CRM platform is built on public cloud technologies and open standards. The company integrates machine learning and artificial intelligence with its solutions, so that its clients can be efficient and proactive with their customers.Source: The Blue Diamond GalleryZendesk Support and Zendesk TalkZendesk Support, Zendesk's flagship product, offers help desk tools to clients' customer support agents. It is used to track, prioritize and solve customer support tickets, bringing customer support interactions in one place. It ensures communication between agents and customers is personal and efficient. Zendesk Support allows clients to customize their support, and with it, agents give customers quick and easy resolutions to their issues.Zendesk Talk, a cloud-based call center solution, offers phone and short message service support conversations to clients' customers. Zendesk Talk is embedded in the Zendesk Support ticketing system. Together, Zendesk Support and Zendesk Talk offer an efficient and a reliable contact center solution. According to a report:I believe Zendesk's revenue from Zendesk Support and Zendesk Talk will also grow at a similar rate. Since these products are flexible and can be configured according to the preferences of Zendesk's clients, the adoption of these products will rise. With cloud-hosted and web-based contact center solutions becoming very popular, the demand for Zendesk's contact center solution will increase significantly in the long-term.Zendesk GuideZendesk Guide is a customer self-service software. It helps clients create a knowledge base which offers customer self-service. The knowledge base content is created by Zendesk's clients, and is available through self-service websites. The content is created by organizing frequently asked questions, product details, policies, and more. Within Guide, there is an Answer Bot, which uses machine learning to answer customers' questions. According to a report:I believe Zendesk's revenue from Zendesk Guide will also grow at a similar rate. The company offers powerful software to create and handle knowledge base content. The software offers a WYSIWYG editor to create the knowledge base. Creating a well-stocked knowledge base is a fast and intuitive process with Zendesk Guide and therefore it will see rising demand.Zendesk's first quarter 2020 revenue came in at $237.5 million, an increase of 31% over the year-ago period. GAAP net loss for the quarter came in at $42.8 million, compared to $44.7 million in the year-ago period, and GAAP net loss per share for the quarter was $0.38, compared to $0.41 in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $12.4 million, compared to $5.1 million in the year-ago period, and non-GAAP net income per share for the quarter was $0.11, compared to $0.05 in the year-ago period.The company delivered good results amid a challenging quarter. The company's financial results were not significantly impacted by COVID-19 during the initial phase of the pandemic. However, some of Zendesk's clients will see revenue contraction in the coming quarters, such as airlines, retail, and travel and hospitality companies. As a result, I expect Zendesk will see a slowdown in revenue growth in the coming quarters. Zendesk's stock is richly valued, and if investors wait, I believe they will get a better entry point to buy the stock.The customer engagement software (help desk, ticketing and CRM software) market is highly competitive. In addition, this market is fragmented and rapidly evolving. Zendesk's competitors in this market include Salesforce (CRM), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT) and ServiceNow (NOW). These competitors have greater financial resources and operational flexibility, so that they can bundle competing products and services with other products. As a result, Zendesk's solutions could see lower demand. The competitors can also offer lower prices for their products, which could negatively impact Zendesk's competitiveness.Zendesk's competitive advantage is that it is continuously developing new products. Although its main product is help desk and ticketing software, it has developed a CRM platform to grab market share of Salesforce and other competitors. Zendesk receives positive customer reviews for its customer support tools, and I believe the company will continue to develop new and innovative products in the areas of customer support and CRM. As a result, its revenue will continue to grow.Zendesk's most similar peers include Salesforce, Oracle, Microsoft and ServiceNow. Zendesk's non-GAAP forward PE multiple is 210.69x, compared to Salesforce's 63.73x, Oracle's 13.73x, Microsoft's 31.32x and ServiceNow's 100.44x. Zendesk's trailing twelve months price to sales multiple is 12.07x, compared to Salesforce's 8.90x, Oracle's 4.57x, Microsoft's 10.71x and ServiceNow's 21.56x. Zendesk's trailing twelve months price to cash flow multiple is 158.84x, compared to Salesforce's 40.20x, Oracle's 13.00x, Microsoft's 25.12x and ServiceNow's 59.33x.Zendesk is richly valued compared to its peers. It has an okay balance sheet consisting of $468.10 million of cash and $597.80 million of debt. Zendesk is richly valued because of its growing portfolio of products. In the last five years the company's revenue has grown at a CAGR of 33.11%, which is very impressive. The company's contact center and customer self-service software products are high growth products. Global revenues from these products will grow around a CAGR of 20% in the long-term. Since these products are Zendesk's main products, I believe the company's overall revenue will grow at a CAGR of high-teens in the next five years.Zendesk's revenue on trailing twelve months basis is $872.4 million. Assuming that revenue will grow at a CAGR of 18%, the company's mid-2025 revenue will be $1,996 million or $17.47 per share. In the last five years the company's shares have traded between the price to sales multiples of 6x and 15x. Applying a price to sales multiple of 15x on the company's mid-2025 revenue per share, I get $262.05 as the company's mid-2025 share price. Currently, the stock is trading around $95, and it has meaningful upside left in the long-term. However, in the short-term, the stock is fully valued and expected to stay in a range. Long-term investors can buy the stock during pullbacks.For attracting new customers and increasing revenue from existing customers, Zendesk must be able to improve or enhance its existing product and platform solutions and introduce new solutions in a timely manner. For growing its business, Zendesk must be able to expand its solutions beyond customer service to other areas of relationships between organizations and their customers. If the company cannot do these, its revenue growth could be negatively impacted.Zendesk's product and platform solutions are integrated into a diverse range of technology environments and specialized use cases. The company's future success will depend on such integration. In many cases, the company assists its customers in integrating its solutions with their technology, and in other cases the customers themselves integrate the solutions. If the company or its customers are unable to integrate the solutions successfully, customers' perceptions about Zendesk's solutions could be impaired and they may choose not to use Zendesk's product and platform solutions.Zendesk's business is a fundamentally strong business and its customer base is diverse and resilient. Although I expect the COVID-19 pandemic will result in slowdown in the company's revenue growth in the coming quarters, the extent of the slowdown will not be significant, as computer software and e-commerce companies will support revenue growth. As far as the stock is concerned, currently the risk-reward ratio is skewed towards risk, but in the long-term the stock has significant upside left from the current level."
4354122,21798,2020-06-16T13:16:48-04:00,"Zendesk is expected to grow revenue and earnings at a strong double-digit rate this year and beyond.Zendesk's easy-to-use platform led many high-profile customers to become subscribers.The valuation is currently lofty, so investors should have patience before starting a new position.","Zendesk (ZEN) is a company that offers customer relationship management [CRM] solutions to other companies. Zendesk provides a software-as-a-service [SaaS] subscription format, which allows for recurring revenue.Zendesk has compelling above-average growth. However, the stock reached a high valuation level. It would probably be better for investors to be patient and wait for a pullback in the stock. The stock can be placed on a watch list for a better entry point.The company attracted many well-known customers such as Shopify (SHOP), Uber (UBER), Coursera, Venmo (PYPL), Ingersoll Rand (IR), Tesco (OTCQX:TSCDY), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK), and others. Zendesk's solutions give businesses CRM solutions to grow and maintain customer relationships. This includes the integration of phone, email, chat, and messenger. It also involves tracking and solving customer support issues. This enables its subscribers to focus on their core operations while Zendesk handles the CRM aspects of their businesses.Seeking Alpha has ratings based on quant fundamentals, SA author ratings, and Wall Street analysts' ratings. It is good to look at all three aspects since you get a combination of crowd-sourced perspectives along with objective fundamental measures.source: Seeking AlphaThe objective quant ratings shown above are indicating an overall neutral rating. This is mostly because of the stock's high valuation, which currently has a D- rating. The company's growth is excellent, but investors would be paying a lot for that growth with a high valuation.The neutral SA author ratings reflect concerns about valuation and uncertainties regarding not providing earnings guidance for 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 implications.The Wall St. analyst rating remains bullish. Within the last 30 days, there have been 16 buy ratings from analysts with 4 hold ratings and no sell ratings. They must be focused primarily on Zendesk's growth without much concern for the high valuation.Zendesk remains important even amidst the uncertainties of the COVID-19 virus. The reason for that is because Zendesk's clients need to maintain strong customer service to keep their customers abreast of how their services are adapting to the COVID-19 situation.Zendesk's solutions have the ability to deliver fast results to get value to customers. This means that Zendesk's subscribers are able to operate CRM functions more efficiently. These efficiencies lead to reduced costs for Zendesk's customers. Cost reduction is a good selling point that benefits businesses that help attract new subscribers.Zendesk's solutions work well during the COVID-19 situation. The CRM experiences align with social distancing measures. CRM functions such as chat, messaging, email, and phone calls are done remotely without person-to-person contact.Of course, Zendesk's solutions also work well outside of pandemic situations. Zendesk's CRM solutions are easy to use and provide key insights through analytics. These insights help Zendesk's subscribers to gain a good understanding of their customers.Zendesk's solutions are customizable. Zendesk offers solutions for businesses of all sizes with price ranges based on how much support is needed. Therefore, companies can devise CRM strategies that are the most relevant to their businesses and continue to customize it and scale up over time as needed.Zendesk's most attractive aspect as a potential investment is high above-average revenue growth. Revenue increased by 36% in 2019 over 2018. While the growth rate for 2020 might be negatively impacted by COVID-19, Zendesk is still expected to achieve a high revenue increase of 23% to 24% this year (consensus). The company is showing that it is still able to gain customers and new revenue during these uncertain times.The other important thing about Zendesk's growth is that the company may turn a profit in 2020. Net income has been negative for many years. However, increases in the gross margin are helping to drive profitability going forward. Zendesk's trailing twelve months [TTM] gross margin increased to 72.7% over the 5-year average of 69.5% and 2019's GM of 71% and 2018's GM of 69.7%.The operating expenses have been higher than the gross margin in previous years. This has been the result of high SG&A and R&D expenses. The good news is that the SG&A and R&D expenses have been trending down over the past five years. So, the increases in GM and decreases in SG&A and R&D expenses could lead to the positive net income in 2020. That depends on how well Zendesk's business performs in the second half of the year.Even if Zendesk doesn't achieve profitability in 2020, the company's strong revenue growth and effective management of expenses should lead to turning a profit soon.Zendesk's disadvantage as a potential investment is its high overvaluation. The stock is trading with a lofty triple-digit forward PE of 180 and a high PEG ratio of over 4. Since the company is just turning a profit, the price to sales ratio can be a helpful valuation measure. Even the price to sales ratio shows an overvaluation at 9 TTM.For context, the S&P 500's trailing price to sales ratio is 2.15. Zendesk's price to sales ratio is over 3x higher. Having a price to sales ratio in the low to mid-single digits would show a more attractive valuation.I typically like to see forward PE ratios in the average to the slightly above-average range for high-growth companies. Zendesk's forward PE ratio is probably skewed high because they are just on the verge of profitability. The PEG ratio is way too high. The high growth companies that I cover whose stocks perform well typically have PEG ratios below 2. So, the stock needs a pullback for a more reasonable valuation level.source: stockcharts.comThe stock did reach a near overbought level on the RSI about a few weeks ago. It's not clear if the pullback this week will be similar to the mini-pullbacks that the stock experienced over the past few months. The MACD line just crossed below the red signal line, indicating that the trend is changing from positive to negative. Money flow [CMF] declined so far in June. So, it is possible this is just the beginning of a larger pullback for the stock.The largest risk for Zendesk is competition. There are many companies of various sizes in the market offering similar services. So, Zendesk's future will depend on how well the company can grow in the face of this competition.There should be plenty of demand for Zendesk's services. The global CRM market is expected to grow at about 15% annually to 2025. This provides a good tailwind for multiple players to benefit in the CRM market.So far, Zendesk dominated the market share in the CRM market. The company has a market share of 42.5% according to Datanyze. This is calculated by taking the total websites using Zendesk's technology divided by the total amount of websites using similar technology in the market. The next highest competitor, Freshdesk has a market share of about 5.8%.If Zendesk continues its growth momentum in the market while staving off the competition, the company can continue to grow revenue at a strong above-average pace. The problem with the stock is the high valuation. It would be wise to wait for a better entry point after the stock becomes oversold. This can happen on a significant pullback or the next market correction."
4349034,104608,2020-05-20T13:11:47-04:00,"Zendesk reported Q1 revenue and EPS that were ahead of expectations; however, cash flow seemed to be the weak point.Management did not provide 2020 guidance, though Q2 guidance implies revenue growth of only 24%, decelerating from 31% in Q1.With the stock currently trading over $70, I believe valuation at ~7x 2021 revenue seems a bit aggressive and remain on the sidelines for now.","Zendesk (ZEN) is one of the leaders in delivery enterprise software for customer support services. The company reported another strong quarter with revenue and margins slightly ahead of expectations. However, the company declined to provide updated 2020 guidance given the uncertainties in the market and their Q2 revenue guidance implies only ~22-24% growth, which would be quite a bit of deceleration from the 31% growth seen in Q1.During the quarter, the company also expanded gross and operating margins which seemed to be better than what investors expected. However, the company guided Q2 to an operating loss likely due to increased expenses related to shifting employees to a work-from-home model in addition to losing some revenue as clients pull back and reduce their capital expenditures.Data by YChartsAt one point, the stock was down ~40% as the market was in the correction phase given the uncertainty around the global pandemic. The stock started to recover over the ensuing weeks; however, after reporting Q1 earnings, the stock went down over 5%. I believe investors became less concerned about management not providing 2020 guidance and more concerned about Q2 expectations and weaker than expected cash flow during Q1.Even though the company has a history of beating expectations, the current economic conditions make it very difficult to deliver proper guidance as uncertainty remains looming throughout the market. In addition, valuation remains a little elevated at ~7x 2021 revenue. The company may continue to see lower revenue growth than previously expected, which could impair their revenue multiple over the long term.While I like the stock over the long term, I remain on the sidelines for now and will wait for a better entry point, which could happen if the stock trades closer to $60-65.Revenue during the quarter remained pretty strong, growing 31% to $237.5 million, which was above expectations by ~$1 million and was near the lower end of management’s previous guidance range of $237-242 million. The company does benefit by having their revenue driven by subscriptions, which means even if their clients’ volumes have suffered due to the global pandemic, as long as they continue to use ZEN, they will earn revenue.Source: Company PresentationOne area of strength during the quarter was the company’s margins. Gross margins during the quarter remained strong at 78%, up from 73% in the year ago period. Given the company’s software subscription model, they are poised to continue margin expansion over time. In addition, the improved gross margins fell directly down through improved operating margins, which came in at 4% during the quarter, up from 0% in the year ago period. The gross margin expansion enabled the company to continue investing in S&M and R&D without needing to lower operating expenses in order to expand margins.Source: Company PresentationAs the company continues to scale, I believe we could see margins continue to expand and remain healthy. With revenue coming in slightly ahead of expectations and margins expanding nicely during the quarter, this led to EPS of $0.11, which was better than the $0.06 expectations.However, the one bigger concern for the quarter was cash flow. Even though margins showed some strength during the quarter, operating cash flow came in at -$2.6 million loss, well below the $19.0 million recorded in the year ago period. A majority of this decline was likely related to changes in the company’s billings policy, which aimed at giving their clients more flexibility on renewals. ZEN started to invoice their clients on renewal dates, rather than one month prior, thus, leaving a month delay between potential collection of cash flows.While it is difficult to know if cash flows will be impacted over the long term, by not renewing client contracts earlier, this gives the clients more flexibility during the pandemic in order to right-size their services with ZEN. I believe investors will look closely at cash flow metrics during Q2 and for the remainder of the year in order to determine if the new flexible policy can still generate strong cash flows.Source: Company PresentationNot surprisingly, the company declined to provide updated 2020 guidance given the uncertainty regarding the global pandemic. Rather than estimating where they could end up nine months from now, many companies are finding out how murky forecasting guidance has become during these challenging economic times.However, ZEN did provide guidance for Q2, which includes revenue of $237-243 million, representing growth of ~22-24% compared to the year ago period, which would be a significant deceleration from the 31% growth seen during Q1. At the beginning of the year, management noted they expect growth of ~30% for the full year, which means the lowered guidance implies nearly 25-30% of their original revenue is missing from Q2. In addition, non-GAAP operating income loss is expected to be $8-12 million, which would mean margins getting worse sequentially compared to the 4% seen in Q1.After reporting earnings two weeks ago, the stock initially dropped over 6% but has since recovered a little bit. Like many other technology stocks in the market, ZEN was down nearly 40% once the fear of the global pandemic fully hit the market, though has slowly recovered since and remains down ~20%.ZEN is known as being one of the leaders of enterprise software for customer support services, an area of IT where spending is not likely to drastically slow down in the coming years due to enterprises placing more emphasis on the customer experience. I believe over the long term, ZEN is a great name to own, though there may be some heightened concerns in the near term as the company helps their clients navigate these challenging economic times.Data by YChartsZEN has a current market cap of ~$8.4 billion, and with ~$850 million of cash and ~$490 million of debt, the company has an enterprise value of ~$8.05 billion. If we were to use management’s original 2020 revenue guidance of $1,050-1,070 million, this would result in a 2020 revenue multiple of ~7.6x. However, with full-year guidance withdrawn and Q2 guidance only implying growth of ~23%, investors should not rely on that methodology.Over time as the pandemic passes and normal economic activity resumes, ZEN could see their revenue growth accelerate back closer to 30%; however, in the current environment, this does not seem feasible. Assuming revenue growth remains somewhat muted for the rest of the year, we could see growth come in closer to 25%, which would imply ~$1,020 million of 2020 revenue, which implies a revenue multiple of ~8x.Even assuming further deceleration in 2021 revenue growth to 20% could lead to 2021 revenue of $1.20 billion, resulting in a 2021 revenue multiple ~6.7x. At these levels, I believe the stock could be fully priced for a stronger than expected 2020 on top of re-acceleration in 2021. For perspective, 2021 revenue would have to be closer to $1.6 billion in order to imply a more reasonable 2021 revenue multiple of ~5x.For now, I remain on the sidelines given valuation remains a bit high and the uncertainty regarding cash flow challenges during the recent quarter. While I believe the stock will continue to show strong growth over the next few years, I believe investors should have some caution building positions in higher-valued names.Risks to ZEN include continued global economic uncertainties which could impact the company’s revenue growth and consistency. If revenue growth decelerates and remains depressed over the next several quarters or years, this would place increased pressure on margins and cash flow, which could impact the company’s ability to operate effectively. In addition, along with many other software names, the company trades off a high forward revenue multiple, which could contract quickly if we were to experience another market correction."
4370517,104608,2020-08-24T18:36:21-04:00,"Zendesk reported a better than expected Q2 with revenue growth, margins, and EPS all coming in nicely above expectations.The big concern on the quarter was Q3 revenue guidance coming in slightly below expectations due to continued customer churn and small/medium-sized business concerns.Valuation has come down to only ~7.8x 2021 revenue and appears to be an attractive entry point with the stock now trading around $88.","Zendesk (ZEN) is one of the leaders in delivery enterprise software for customer support services. The company recently reported a very strong Q2, with revenue coming in above expectations and guidance in addition to operating margins showing strong expansion. Despite the challenging economic conditions, the company's software subscription revenue has protected the downside to revenue growth.The stock has been weak since the company reported earnings, largely due to Q3 guidance of $250-255 million coming in below expectations for ~$256 million. Over the past few quarters, the company's customer churn has increased, which could seem to imply that near-term revenue growth could be impacted, which is a serious concern. However, the longer-term prospects remain healthy and investors should continue to be excited about the company's long-term horizon.Data by YChartsSince the company reported earnings, the stock has been down ~14%. With Q3 revenue guidance coming in below expectations is of concern, the company's software subscription revenue should provide the company with enough visibility to remain confident in their quarterly guidance. In addition, there was likely some conservatism baked into the numbers and we could, ultimately, see revenue upside to the quarter if the global economy continues to improve. As the economy improves and consumers and enterprises purchase more products and services, there could be an increased demand for customer support services, which could become a tailwind to ZEN's operations.Given the recent pullback in the stock, valuation has come down to a reasonable ~7.8x 2021 revenue. Over the past year, the stock has typically traded between a 9x and 11x forward revenue, and while the ~7.8x 2021 revenue is slightly more forward-looking than forward revenue, the valuation seems to remain attractive.I continue to like the stock long term given the revenue growth prospects as consumers and enterprises return to their pre-pandemic spending levels. In addition, the company continues to expand its operating margins and this margin improvement is likely to continue for several more years. With the stock now trading ~$88, I believe long-term investors should look to add this high-growth name to their portfolio.Even though the Q2 quarter was more challenging in terms of macroeconomic conditions, the company continued on its strong growth path, growing revenue 27% to $246.7 million, which was nicely above expectations for only $240 million and above management's guidance range of $237-243 million. Given the highly recurring nature of subscription revenue, it was not surprising to see revenue remain strong and ahead of expectations. As long as their clients remained in business and continued to use ZEN's products, ZEN will still generate sufficient revenue.Source: Company PresentationGross margin remained impressive during the quarter, coming in at ~78.2%, well above the year-ago period gross margin of ~74.6%. Software revenue tends to come with a higher gross margin as there are limited expenses related to the production of revenue.Over time, as the company scales and is better able to leverage its fixed operating expenses over a larger revenue base, the operating margin will also expand. This was somewhat evident in Q2 as operating margins expanded to 7.8%, up from only 2.0% in the year-ago period.Source: Company PresentationGiven the better than expected revenue combined with strong operating margin expansion during the quarter, non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.14, well above expectations for only $0.04.Even though the non-GAAP operating margin and earnings are improving, the company has struggled with cash flow this year. During Q2, free cash flow was -$20.9 million, bringing the year-to-date total free cash flow of -$36.5 million. While some of this impact is likely related to changes in the company's billing policy, the investor will take free cash flow metrics into consideration when looking at valuation.As a brief reminder, the company recently changed its billings policy, which aimed at giving clients increased renewal flexibility. ZEN began invoicing clients on their renewal dates, rather than the month prior to renewal, thus, leaving a month delay between potential cash flow collection.Source: Company PresentationWhile the company continued to not provide 2020 guidance given the economic uncertainties stemming from the global pandemic, the company did provide Q3 guidance.Revenue for Q3 is expected to be $250-255 million, which was slightly below expectations for ~$256 million. I believe this is one of the bigger reasons as to why the company's stock has gone down since they reported earnings. Non-GAAP operating income (loss) is expected to be $10-14 million or ~4.7% margin at the midpoint. While I believe management could be slightly conservative around their quarterly guidance, the guide was not strong and came in below already tempered expectations.Since reporting earnings, the stock has dropped some 14%. The biggest reason for this drop is likely due to Q3 quarterly revenue guidance coming in below expectations, which were already low given the uncertain economic environment. The lower revenue guidance could be a combination of some conservatism and higher customer churn, especially in the small/medium-sized business category.Given the small/medium-sized businesses have been hardest hit during the economic recession, it is not surprising that these companies are looking for ways to reduce expenses in order to keep the lights on. While these customers may eventually return over time, the higher churn does bring near-term revenue growth into question.ZEN is a leader of enterprise software for customer support services, an area of IT where spending will likely increase over the next several years once we get past the global pandemic. As enterprises place more emphasis on the customer experience, companies will be encouraged to spend more on services such as those that ZEN provides. Over the long term, there is a lot to remain bullish about, even if customer experience spending, and ZEN's revenue, as a result, takes a hit in the near term.Data by YChartsZEN has a current market cap of ~$10.15 billion, and with ~$900 million of cash and ~$1,050 million of debt, the company has an enterprise value of ~$10.3 billion. So far, revenue growth during this year has decelerated a little bit, which was a likely result due to the global pandemic. However, I believe revenue growth has held up better than feared, which is why the stock remains positive year-to-date.However, investors should start to look at 2021 and 2022 revenue to better understand valuation. At the end of 2019, the company generated ~$816 million of revenue. Assuming revenue growth for 2020 comes in at ~25%, which would assume further deterioration in Q3 and Q4, we could see 2020 revenue of $1,020, implying a 2020 revenue multiple of ~10.1x.Considering we are only a few months from 2021 beginning, investors should focus more on the out-year. As the pandemic slowly runs its course and normal economic activity can be seen in the future, revenue growth could accelerate back closer to 30%. This could occur if enterprises resume their IT spending activities related to customer support solutions. Customer experience will continue to be a valuable area of the enterprise-consumer relationship, and enterprises may need to increase their spending in order to draw in new consumers. This could leave us with 2021 revenue of ~$1,325 million, implying a 2021 revenue multiple of ~7.8xGiven where valuation currently stands when looking at 2021 revenue, I believe long-term investors should be compelled to build up a position in this name. Even with heightened fears around Q3 revenue guidance coming in below expectations, I find it challenging to see the stock trade below $80, as valuation would reach a multiple closer to 7x, below the company's historical trading range as per the chart above.Risks to ZEN include continued global economic uncertainties which could impact the company's revenue growth and consistency. If revenue growth decelerates and remains depressed over the next several quarters or years, this would place increased pressure on margins and cash flow, which could impact the company's ability to operate effectively. Given the company is still growing quickly and investing heavily in their operations, cash flow generation is an important determining factor for future growth. ZEN also has small/medium-sized customers which could be facing increased pressures due to the global pandemic constraining supply chains. These smaller companies may be faced with increased pressures compared to larger enterprises. If ZEN's smaller customer base is not able to recover from the pandemic at a similar pace as larger enterprises, ZEN may see their revenue growth slow down over the next several quarters and potentially the next few years. In addition, along with many other software names, the company trades off a high forward revenue multiple, which could contract quickly if we were to experience another market correction."

        The company has noted encouraging recovery trends, however, on top of profit expansion.","Since the coronavirus began, it has been exceedingly rare for a technology company - much less an enterprise software company, which has been among the hottest sectors to be invested in among the remote-work push - to fall post-earnings. Zendesk (ZEN) is one of the few exceptions. Having now been a ""penalty box"" software stock for about a year ever since the company announced growing pains and sales execution issues, Zendesk shares gave back ~10% of its recent rally after the company reported Q2 results and issued lackluster guidance.The problem, of course, is that Zendesk is in the wrong area of enterprise software. With its products dealing primarily with customer-support and sales people (through its newer CRM modules), Zendesk's end-users are exactly the personnel that have been on the chopping blocks for many companies looking to slim down headcount and conserve costs. To that end, all CRM/HCM companies have seen a slowdown in growth trends - even as their counterparts that direct support remote work are seeing record results.I retracted my bullish view on Zendesk last quarter, and I remain neutral on the stock though I have a positive view on Zendesk's long-term growth. There are many things to like about Zendesk, and the long-term bullish thesis in this stock still remains intact:In spite of these strengths, I think it's best to wait on the sidelines for Zendesk. Especially with the deceleration that Zendesk is calling for in the third quarter, I think sentiment will weaken for this stock (and overall, I think SaaS stocks are overdue for a correction anyway). Keep an eye out for an entry point in Zendesk at around ~7x forward revenues (~$78, and roughly where Zendesk started the year trading at), but don't rush in to catch the falling knife just yet. We can now turn the discussion to Zendesk's latest results and its dour outlook for the coming quarter. Take a look at the results below:Figure 1. Zendesk Q2 results Source: Zendesk Q2 shareholder letterThe main headline is that Zendesk's revenue growth continued to decelerate, though not as much as expected. Revenues grew 27% y/y to $246.7 million, decelerating from last quarter's 31% y/y growth rate, but beating Wall Street' expectations of $240.6 million (+24% y/y) by a safe three-point margin as well as its own guidance range of $237-$243 million, or 23% y/y growth at the midpoint. As a sales-oriented software company, and one that also has a large concentration of smaller and midsize clients, this slowdown isn't entirely unexpected. Per CEO Mikkel Svane's commentary on the demand environment for Zendesk's products in Q2, delivered on the Q2 earnings call:In order to retain customers as best as possible, Zendesk has been flexible with customers in allowing them to adjust their contract terms and push out payments, which Zendesk has said affected its near-term net retention rates and cash flows (this, by the way, is not a move all software companies have universally allowed for their clients). The main problem, however, is that Q2 isn't the worst of it for Zendesk - even as many other companies have signaled that Q2 will be the brunt of the pandemic's damage. Zendesk's guidance outlook for Q3 calls for $250-$255 million in revenues (below Wall Street's $255.7 million consensus), and at the top end of that range only representing 21% y/y growth.Figure 2. Zendesk guidanceSource: Zendesk Q2 shareholder letterNow of course, we have learned to always take Zendesk's guidance with a grain of skepticism. In guiding to a maximum of 24% y/y growth in Q2, Zendesk came in at 27% y/y. Still, the fact that Zendesk continues to directionally trend downward is one of the causes for the downward pull on its share price.Nevertheless, the company's profit margin gains during a time of revenue contraction remain solidly encouraging. This is largely due to the fact that A) Zendesk's field sales teams have been grounded and the company isn't hosting expensive customer conferences in the wake of the global pandemic, and B) Zendesk has already started a greater shift toward self-service channels that require lower touch by its sales teams (especially for smaller prospects), which helps to bring down overall sales headcount requirements as the business grows. Zendesk's pro forma operating margins jumped 580bps to 7.8% in Q2, up from just 2.0% in the year-ago quarter. And on a GAAP basis, Zendesk's operating margins improved fourteen points to a near-breakeven -12.8%. It's very rare to see a software company that is still growing in the 20s (albeit decelerating) while also producing strong operating margin gains and getting this close to GAAP breakeven. This balance between growth and profitability is what makes me confident that Zendesk can see multiples expansion in the medium-term future, but in the near term sentiment will likely still weigh against this stock and punish it for its growth deficiencies.Customer service and CRM are still among the largest markets in enterprise software, and even if they're seeing a near-term headwind thanks to the coronavirus crippling global sales teams, Zendesk still has a large growth runway ahead of it. Continue to keep an eye on this stock especially if shares keep falling sideways, but don't rush in too soon as I think the correction ahas further to go."

Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) recently announced its quarterly results that failed to impress the market with its outlook.Zendesk's FinancialsZendesk's first quarter revenues grew 31% to $237.4 million, in line with the market's forecast. GAAP net loss was $36.2 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.10 was ahead with the Street's estimates of $0.06. But the company's outlook dampened the performance.Zendesk withdrew its outlook for the year amidst the current virus concerns. It did provide a current quarter outlook. Revenue for the quarter was forecast at $237-$243 million, falling short of the market's forecast of $245 million. The stock fell 6% in the after-hours session post the result announcement.Zendesk's Enterprise FocusWhile Zendesk has been trying to expand its footprint into the enterprise segment, most of its customers still fall in the small and mid-sized business category. The current crisis has been particularly hard on the SMB segment. Analysts have expressed concerns that Zendesk's customer base will make it more prone to the economic downturn than software providers with larger clients. Zendesk continues to focus on making inroads into the larger organizations. Earlier this year, it announced a strategic alliance with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) as part of this focus. As part of the partnership, Zendesk's support, sales, and engagement software solutions will be integrated with TCS's contextual knowledge and experience in digital transformation. The two companies will work together to help organizations solve for their complex technological requirements while providing CRM custom solutions and integrations.Besides partnerships, Zendesk is also improving its product offering. Earlier this year, it announced its new Support and Sales Suite that expands its service-first CRM solutions by enabling service and sales teams to instantly connect with their customers and have natural conversations across all touchpoints. Zendesk Support Suite will empower businesses to deliver a seamless conversational customer experience. They will be able to get a comprehensive view of the latest conversations so that service agents can deliver personalized interactions with their customers. The new Support Suite includes social messaging channels so that customers can manage conversations on messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.Zendesk does not have a PaaS strategy but operates on integrations with its API-based platform. Its customers can use and build integrations that allow them to store, manage, and connect all of their customer data for further analysis. Recently, it announced a new e-commerce integration that allows organizations to process events such as billing so that they can provide real-time help to end customers.Zendesk's stock is currently trading at $80.18 with a market capitalization of $9.16 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $94.89 in July last year. The recent stock market turbulence had sent the stock falling to a 52-week low of $50.23.Freshworks's FinancialsRival Freshworks is also trying to stay ahead by improving its platform integration. Recently, it announced an integration with Slack (NYSE:WORK) to allow teams and customers to collaborate and communicate more effectively. The integration will allow customers to address the surge in issues by providing a seamless way for agents to respond and resolve inquiries as they will be able to use Slack to collaborate with teammates in other departments instantly.Many had expected Freshworks to go public soon. It recently hired a new CFO Tyler Sloat who was part of the team responsible for taking Zuora (NYSE:ZUO) public. The recent economic conditions may have put a dampener on those plans for the short term, but the company has not published any statement to the effect.Freshworks remains privately held for now having raised $399 million from investors including Sequoia Capital India, Accel, Google, Tiger Global Management, and CapitalG. Its last round of funding was held in November last year when it raised $150 million in a round led by Google at a valuation of $3.5 billion. Recent reports suggest that Freshworks doubled revenues in the past 18 months to pass $200 million in annual sales.Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

Downgrading to neutral.","This article was highlighted for PRO subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.The software sector hasn't exactly seen a clear-cut impact from the coronavirus and shelter-in-place situation. Some remote-work stocks like Zoom (ZM) and digital enablers like Docusign (DOCU) have seen a clear surge in demand, but Zendesk (ZEN) falls into the unfortunate category of serving a segment of the market that is seeing depressed activity. The company's recent Q1 earnings release confirms that Zendesk expects growth to continue slowing throughout the rest of the year, compounding its deceleration woes from last year.Data by YChartsI was a Zendesk bull up until now, especially when management first suggested that its growth rates would start declining last year and the stock sharply came off its ~10x forward revenue multiples. I've suggested previously that ""patience is key"" with Zendesk, but now the company's growth trajectory has been completely rewritten thanks to massive uncertainties in the customer-service world. With recovery timelines unclear, plus the very real possibility that customer-service roles will permanently shrink as companies pull back on operational spending, it becomes difficult to justify even a high single-digit valuation multiple for this stock.At present share prices near $74, Zendesk trades at a market cap of $8.39 billion. After netting out the $837.2 million of cash and $490.0 million of convertible debt on Zendesk's current balance sheet, the company is left with an enterprise value of $8.04 billion. Now, against Zendesk's original FY20 guidance outlook of $1.05-$1.07 billion (+30% y/y), that represents a 7.6x EV/FY20 revenue multiple. But with Zendesk yanking that full-year outlook and instead saying growth will decelerate to 23% y/y in Q2, a 30% y/y growth scenario for the full year is looking fairly unlikely, suggesting that Zendesk is trading somewhere in the mid-8s instead. Regardless, it becomes difficult to justify this valuation for a ~20% growth stock when several other comps in the same 20-30% growth bucket (Pluralsight (PS) and Mimecast (MIME) come to mind) trade 2-3 turns lower. I'm revising my stance on Zendesk to neutral; the company has become a wait-and-see stock as we expect a few more quarters of fundamental deterioration ahead. Many of the companies and services that we subscribe to have severely curtailed their customer-service options. Virtually every bank will tell you that we'll face ""extremely long wait times"" if we try to call them, directing us to use self-service and online banking portals as much as possible. Hold times at airlines can extend for hours as rafts of people continue to cancel bookings and demand refunds. Call centers across the world have shrunk in size, and some have set up a portion of their employees to handle customer inquiries from home.It's difficult to deny that the customer-service world has shifted. And though Zendesk has recently extended its services to the CRM side (also down thanks to salespeople's current inability to travel), its flagship business relies in its customer support software products, covering everything from call centers to live chat agents. Zendesk prices its software per agent, with its basic package starting at $5/seat. Some of the increases that Zendesk has reported in self-service/chat products may help to offset declines in call center staff, but if Zendesk's clients begin downsizing their total customer-support operations in the wake of the coronavirus as a way to preserve cash, Zendesk's subscriptions will suffer. We can begin to see the impacts of that contraction in the company's Q1 results, shown below:Figure 1. Zendesk 1Q20 resultsSource: Zendesk Q1 earnings releaseRevenues grew 31% y/y to $237.5 million this quarter, slightly beating Wall Street's expectations of $236.6 million (+30% y/y) but decelerating two points relative to 33% y/y in Q4. Zendesk doesn't expect this pain to get better anytime soon, either. Zendesk pulled its full-year outlook, but it did offer a guidance range of $237-$243 million in revenue for Q2. The midpoint of this range would imply just 23% y/y growth - representing eight points of deceleration versus Q1, and a huge gap to the original 30% y/y growth that Zendesk had planned for the year. Figure 2. Zendesk Q2 outlookSource: Zendesk Q1 earnings releaseZendesk gave mixed feedback on the impact of the coronavirus on its top-line growth. While CEO Mikkel Svane has refuted trends of a slowdown in customer service activity and actually points to ""a rise in customer service"" for most of Zendesk's clients, the commentary that CFO Elena Gomez gave on the Q1 earnings call seems to suggest the company doesn't know when the revenue weakness will recover, hence the sour guidance ranges.Aside from growth, the good news is that Zendesk has been on an uptrend on the margin side, which is one of the bullish factors that prevents me from being too negative on the stock. In particular, Zendesk's pro forma operating margins rose four points this quarter to 4%, up from flat in 1Q19, driven by a five-point boost in gross margins. Zendesk does expect further tailwinds to operating margins this year, with the company planning to reduce operating expenses through a slowdown in hiring.Unfortunately, cash flow did suffer in the quarter, with OCF declining to a loss of -$2.6 million versus a cash inflow of $18.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The primary driver of this was a change in Zendesk's billings policy: to give its clients more flexibility, Zendesk has begun invoicing clients on their renewal date instead of its prior practice of invoicing clients 30 days prior to renewal. Beyond the immediate impact of pushing cash flows out by a month, it's possible that the additional time clients have to downsize or cut subscriptions could lead to higher churn.Figure 3. Zendesk cash flow trends Source: Zendesk Q1 earnings releaseAll in all, I view Zendesk's first-quarter update as a mixed bag. The company's improved margin profile helps to advance the bullish argument that as Zendesk's growth slowed down, it would pivot to focus more on profitability and cash flow. But the ultimate impacts and duration of the coronavirus on customer-service are still unknown, and Zendesk's base case now calls for a rapid deceleration in growth from the 30s to the low 20s. As a slower-growing company, it will be very difficult for Zendesk to reclaim the double-digit valuation multiples it enjoyed in 2018 and early 2019. Approach Zendesk with caution."

The company reported another strong quarter with revenue and margins slightly ahead of expectations and management’s guidance. ZEN also guided 2020 revenue slightly above expectations, though operating income seemed to be slightly below expectations. Nevertheless, the stock has not moved too much from the pre-earnings levels.Q4 revenue grew 33% and continues to move forward at a fast pace, despite the company approaching a $1 billion run-rate level. I believe, over time, margins will also continue to expand as the company is able to better leverage their operating expenses. However, in the meantime, investors will continue to look at revenue growth as a way to value the company.Data by YChartsWith management guiding 2020 revenue growth of ~30% at the midpoint, the company continues to remain one of the fastest revenue-growth companies in the software market. Yes, there are companies growing faster, but there are not too many that are doing so at scale.The company has a history of beating expectations so we could ultimately see revenue growth a little above 30% and potentially another 30% growth year in 2021. However, with the stock currently trading at ~9.4x 2020 revenue and ~7.1x 2021 revenue (assuming another strong year of growth), I believe there is limited upside remaining to valuation.While I like the stock over the long-term, I remain on the sidelines for now and will wait for a better entry point.Revenue during the quarter was strong and grew 33% to $229.9 million. Also, revenue came in above expectations for ~$227 million and slightly ahead of management’s guidance of $226-228 million. Even with the company approaching a $1 billion run-rate revenue amount, growth continues to remain very strong and consistently beats expectations.North America revenue grew 34% during the quarter, down from the 41% growth seen last quarter. In addition, growth in APAC decelerated to 33%, down from 35% last quarter. However, EMEA growth was particularly strong at 33%, up from 29% last quarter. Despite the concerns over global economics slowdown, ZEN has been able to push through strongly and has captured continued success in their international markets.Source: Company PresentationBillings growth during the quarter rebounded very nicely, growing 34% to $261 million, much better than the 25% growth seen last quarter. Last quarter, management noted that a few large deals were pushed into Q4, and the acceleration in growth did not disappoint expectations.Source: Company PresentationOnce again, gross margins remained strong and expanded to 77% during the quarter, up from 74% in the year-ago period. I continue to believe that over time, gross margins will remain above the 75% level given the company’s software/subscription operating model, which naturally comes with higher margins. In addition, operating margins expanded to 5% during the quarter, up slightly from 3% in the year-ago period. As the company continues to scale, we should see operating leverage kick in and margins continue to expand.The slight revenue beat combined with operating margin expansion led to EPS of $0.10 during the quarter, which was similar to what consensus had expected.Q1 revenue guidance calls for $237-242 million, representing 31-33% growth, and was slightly above expectations of ~$238 million at the midpoint. Operating income of $5-9 million implies a margin of 3% during the quarter.For the full year, management is expecting revenue of $1,050-1,070 million, which represents 29-31% growth for the year and was pretty close to expectations for ~$1,060 million. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be $43-53 million, which would represent a margin of ~4.5% at the midpoint, but seemed to be slightly below expectations for ~$60 million in operating income. In addition, management provided FCF guidance calls for $40-50 million.Management’s 2020 guidance was pretty close to what expectations were, thus, the stock did not have much of a reaction after the quarter. While initially up ~4-5% after earnings, the stock has since retracted and is down slightly from the pre-earnings level. I believe, over time, the company will be a long-term winner due to their market opportunity and ~30% revenue growth on top of margin expansion.ZEN is known as being one of the leaders of enterprise software for customer support services, an area of IT where spending is not likely to drastically slow down in the coming years due to enterprises placing more emphasis on the customer experience. I believe over the long term, ZEN is a great name to own, even though valuation has approached 10x forward revenue.Data by YChartsZEN has a current market cap of ~$9.75 billion, and with ~$200 million of cash and ~$480 million of debt, the company has an enterprise value of ~$10.0 billion. Using management’s 2020 revenue guidance of $1,050-1,070 million, this results in a 2020 revenue multiple of ~9.4x.While 2020 revenue growth is expected to be ~30%, I believe the company will continue on their historical pattern of beating expectations and is likely to end the year above 30% revenue growth. Nevertheless, we can assume 31% growth in 2020 and some slight deceleration in 2021, given the law of large numbers, which could result in 2021 revenue of nearly $1.4 billion, or ~7.1x 2021 revenue.Even though the current multiple reflects a strong revenue growth trajectory over the next two years, I believe this is very achievable. 2020 revenue guidance was pretty similar to expectations, but the company has a history of raising their guidance throughout the year, which could ultimately push the stock higher.However, the current valuation and the lack of room for much multiple expansion in the near-term, I remain on the sidelines and wait for a better entry point. Yes, the company is deserving of a premium valuation, but at nearly 10x 2020 revenue, there does not seem to be a whole ton of upside remaining.Risks to ZEN include continued global economic uncertainties which could impact the company’s revenue growth and consistency. In addition, along with many other software names, the company trades off a high forward revenue multiple, which could contract quickly if we were to experience a market correction, much like what we saw during the latter half of 2018."

The pandemic is impacting a lot of its 160,000 paid customers across sizes and industries, particularly those in the ride-sharing and travel sectors. We expect a near-term contraction into Q2, which creates a possible entry point for long-term investors to pick up the stock at a bargain. Q1 was a good quarter for Zendesk. The company maintained a+30% top-line growth while the gross margin expanded by ~480 bps to 78%. It also beat the guidance, though shares price was down 5% upon the Q1 earnings call as the market priced in the contraction ahead. Zendesk's Q2 revenue guidance will be below the consensus as ~20% of its customers are in the industries most impacted by COVID-19, such as travel and ride-sharing. Customers in the ride-hailing/transportation industry include Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT), Ola, and Easy Taxi. On the other hand, Zendesk's customers in the travel/hospitality industry include Airbnb, Skyscanner, OpenTable, Lonely Planet, Azerbaijan Airlines, Qatar Airways, and Four Seasons Hotel. Some of these customers are seeing over 70% - 95% contractions in demand, and as a response, Zendesk is moving quickly to manage the crisis by offering them various flexibilities, such as extended payment terms and a one-time discount.(Zendesk's FCF, quarterly. source: stockrow)To reduce further pressure on its customers, Zendesk also implemented a new policy on March 1st to invoice the customers at the renewal date instead of the 30 days prior. This change of timing severely impacted the FCF (Free Cash Flows) for the quarter. The -$15.6 million of FCF in Q1 2020 marked the first time in over four years that Zendesk recorded a negative FCF in a quarter. Within the same period, FCF has steadily improved from -$6.1 million to $15.87 million last quarter in Q4 2019, which was the highest FCF figure Zendesk ever posted in any quarter.We maintain a bullish view on Zendesk and have written about the stock a few times in the past. The company's easy-to-use product, customer-centric culture, and market leadership have made it an attractive growth story with a solid economic moat. Despite the near-term contraction that puts the company on the backfoot, the management has effectively managed the crisis by being very flexible with its customers when it comes to payment terms and pricing. The action taken so far has aligned with the company's vision as an industry leader in the customer experience space. Therefore, we continue to feel optimistic that its great culture will enable stronger wins, retention, and expansion once COVID-19 ends.(source: company's 10-K)Moreover, key metrics have always been strong. By the end of 2020, Revenue will be more than double from that of 3 years ago. Gross margin also consistently expands every year. The current 78% gross margin in Q1 is already ~1,000 bps higher than where it was 2-3 years ago. In Q1, the company maintained a +30% YoY growth despite the contraction due to COVID-19. The diversified customer base helped a lot in this case as there were significant increases in usage from customers in healthcare, education, government, and software. Its messaging product, in particular, continued to gain traction in Q1 as more healthcare and government institutions needed to quickly roll out a solution to handle pandemic-related use cases:As of May 1, the shares price has dropped by ~9% from its 5-day high of ~$79 per-share. As the market prices in the near-term contraction, we believe that long-term investors should notice and take the opportunity to buy the stock at a bargain.(source: google)At the current ~9.3x P/S, the stock is attractively priced. For context, the stock spent most of 2019 trading at a mid-double-digit P/S. Furthermore, back when we wrote about the stock in March, it was trading at a ~12x P/S. Back then, we projected a ~$84 price target under the assumption that the company will be able to break the first billion-dollar of revenue by the end of FY 2020. As the company will guide ~5% below the consensus in Q2, we are upgrading our best-case price target to ~$80 per share."

Base offered a single stop solution called Apollo, which focused on improving rep adoption rates and data capture across devices. Apollo could analyze big data trends in real-time and deliver actionable, quantifiable insights to drive performance.Prior to the acquisition, Base had raised $52.9 million funding from Index Ventures, RRE Ventures, OCA Ventures, Jumpstart Ventures, I2A Fund, Hyde Park Venture Partners, and Tenaya Capital. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Zendesk plans to leverage Base's product to build deeper integrations with its own products so sales and service could collaborate more easily.

The customer support executive will be able to remotely access and control an unlimited number of Windows and Mac computers and conduct activities such as file transfer, remote reboot, and chat. The solution will also automatically log details of the remote access session into the ticket to support future support and any audit requirements.Earlier this month, Freshworks also announced the general availability of Freshsuccess, which can natively integrate customer success software into its portfolio. Freshsuccess allows organizations to improve customer results as they can quickly understand the health of customer accounts and determine effective actions.

4332237,104952,2020-03-16T13:20:24-04:00,"Zendesk’s focus on ease of use will speed up its upmarket onboarding process as it expands its direct and indirect sales channels to drive growth.The revenue contribution from clients with 100+ agents increased by 300 bps YoY.Upmarket growth will also drive further margin expansion. Long-term RPO grew by ~1.3 times to drive ~28% of overall RPO in 2020.Amid uncertainty leading to various guidance cuts and pulls, Zendesk is firm with its $1 billion FY revenue guidance and ~30% YoY growth for 2020.","Since 2019, Zendesk (ZEN) has been pushing for wider adoption of its Suite and Sunshine products from the enterprise clients. This move has been successful so far, given the 300 bps YoY increase in revenue contribution from clients with 100+ agents and solid ~36% YoY revenue growth. In addition, RPO (Revenue Performance Obligation), which represents unrecognized future revenues under contract, grew by ~57%. Much of that was driven by ~1.3x increase in long-term contracts often associated with upmarket deals. In FY 2020, the company will invest more into go-to-market areas such as sales enablement, product innovation, and indirect channels to continue to boost the upmarket growth at scale. In our view, central to the growth plan is Zendesk's ease of use and agility as a platform, which will be the key to reducing the adoption barrier at the upmarket segment.Moving towards the upmarket segments will allow Zendesk to both improve its retention rate and cash flow profitability due to typically longer contracts and deal sizes. Traditionally, aiming for higher-valued clients has been crucial in helping a fast-growing cloud software company like Zendesk to be on a path to net profitability in the long term. Zendesk's major move into the upmarket began with the introductions of its CRM platform, Sunshine, and its omnichannel CX platform, Suite in mid-2018. As the company ramped up upmarket clients sometime last year, the overall positioning has also shifted from Support to Customer Experience. These initiatives enabled Zendesk to not only increase the upmarket marketability but also ease of use and agility of its platform, which the CEO Mikkel Svane considers as differentiating factors during the most recent earnings call:Over the last year, go-to-market executions have been solid. Revenue has grown over ~36% - ~39% while long-term RPO increased by ~1.3x. Net retention rate has also remained solid at the higher end of the 110% - 120% range.(source: Zendesk's earnings call slide)Going forward, we expect this strong momentum to continue as the company focuses more on sales enablement and growing its indirect upmarket sales channel overseas. In that regard, the platform's ease of use will be more crucial in shortening the time to educate the stakeholders on the value of the product. The agility aspect, furthermore, allows for flexibility on particular deployment needs across support, sales, or other areas depending on customer expectation. Zendesk Suite, for instance, accommodates the growing demand to serve customers across channels, including chat and messaging platforms, while also offering individual pricing scheme for each feature.(source: Zendesk)One feature that highlights the platform's agility is light agent access. The feature enables clients to onboard additional customer support agents with limited functionality on an ad-hoc basis without paying additional per-user fees. From an enterprise standpoint, the functionality provides rich use cases while removing the adoption barriers that typically slow down the client's decision-making process during the trial.In our view, Zendesk is not exposed to many company-specific risks in the context of its growth plan. Its current lack of presence in the international markets relative to its main competitor, Salesforce (CRM) and Freshdesk, however, can provide a bit of a challenge in replicating its upmarket strategy overseas. At the moment, the US is still both the largest and fastest-growing market with ~39% YoY growth. On the other hand, APAC and EMEA grew by only ~30% YoY despite the relatively small revenue contributions (~28% and ~10% of total revenue for both EMEA and APAC) that typically signal upside potential. As such, there is still uncertainty on Zendesk's potential growth opportunities outside the US, where the concept of customer experience CRM is relatively nascent and varies in terms of demands aside from the fierce competition.(source: Zendesk Q4 earnings call)The company's lack of net profitability also creates a concern for some investors. Despite its relatively strong operating cash flow profile, Zendesk is yet to generate positive earnings. Much of this was due to the share-based compensation that made up ~90% of the net loss in the last two years. We think that this is not a huge issue, however, given the sharp appreciation of its share price within the same timeframe. Before the 2020 selloff in late February, the stock price has appreciated by ~64% since January 2018.Within the saturated greater CRM market where Salesforce and HubSpot (HUBS) are competing for market leadership in Sales and Marketing consecutively, Zendesk will continue to own the Customer Service/Experience CRM market.(Revenue growth, LPSN, HUBS, ZEN, CRM. source: stockrow)Against its peers such as LivePerson (LPSN), HubSpot, and Salesforce, Zendesk's ~36% growth rate means it is the fastest-growing player in the group. The growth rate is expected to drop to ~31% by the end of FY 2020, however, as the company moves upmarket and signs more clients on longer-term contracts. We do not view this as an issue however, given the solid RPO outlook.(Gross margin comparison - LPSN, HUBS, CRM, ZEN. source: stockrow)What is more impressive is the company's ability to maintain its strong growth rate while expanding its gross margin by ~250 bps over the last 4 years. Only HubSpot's margin has improved more within the same period. As Zendesk onboards upmarket clients in 2020, we predict gross margin to even expand further in 2020.(Relative Valuation. source: stockrow)When we remove Atlassian (TEAM) as the outlier in P/S comparison, Zendesk turns out to be the most expensive stock in its peer group with a 9.2x P/S. We found this to be less surprising given its stable growth, consistent margin expansion, and solid execution in the last few years. A quick look on the earnings page reveals that the company has never missed a single revenue or EPS guidance in the last 5 years. Over the same period, the strong execution has also allowed Zendesk to be very consistent with its goal. In 2016, Zendesk announced that it aims to achieve a $1 billion revenue by 2020, which the company likely does by the end of this year as reflected by its guidance.(source: stockrow)We believe that Zendesk remains a highly attractive long-term buy opportunity. Considering its $1.06 billion revenue target at the end of the year and ~113 million shares, the 9x P/S gives a price target of approximately $84 per share. The recent global selloff due to coronavirus that has been depressing stock prices across sectors also creates a good entry point opportunity. Zendesk is currently trading at a ~30% discount to its pre-selloff multiple of ~12x P/S. We feel that there is enough margin of safety for investors to own the stock today."

Despite the big drop in share price, I believe that Zendesk has a strong track record with growing switching costs. At $70, it is undervalued by roughly 21% based on my base-case assumptions.(Source: Google)Zendesk delivered a strong Q3 2019 with revenues of $210.5M, up 36% year over year. This translates into an annual run rate of $800M, which is on track to hit their goal of $1B by 2020. Zendesk has been growing steadily over the years, with revenues growing from $38.2M in 2012 to $758.8M in the recent twelve months at a 53% compounded rate. Gross margins have also expanded from 65% to 70% over the same period. Zendesk also tracks its remaining performance obligations, which represents future revenues that are under contract but have not yet been recognized - growth has been steady in recent quarters.(Source: Zendesk Q3 2019 Shareholder Letter)Even with such high growth, Zendesk is not slowing down. The company has a path to reach multibillion dollars in revenue by moving beyond support and building a platform. Zendesk has been continuously innovating in products to expand into adjacent markets such as its sales automation platform Zendesk Sell and CRM platform Sunshine. Zendesk estimates its total addressable market at well over $40B. At a run rate of roughly $800M, its penetration is only 2%, which indicates Zendesk has a long runway for growth.(Source: Zendesk 2018 Analyst Presentation)Zendesk specializes in support and has expanded into CRM and sales platforms. These platforms are mission-critical software that helps drive sales and customer experience for companies. As such, IT managers are unlikely to switch away from Zendesk because of the risk of implementing a new solution. Even if other solutions appear cheaper, they are unlikely to risk lost productively to try new software. As companies adopt more services using Zendesk platforms it expands into adjacent markets, they become more entrenched with time. This is reflected in Zendesk's high net dollar expansion rate of 116% for the most recent quarter.(Source: Zendesk Q3 2019 Shareholder Letter)There are other big players in this space such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) which has enormous market share. If Zendesk fails to ensure high quality across all its products, customers might switch to other platforms with more compelling value propositions. So far, Zendesk has achieved well in this aspect. However, Zendesk has been growing quickly into adjacent markets, so the focus might become narrower in its core service platform. As such, it is crucial to monitor their core services to ensure that growth is not harming the quality of existing products.Zendesk Sales and CRM platforms are newer markets that Zendesk has entered through innovation. From these expansions, it appears that revenue growth is the priority now, and Zendesk is not optimizing for profitability. As these are areas with new competitors, it might put some downward pressure on operating margins as Zendesk acquires new customers to recover research and development costs.To value Zendesk, I used a DCF model with the following assumptions:1) Revenue growth at 27% for the next five years, then dropping to 2% in perpetuity starting from the year 2025. The high growth rates in the first five years reflect Zendesk's track record of high sales growth and its ability to expand its total addressable market. Zendesk has been able to grow its revenues above 35% for the past few years, so this hurdle should be achievable.2) Operating margin of 30% from 2027 onwards. Enterprise software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. Zendesk's gross margins have expanded moderately from 65% in 2012 to 70% in the past twelve months. Once Zendesk scales further and profitability becomes a priority, the company should experience a high level of operating margin expansion through operating leverage. However, a focus on growth might put some pressure on margin optimization, so I estimate it takes 8 years for Zendesk to reach 30% operating margins.3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate Zendesk will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) Zendesk has an initial weighted cost of capital of 9%, which drops to 8% in the terminal year. The higher cost of capital reflects the higher risk of Zendesk's high growth mode with negative profitability. However, once the company achieves profitability and higher free cash flows, the risk should be reduced as reflected in the lower cost of capital.(Source: Author creation using Zendesk financials)The value I derived for Zendesk is roughly $9.2B for the entire company. This represents a 21.5% upside from its current price. As with all DCFs for high-growth companies, my point estimate valuation of $85 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against similar software companies.(Source: Author creation using data from Seeking Alpha)Compared to other high-growth peers, Zendesk looks cheap in terms of price/sales and EV/sales ratios. Zendesk is priced similarly to HubSpot which has roughly the same growth profile but better margins. Zendesk is also priced much cheaper than other SaaS companies like Atlassian and Coupa.(Source: Author creation using Zendesk financials)However, Zendesk would be considered overvalued if sales growth falls below 27% for the next 5 years. Potential investors have to decide if they believe Zendesk will be able to execute according to my base-case assumptions in the long run. If competition turns out to be stronger than expected and pushes down future sales growth, the recent pullback might not make Zendesk a screaming buy."
4306163,104608,2019-11-13T09:13:48-05:00,"Zendesk reported a good Q3 report with revenue and EPS coming in ahead of earnings.Management raised full year guidance, though Q4 still seems a little conservative.Valuation remains expense near 10x forward revenue.","Zendesk (ZEN), a leader in enterprise software for customer support services, reported a good quarter with revenue and EPS both ahead of expectations, though billings growth showed some signs of deceleration. Shares have traded up just under 10% since the company reported earnings, though still remains ~25% below their all-time highs. Even though the quarter results were not perfect, investors seemed to be happy enough with the metrics for a small relief rally.After Q2 earnings, the stock proceeded to trade down ~20% as management provided full year guidance that was below expectations. However during the Q3 call, management talked about their raised 2019 guidance, which I believe led to the shares trading up. After this small rally, I think investors really need to consider the valuation when it comes to this name. Billings growth slowed to ~25% during the quarter and came in below expectations. Even though these billings seemed to be pushed into Q4, we could start to see billings growth more consistently come in below 30%.Data by YChartsRevenue grew 36% during the quarter and came in ~$3 million above expectations for ~24% growth. Even after management talked about some execution challenges during last quarter, it seems like execution was strong and revenue was healthy. However, this quarter management talked about how their billings growth of 25% was artificially low as some deals were pushed into Q4.Despite this, the stock has performed well since reporting earnings, up ~7%, though I believe valuation is at a point where investors should be careful to put new capital to work. Billings growth decelerated to under 30% for the first time and investors should start to question when this will become the normal trend.Revenue during the quarter grew 36% to $210.5 million and only showed ~1% of deceleration from the 37% growth seen last quarter. Revenue was also ahead of consensus expectations for ~$207 million. While the law of large numbers starts to kick in for the company, revenue growth has remained pretty strong in recent quarters.Revenue growth in North America grew 41% during the quarter and accelerated from the 38% growth seen last quarter. However, growth in EMEA decelerated to 29% (from 33%) and APAC decelerated to 27% (from 31%). The international slowdown makes sense considering the global economic concerns and challenges in the current market, though investors should continue to expect strong growth from those regions. In addition, dollar based net expansion rate of 116% was pretty consistent with the 117% seen in Q2.Source: Company PresentationThe only big knock on this quarter was billings of $216 million grew ~25%, which came in well below consensus expectations for ~$230 million. Management noted that a few large deals were pushed into the Q4, which means we should see strong billings growth in Q4. I think the bigger concern is whether or not billings growth of 30%+ will continue to be sustainable over the next several quarters. While revenue growth remains strong, if we start to see billings growth slow down this could start to put negative pressure on the stockSource: Company PresentationGross margins during the quarter increased to 76%, compared to 73% in the year ago period. I believe, over time, gross margins will continue to come in around the 75% level due to the software aspect of the business model.Operating margins also expanded more than expected, growing to 5% during the quarter compared to 2% in the year ago period. Consensus seemed to expect margins closer to breakeven so the upside here was nice to see. As the company continues to gain scale and operating leverage, we should see margins start to expand even more. It should be noted that gross margin also expanded by 300bps, which likely flowed directly to operating margins.The revenue beat combined with better than expected operating margins led to EPS of $0.12 for the quarter, ahead of consensus expectations for $0.07.Q4 guidance includes revenue of $226-228 million, which represents ~31-32% growth. While this growth would be a somewhat meaningful deceleration from the 36% growth this quarter, Q4 guidance was slightly above consensus $226 million. With billings seemed to be pushed more into Q4, I think this revenue guidance is a little conservative and will likely turn into a beat.For the full year, management now expects revenue of $813-815 million, up from $807-811 million. This represents a ~$5 million increase at the midpoint, which was above consensus expectations given the Q3 revenue beat. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be $23-25 million which would represent a margin of ~3% at the midpoint.While management did raise their full year revenue guidance and it could still be slightly conservative, the stock has performed well since reporting earnings, up just under 10%. This seems to have taken away most of the potential upside for another beat during Q4. Management will also look to guide 2020 during next quarter, which investors could start to become a little more concerned about considering the slight revenue deceleration over the past few quarters combined with billings growth now under 30%.ZEN is known as being one of the leaders of enterprise software for customer support services, an area of IT where spending is not likely to drastically slowdown in the coming years due to enterprises placing more emphasis on the customer experience. I believe over the long term, ZEN is a great name to own, even though valuation has approached 10x forward revenue.Data by YChartsZEN has a current market cap of ~$8.0 billion and with ~$200 million of cash and ~$470 million of debt, the company has an enterprise value of ~$8.25 billion. Using management’s revised revenue guidance of $813-815 million, we can start to build out a potential 2020 estimate.With Q4 revenue growth implying 31-32% growth, I will assume ~30% growth during 2020. Assuming 2019 comes in at the midpoint of management’s guidance, which could ultimately be a little conservative, we could see 2020 revenue of ~$1.05 billion, resulting in a 2020 revenue multiple of ~7.8x.This multiple seems to be pricing in a strong 2020 in addition to revenue growth remaining healthy and operating margins likely expanding. After the recent run-up in the stock, I would be hesitant to put new money to work in this name until valuation comes down a little bit. Investors have been harsh to higher valued software names in recent weeks and this rotation is not favorable for ZEN.If we assume revenue comes in ahead of management’s 2019 guidance and is able to grow closer to 35% during 2020, we could see a bullish scenario of ~$1.1 billion in revenue, or ~7.5x 2020 revenue. I doubt there will be much multiple expansion at this level, so investors would earn their return on continued beat and raise quarters.For now, I remain on the sideline as valuation seems to be pricing in a strong 2020. I think the stock will continue to be strong over the years but I would be hesitant to put new money into the name at these levels.Risks to ZEN include continued global economic uncertainties which could impact the company’s revenue growth and consistency. In addition, along with many other software names, the company trades off a high forward revenue multiple, which could contract quickly if we were to experience a market correction, much like what we saw during the latter half of 2018."

Regardless, I consider the current valuation at a forward P/S of 10x as expensive, though investors shouldn't hesitate to buy shares if the stock falls to $58.Demand for CRM is now largely driven by SaaS solutions and cloud deployments.Zendesk plays in the mid-market customer engagement segment of the CRM space, and it is well-positioned due to its leadership in the customer support niche.Zendesk generates the bulk of its revenue from its core support solution. In recent quarters, it has added new sales automation and data analytics offerings to increase its revenue per customer while also improving customer stickiness. This has surely attracted a couple of large enterprises. This is a move in the right direction, though it seems to appear like a move a little too late given the level of competition in the CRM space both locally and internationally. However, when it comes to improving the average deal size, I believe this will have a long-term positive impact on its operating margin. It will also help reduce the risk of relying on its support solution as its primary cash cow. This move was, of course, driven by acquisitions that have impacted the company's net cash position.Management reported recurring revenue improved 46% last quarter. For a SaaS business, this is one of the most important metrics to track. From the previous earnings call:Also, management has restructured its product pricing approach. New products like Zendesk Suite (bundled omnichannel solution) and Duet (sales + customer service) will help offer more value to customers.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Moving to its financials, gross margin hasn't improved over the past two years, though operating margins have improved over the years. Management has demonstrated the ability to drive operating efficiency; going forward, I expect the trend to continue.On its balance sheet, Zendesk has a net negative cash position. I consider this a red flag as growth stocks should be able to raise cash from equity mostly via revenue growth, driving investors' sentiment towards multiple expansion. A net negative cash position is a sign that not enough investors have warmed up to the level of innovation that the business is selling. It has a debt to equity ratio of 138% and a current ratio of 0.67. These ratios are unattractive as they indicate the potential for liquidity issues, a scenario that can shrink valuation multiples in turbulent times.I don't rate Zendesk's financials as solid, though I see the potential for improvement in the coming quarters.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Zendesk has an average quant rating of ""Neutral"" and an average sell-side rating of ""Buy."" The only positive quant factor grade it has is its growth. Other quant factor grades like value, momentum, profitability, and EPS revision are all poor. Zendesk has an average analyst price target of $103, driven by the 33% revenue growth projection in 2020. Its operating cash flow is a function of stock-based compensation required to attract talent to keep sales and innovation flowing. Like other unprofitable SaaS plays, Zendesk's valuation is based on the hopes that margins will improve over time to drive free cash flow. Though most of these SaaS plays are acquisition targets, regardless, I consider a potential acquirer as a lender of the last resort. In the near term, I expect the revenue growth story to continue. Therefore, I don't consider the 33% growth projection in 2022 as out of reach. This amounts to a forward price to sales of roughly 10x, which is a bit on the high side. Comparing Zendesk's valuation to competitors provides little insight as most peers are equally unprofitable and overvalued. I prefer a more conservative sales multiple of 7x heading into 2020, which corresponds to a price per share of $58.SourceThe CRM market remains congested and heavily contested. Though, niche players like Zendesk have been able to carve out a thin moat around their revenue stream.

A lot of tech stocks have given back significant portions of their gains in the past two months. This has driven a lot of volatility as tech stocks have been out of favor. When you add geopolitical tension, I expect volatility to persist in the near term. As a result, I won't be too quick to dismiss names like Zendesk, even at their lofty valuation. Certainly, if the stock falls to $58, I will be a buyer. Regardless, I rate Zendesk a Hold in the near term."

At one point in the year, Zendesk shares looked poised to crack above $100 for the first time; now, the stock sits ~25% below its year-to-date highs. However, Zendesk did just release a bullish third-quarter earnings report that deflected away many of investors' concerns for last quarter. Buoyed by the better-than-feared results, shares of Zendesk jumped 5%:Data by YChartsLet's cut to the chase: I believe investors should hold on for Zendesk to continue its recovery rally. At its core, Zendesk is still the market-leading customer service SaaS tool, and while its growth rates are certainly tipping downward due to the company's own scale, recent initiatives like the CRM Sunshine product drive home the point that Zendesk has a ""second act"" outside of customer service that can extend its market opportunity. Other newly-launched products include Zendesk Sell, a sales force automation tool that facilitates the backend operational guts behind the sales cycle, and Zendesk Gather, an ancillary tool to the customer service app that helps Zendesk clients create their own customer support forums. Zendesk's third-quarter results, which we'll dive through in more detail shortly, showcase a company that is certainly decelerating, but not quite as quickly as investors (and perhaps the company itself) had feared. Still, its share price remains under heavy pressure. Valuation remains one of the key reasons that makes for a good near-term entry point in Zendesk. At present share prices just shy of $70, Zendesk trades at a market cap of $7.71 billion. After netting out $871 million of cash and $477 million of convertible debt on Zendesk's balance sheet, we are left with an enterprise value of $7.32 billion.For the next fiscal year, Wall Street consensus is projecting $1.06 billion in revenues (per Yahoo Finance), representing 30% y/y growth over the midpoint of Zendesk's FY19 revenue guidance at $814 million. This gives Zendesk a current valuation of 6.9x EV/FY20 revenues - one of the cheapest multiples in Zendesk's history, bearing in mind that as recently as last year, Zendesk traded at revenue multiples in the low teens. For a company that continues to grow north of >30% y/y, I continue to believe Zendesk has room for multiples expansion once sentiment improves. I'm adjusting my twelve-month price target to $91, representing 9x EV/FY20 revenues and 30% upside from current levels. Hang on tight to your shares and wait for the recovery to happen in full.Let's take a step back to last quarter, when shares of Zendesk plummeted from above $90 due to the company's guidance release for Q3. In that statement, Zendesk guided to Q3 revenues of $206-$208 million, representing a decay to 33% y/y growth - versus 37% y/y growth in Q2.Here's how Zendesk actually ended up performing in Q3:Figure 1. Zendesk 3Q19 resultsSource: Zendesk Q3 investor letterAs can be seen in the table above, Zendesk did quite a bit better than it expected. Q3 revenues clocked in at $210.5 million (+36% y/y), decelerating only one point versus Q2's 37% y/y growth rate versus the three to four points of implied decelerations Zendesk's original guidance, and beating Wall Street's expectations of $207.7 million (+34% y/y) by a solid two-point margin. Several key drivers contributed to the strong top-line results. The company reported a stronger large enterprise mix as a percentage of its total ARR, which rose two points relative to the third quarter of 2018. Because large customers churn far less frequently than smaller ones, this bodes well for Zendesk's FY20 revenue visibility. In addition, the company confirmed its confidence in delivering >$1 billion in revenues (which is good news for consensus expectations for next year). Here's some other useful demand qualitative commentary from Elena Gomez:On a slightly dimmer note, net retention rates continue to weigh on Zendesk. Net retention rates slipped to 116% in Q3, down for the third quarter in a row. Because renewal and upsell deals are far cheaper to close than new business, this also has implications for Zendesk's bottom line. Figure 2. Zendesk net retention trendsSource: Zendesk Q3 investor letterZendesk management continues to believe, however, that a net revenue retention rate of 110% to 120% remains a ""healthy"" range for the company; and indeed many of Zendesk's SaaS peers report similar net retention levels.The other key piece that Zendesk continues to make progress on is its profitability. Ever since the WeWork debacle and the massive pullback in enterprise software and technology stocks, investors have paid far more attention to companies' bottom line. No longer is it sufficient to produce strong growth (as Zendesk has been doing), but a path to profitability and increasing margins have also become hot-button topics.Luckily Zendesk checks off this box. As seen in the table below, Zendesk's gross margins expanded 230bps y/y this quarter to 71.9%, driven by cloud optimization owing to Zendesk's greater operating scale.Figure 3. Zendesk margin trendsSource: Zendesk Q3 investor letterIn turn, this gross margin expansion drove a 260bps improvement in operating margins to 5.0% on a pro forma basis - setting Zendesk apart from many other SaaS companies in the ~30% growth bucket, as many are still operating in the red. We note as well that Zendesk's pro forma EPS of $0.12 trounced Wall Street's expectations of $0.06.The bottom line for Zendesk: the reality is far better than we feared at the end of last quarter. Recall that last quarter Zendesk called out decelerating trends in APAC and EMEA as the cause behind decaying net retention rates and slowing revenue growth. Though Zendesk's stock has been disproportionately affected within the software sector for these remarks, we've now seen through the full earnings cycle where many other SaaS companies are reporting secular headwinds in these same international markets. Despite this, Zendesk is still clinging to growth rates in the high 30s. With shares still trading at a cyclically low, <7x forward revenue multiple, I'm happy to hold onto my Zendesk shares and build up a bigger position should shares fall further. Zendesk's current share price depression is largely a function of sentiment and investor fatigue for the software sector, but Zendesk's fundamentals are still in great shape."
4303098,104952,2019-11-06T07:24:45-05:00,"Sales execution issues and soft macro outlook in EMEA served as headwinds for the company as of Q2.In Q3, Zendesk bounced back and posted strong results to reach an expected $800 million in revenue by FY 2019. Gross margin increased to 76% from 74.5% last year.Enterprise sales remain strong, driven by the Sunshine and Suite customer experience platform adoptions. Suite now has 5,000 customers. Enterprise business as a % of ARR increased by 2 PPS.","As of October 30th, Zendesk (ZEN) shares have increased by 14.2% YTD, which pales in comparison with the S&P 500’s ~21.3% YTD’s gain. In recent times, we have learned how some sales execution issues and soft macro outlook in EMEA served as headwinds for the company. We continue to be bullish on the stock, as the fundamentals of the company remain strong as of to date. In particular, we believe that the strategic shift from customer service software into a customer experience platform will be the key growth driver. Ultimately, it will allow the company to land more enterprise deals faster with a more complete offering, while maintaining a flexible pricing structure.As of Q3, the company is on track to reach an $800 million annual revenue run rate with over 150,000 paid accounts. Sunshine and Suite, Zendesk’s CRM and omnichannel customer support platforms respectively, appear to continue to drive overall growth across the board.Zendesk continues its strong outperformance by beating its both revenue and EPS estimates despite the challenging macro outlook in EMEA and APAC. Both regions delivered good revenue growth of 29% and 27% respectively in Q3, which were below the overall growth rate across all segments. Deferred revenue growth also increased by 30% YoY. The company posted Q3 revenue of $210.48 million, which represents ~36% YoY growth and a beat by $2.9 million. The Q3 non-GAAP EPS is $0.12, which beats the estimate by $0.06. The company also beat the margin guidance by posting a 76% gross margin, which is higher than the consensus of 74.5%.The other promising factors we notice are improvements and strong maintenance in current operating metrics, such as net expansion rate and enterprise market penetration. Net expansion rate was 116%, while enterprise business as a percentage of ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) has increased by 2 PPS in Q3. In general, the strong Q3 results have boosted our confidence in the company’s execution ability and plan to reach $1 billion revenue in 2020.From the product standpoint, Zendesk has been evolving from being a cloud customer service to a customer experience platform. The recent introduction of the Sunshine CRM platform and Suite omnichannel platform have strengthened the company’s direction towards such a goal. Sunshine CRM allows businesses to gain insights from all their customer data, while enabling their developers to build and deliver custom apps and services through seamless API integrations. In that sense, the platform will be quite flexible to deploy and have a different positioning versus the traditional sales CRM software that focuses more on deal pipeline management functionalities.Zendesk's vision is to fulfill the end-to-end customer support demands across various channels, such as chats, messaging, and social media. To accomplish that, it has been acquiring smaller companies building various customer support solutions to supplement its core product. The company has also recently structured all of its offerings under Zendesk Suite. The strategic move will allow the company to position itself as a customer experience platform with an integrated CRM functionality. We believe that the new positioning will enable Zendesk to have a more flexible pricing structure that will shorten its sales cycle and expand its margins going forward.(Source: Zendesk's Q3 earnings call slide)Going into Q4, Zendesk's path is not without headwinds. We expect that the challenging macro outlook in EMEA and APAC will not change in the near term, despite the overall solid growth and product development outlook. Since the start of the year, we have seen how the slowdown in both regions has adversely affected the company's net expansion rate. Consequently, there is a potential risk of the trend continuing in Q4, where the number may further drop to its lowest level in two years.(Source: Seeking Alpha)Zendesk shares dropped by -3.6% upon the Q3 earnings call, though they jumped ~5% to reach a 5-day high of ~$70 per share on the first trading day of October 30th. Further, Zendesk stabilized to ~$69 per share. Compared to HubSpot (HUBS), Zendesk is a more interesting buy given its higher YoY growth of 38.36% and lower TTM P/S of 9.57. The expected revenue of $1.06 billion by December 2020 will set the company on track to reach our price target of ~$86 per share."

Earlier this month, Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN), a leading player in the market, reported its second quarter results that were well received by the market.Zendesk's revenues grew 37% over the year to $194.6 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $192.5 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.05 compared with previous year's $0.03 and the market's estimated $0.05.Among key metrics, Zendesk's paid customer accounts grew to more than 149,000 compared with 145,600 at the end of the first quarter. Zendesk Support now has 77,100 paid customer accounts, up 1,500 in the second quarter. Zendesk Chat saw its customer accounts fall by 1,000 to 44,300. Customers on other Zendesk products grew by 2,800 to 27,500.By region, the US accounted for nearly 52% of revenues for the quarter, EMEA brought in 29%, APAC contributed 11% and other geographies accounted for 9% of revenue. Its performance in the EMEA and APAC markets was below expectations. It will continue to monitor the macroeconomic factors in these regions.At the end of the quarter, 42% of Zendesk's Support annual recurring revenue came from customers with 100 or more Support agents, compared with 40% at the end of the first quarter. Its dollar-based net expansion rate was 117%.For the current quarter, Zendesk expects revenues of $206-$208 million with a non-GAAP operating income of $2-$4 million. It expects to end the current year with revenues of $807-$811 million with a non-GAAP operating income of $16-$19 million. The market was looking for revenues of $207 million for the quarter and $808.5 million for the year.Like earlier quarters, Zendesk continued to expand its relations with AWS. Last month, it announced the release of Zendesk Events Connector for AWS's EventBridge. The Zendesk Events Connector will allow companies to quickly and easily connect customer experience data to the AWS services that developers already use to improve their understanding of the customer journey. It's a simple, scalable way to stream near real-time data changes from Zendesk into AWS. It will further drive innovation as companies will be able to build better customer experiences by leveraging customer information with machine learning capabilities, integrating security and compliance tools, and even perform custom analytics through services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon SageMaker.Zendesk has been acquiring smaller companies to drive growth. As part of this initiative, earlier this summer, it announced the acquisition of omnichannel messaging platform Smooch. Montreal-based Smooch was founded in 2015 and claims to be a better way to deliver personal, rich conversations with customers online or through the mobile app. It allows organizations to use alternate messaging tools such as WhatsApp, WeChat, Line Messenger along with traditional SMS and emails to communicate with the customers.Zendesk already has leveraged the acquisition to release WhatsApp for Zendesk, a new WhatsApp Business API connector that will allow businesses to reach and respond to WhatsApp users. Zendesk realizes the potential of WhatsApp given that it is used by more than 1.5 billion users worldwide. It will allow companies to use WhatsApp's features that allow agents to manage real-time conversations.Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Prior to the acquisition, Smooch had raised under $10 million from investors including iNovia, TA Associates and Real Ventures. Smooch is estimated to generate revenues of $1.1 million annually.Zendesk has acquired four other smaller companies in the past that have helped it expand its service offerings. These acquisitions have been focused on providing additional capabilities for customer relationship management, customer engagement, message services, and analytical capabilities. Zendesk's stock is currently trading at $74.70 with a market capitalization of $8.3 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $94.89 last month. The stock has climbed from the 52-week low of $45.60 that it had fallen to in December last year."
4290249,104608,2019-09-06T16:12:38-04:00,"Zendesk reported a strong quarter with revenue growing 37%, ahead of consensus expectations, despite challenging global economies.Management provided Q3 and revised full year guidance which fell short of expectations, though it appears beatable and slightly conservative.Valuation remains attractive at under 8x a 2020 revenue estimate after the recent 10% correction.","Zendesk (ZEN), a leader in enterprise software for customer support services, reported a decent quarter with revenue ahead of expectations but provided full year guidance that was below what consensus expected. Shares were down ~20% at the post-earnings low, though they have rebounded 10% since the low point. I believe part of this recent rebound is overall better performance in the stock market, especially among some tech names, though the stock is a name investors should continue to own.However, not much has changed in the underlying business over the past few weeks, and investors should question whether the stock was beaten up too much post-earnings, or if this 10% rebound is actually worth it. In my opinion, valuation remains attractive at 7.8x 2020 revenue, and we could see some beat-and-raise quarters with guidance appearing somewhat conservative.Data by YChartsRevenue grew 37% during the quarter, slightly ahead of consensus expectations for 36% growth, though it decelerated from the 40% growth seen in the previous two quarters. The company has a good history of consistently beating and raising their guidance. However, their Q3 and revised full year guidance seems to imply little upside for the remainder of the year. Yes, revenue is growing nearly 40%. However, guidance implies Q3 decelerating to ~33-34%, and a decelerating revenue never bodes well for valuation.Revenue during the quarter grew 37% to $194.6 million and was ahead of consensus expectations for ~36% growth, or ~$192.5 million. Despite the slight revenue beat, revenue did decelerate from the 40% level seen in the past two quarters. Investors should not place a lot of emphasis on the decelerating revenues because the law of large numbers makes consistent revenue growth more challenging as the revenue base becomes bigger. Thus, deceleration is a natural occurrence for larger companies.Source: Company PresentationManagement did note that the global economic slowdown played a role in the revenue deceleration, as areas such as EMEA and APAC grew at sub-optimal rates (33% and 31%, respectively). While over 50% of revenue comes from the US, ZEN remains highly exposed to the global economy, and the recent signs of weakness, coupled with Brexit and potential trade wars with China, can impact revenue.Gross margins during the quarter increased to 75%, compared to 72% in the year ago period. I believe, over time, gross margins will continue to come in around the 75% level due to the software aspect of the business model.Source: Company PresentationOperating margins showed some improvement as well, expanding to 2% during the quarter, compared to -1% in the year ago period. The 300bps improvement in gross margins flowed directly through the operating margin, and while we are not likely to continue to see gross margins expand at that rate, the company has some leverage with their operating margin. Over time, as the company expands and gains scale, they will not need to spend 41% of the revenue on S&M, 19% on R&D, and 13% on G&A. These operating expenses are likely to come down over time, thus leading to greater profitability.Source: Company PresentationQ3 guidance includes revenue of $206-208 million, which represents 33-34% growth, a rather large deceleration from the 37% growth during Q2 and 40% growth during the prior two quarters. Q3 revenue guidance was about in line with consensus expectations for $207 million during the quarter, though guidance seems to be a little soft, given their history of beating and raising. Q3 guidance could have some conservatism baked in, given the company’s high exposure to international revenues, thus management being a little more cautious in front of uncertain times.Full year guidance includes revenue of $807-811 million, an increase of ~$3 million at the midpoint from the previous guidance range of $802-810 million. However, the full year guidance range was similar to the revenue beat seen in Q2, thus indicating management is not currently seeing a lot of upside to revenue for the remainder of the year. I believe there could be a little conservatism in the revised full year guidance as well, and we could see some upside after Q3 earnings.Even though ZEN’s updated guidance did not reflect their typical beat-and-raise pattern, they could be including some level of conservatism given the heightened concerns over the global economy. We have seen several companies talk about global economic headwinds for the remainder of the year as management teams seem to be uncertain about Brexit, trade wars with China, and Latin America economies.ZEN is known as being one of the leaders of enterprise software for customer support services, an area of IT where spending is not likely to drastically slowdown in the coming years due to enterprises placing more emphasis on the customer experience. I believe over the long term, ZEN is a great name to own, even though valuation has approached 10x forward revenue.Data by YChartsWhile the chart above depicts some of the leading software names in the market, it is a good indication of where forward revenue multiple could expand to. Given the fact revenue growth is still 35-40% and operating margins are floating around the positive territory, ZEN has many years left of continued improved financials which could lead to a higher multiple.ZEN has a current market cap of ~$8.9 billion and with ~$800 million of cash and ~$470 million of debt, the company has an enterprise value of ~$8.6 billion. Using management’s revised revenue guidance of $807-811 million, this implies a 2019 revenue multiple of ~10.6x. However, if we assume the company continues to grow at a fast rate and only sees a slight deceleration in 2020 revenue growth to ~35%, we could see 2020 revenue reach nearly $1.1 billion. This would reflect a 2020 revenue multiple of only ~7.8x.“Only” 7.8x is still very expensive compared to non-technology and non-software names, but as the chart indicates above, investors are willing to place mid-teens revenue multiples for the best of breed software names. It could be challenging to find a lot of companies that are able to consistently grow revenue above 35% with 75% gross margins and operating margins expanding.If we were to use a 10x forward revenue multiple on 2020 revenue, we could see the stock trade closer to $92, a nice 15% upside from the current price.Risks to ZEN include continued global economic uncertainties which could impact the company’s revenue growth and consistency. In addition, along with many other software names, the company trades off a high forward revenue multiple, which could contract quickly if we were to experience a market correction, much like what we saw during the latter half of 2018.However, over the long term, I believe ZEN will continue to post strong revenue growth and reward investors who stick with the name."

        Sunshine, Zendesk's newly-released CRM platform, will be a major growth driver heading into 2020.
        The company is also making gradual progress toward increasing its operating margins as growth rates cool off.","Zendesk (ZEN), the software company best known for its customer service tools, has just reported fourth-quarter results - and just like all of 2019, the market isn't overly impressed with Zendesk's execution. Disappointed with the fact that Zendesk has slipped from the days of >40% y/y growth, investors sent shares of Zendesk down ~5% after the earnings release:Zendesk has been a mainstay of my value-oriented technology portfolio for the better part of a year, and its most recent Q4 update contains nothing to detract from that thesis. Aside from a compelling valuation, which we'll discuss in detail shortly, I believe the core tenets of the Zendesk bullish thesis to be as follows:Let's put Zendesk's slower FY19 and focus on the future, which, according to Zendesk's latest guidance update calling for $1.05-$1.07 billion in revenues (in-line with consensus expectations of $1.06 billion), is still forecasted to grow at a robust 29-31% y/y range.Figure 1. Zendesk FY20 guidance initiationSource: Zendesk Q4 earnings releaseZendesk's slight pullback further cheapens a stock that, in my view, has fallen well behind peers of a similar growth rate. At current share prices around $84, Zendesk has a market cap of $9.35 billion. After netting off the $845.5 million of cash and $483.5 million of convertible debt on Zendesk's year-end balance sheet, we arrive at an enterprise value of $8.99 billion.Assuming Zendesk hits the midpoint of its revenue guidance for next year, we arrive at a current valuation of just 8.5x EV/FY20 revenues for the stock. Most other ~30% growth SaaS peers, meanwhile, trade well above a double-digit forward revenue multiple as shown in the chart below:Given that software multiples have bled upward in this market melt-up, I believe Zendesk shares can hit a valuation of 10x EV/FY20 revenues, implying a price target of $101 and ~20% upside from current levels. Have patience here - I believe Zendesk offers an attractive balance of reasonable valuation with strong growth prospects, and this will distinguish it from other richly-valued tech stocks in an expensive market environment.Let's now dive into the details of Zendesk's fourth-quarter earnings in more depth. Overall, I find no red flags that would warrant a ~5% decline in Zendesk's share price, indicating a fairly opportune buying opportunity. Take a look at the company's earnings summary below:Figure 2. Zendesk 4Q19 resultsSource: Zendesk 4Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew 33% y/y to $229.9 million, decelerating three points from last quarter's 36% y/y growth rate. However, this was more or less expected - and Zendesk still managed to beat Wall Street's expectations of $227.6 million (+32% y/y) by one point. All year long, Zendesk's sales execution has been the forerunning topic in all debates on the stock. This has been a top-of-mind issue for management as well, and in the company's Q4 shareholder letter, Zendesk laid out its strategy to revitalize go-to-market efforts in the coming year. In a nutshell, the company expects to do the following:And of course, Zendesk certainly plans to drive much more growth via its Sunshine CRM and convert many of its existing customers into a unified CRM-customer support platform powered by Zendesk.We also note that Zendesk has seen healthy customer metrics that show no immediate warning signs. Zendesk reported a net revenue expansion rate of 116% in Q4, essentially consistent with performance across the entire fiscal year and still representing healthy upset rates that is well within Zendesk's target range of 110-120%. Note that many other SaaS companies that reported so-called ""sales execution issues"" also saw net retention rates drop drastically, something that Zendesk hasn't suffered through.Figure 3. Zendesk net expansion trendsSource: Zendesk Q4 shareholder letterHealthy sales and customer retention trends have also fed strong profit performance. In 2019, a year that the S&P 500 surged 29%, growth was often the key topic on investors' minds. Because Zendesk saw growth rates decelerate in 2019, it wasn't the forerunning stock in the sector. But more recently, investors have zoomed in far more on tech companies' bottom lines. While profitability used to be less attractive than growth, I'd say these metrics hold equal weight now. And as market volatility continues, it wouldn't be unlikely to see more emphasis shift toward profitability and cash flow.Luckily, Zendesk has delivered on this front. As we can see in the table below, Zendesk's pro forma gross margins rose 250bps to 76.7%, powered by improved economies of scale as the company migrated 100% of its infrastructure to the public cloud. Figure 4. Zendesk key profit trendsSource: Zendesk Q4 shareholder letterLikewise, Zendesk's pro forma operating margins shot up 230bps to 5.1% in Q4. The company called out success in moving upmarket toward larger clients (which tend to be more profitable), as well as gross margin improvements, as the key driver in its profit growth. We note as well that the nominal dollar volume of operating profits nearly tripled to $11.6 million, while FCF also grew 19% y/y to $15.9 million. Value and growth/profitability balance. These are the key metrics I look for in software companies amid a rising (and possibly overextended) market, and Zendesk has both of these factors under its belt. While Zendesk may no longer be as exciting as a newer IPO like Pinterest (PINS), it is a steady performer in a software category that it virtually owns. Stay invested here for the long haul."
4280112,103480,2019-08-01T10:31:14-04:00,"Shares of Zendesk crumbled more than 10% after releasing mixed Q2 results and offering a muted forecast for Q3 and FY19.
        Zendesk follows a string of other enterprise SaaS companies that have toned down their guidance ranges, citing a slowdown in its pipeline.
        Despite short-term issues, Zendesk's customer-service platform still remains a best-in-breed SaaS product that, to date, is growing in the high 30% range.
        Zendesk, a perennially expensive stock, is now trading at a single-digit forward revenue multiple.","The market's mixed batch of earnings continues, with Zendesk (ZEN) as one of the latest casualties of the tech sector's earnings slide. The customer-service software company beat Wall Street's expectations on revenue, but offered a rather dour guidance update for the rest of the year - causing shares to sink more than 10% in response:The question for investors now: has Zendesk entered a permanently unfavorable phase in its growth, or is this short-term noise that creates a buying opportunity for the patient investor? In my view, it's the latter. Look past this quarter's miss and load up on shares at a lower price as we wait for the rebound. Let's first look at the guidance update that sent investors into a frenzy:Figure 1. Zendesk guidance updateSource: Zendesk 2Q19 earnings releaseZendesk's Q3 revenue range of $206-$208 million represents a growth range of +33% to +34% y/y, and implies four points of sequential deceleration from this quarter's 37% y/y growth rate. It's also slightly weaker than Wall Street's consensus mark of $207.1 million for the quarter. And while Zendesk did raise its FY19 guidance outlook to $807-$811 million, up from a prior view of $802-$810 million, the company's raised forecast essentially just took in this quarter's beats and was more or less in-line with Wall Street's expectations of $808.5 million. Despite this guidance mishap, recall that Zendesk is not the only enterprise software company to warn on slowing pipelines and macroeconomic headwinds. These comments have reverberated throughout the industry and hit several SaaS companies particularly hard, including Docusign (DOCU), Box (BOX), Zuora (ZUO), and several others. In my view, a majority of these problems aren't company-specific execution problems, but a reflection of cautious IT spending across the board. In effect, while only a few companies have owned up to these issues and moderated (and in some cases, reduced) their forecasts, the entire sector should be at least partially impacted. But only a few of these stocks, a group which now includes Zendesk, have seen a technical ""correction"" after a blistering year-to-date rally.Amid these types of corrections, it's critical for investors to pick fast-growing, ""best-of-breed"" software vendors that have the resilience and customer base to navigate past these short-term cycles. Zendesk fits that mold perfectly - alongside Salesforce.com (CRM), Gartner lists Zendesk as one of the pre-eminent Leaders in the latest Magic Quadrant for Customer Engagement (these Gartner rankings are essentially the Oscar awards for different categories of enterprise software). And though Zendesk's Q3 forecast implies a steeper rate of sequential deceleration than we've seen in the past, we've historically seen Zendesk sail comfortably above its guidance targets.In short - don't overreact to Zendesk's near-term disappointment. In fact, the stock's ~10% slide represents a fantastic opportunity to buy into a perennially expensive stock at a discounted valuation. At the company's present share price in the mid-$83 range, the stock trades at a market cap of $9.16 billion. After netting off the $798.2 million of cash and $470.6 million of convertible debt on Zendesk's balance sheet, we arrive at an enterprise value of $8.83 billion. Over the trailing twelve months, Zendesk has generated $703.1 million of revenues. If we assume that Zendesk can generate 30% y/y growth over the next twelve months (representing moderate deceleration relative to the company's full-year FY19 growth range of 34-35% y/y), we arrive at a forward twelve-month revenue estimate of $914.0 million. This puts Zendesk's current valuation at 9.7x EV/est. forward revenues.It's often useful to see Zendesk's valuation up against other ~30-40% y/y growers in the SaaS sector, and come to the realization that Zendesk is nowhere near the top of its comparables' valuation stack:In my view, Zendesk should be able to notch a multiple of at least 11.5x EV/forward revenues, implying a price target of $98 and 18% upside from current levels.Let's now look at Zendesk's Q2 results in greater detail:Figure 2. Zendesk 2Q19 resultsSource: Zendesk 2Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew 37% y/y to $194.6 million, beating Wall Street's estimates of $192.5 million (+36% y/y) by a one-point margin. However, growth pulled back three points from the 40% y/y mark that Zendesk had notched in the prior two quarters, normalizing back to Zendesk's 3Q18 growth rate of 37% y/y.Responding to the slowdown in revenue growth, Zendesk pointed to macroeconomic conditions in its international markets. During her prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call, CFO Elena Gomez noted as follows:In spite of these geographical weaknesses, we also note several positive notes from the quarter. Zendesk pointed out that its billings benefited from a trend toward signing longer-term deals, which also bodes well for churn and net expansion rates. The company's recently-launched CRM product, Sunshine, also continues to perform well.Zendesk also managed to drive 240bps of pro forma gross margin improvement this quarter, boosted by scale-driven data center efficiencies. Pro forma operating margins, likewise, saw a 340bps bump to 2.0%, up from -1.4% in the year-ago quarter. In addition, free cash flow saw robust 30% y/y growth to $11.2 million, representing stable 6% FCF margins:Figure 3. Zendesk cash flow trendsSource: Zendesk 2Q19 earnings releaseMacroeconomic conditions in Western Europe and China aren't issues that are isolated to Zendesk alone - these are glaring headwinds for all enterprise SaaS companies, and even broader than that, any company with a significant international presence. We shouldn't penalize Zendesk disproportionately for these macro risks. Given that Zendesk's valuation multiple has slid below double-digits, I like the stock's risk-reward profile after its post-earnings crash. Buy here and count on Zendesk's strong product positioning to help it rebound."
4288500,104952,2019-08-28T16:06:59-04:00,"With over 58 offerings across many different verticals, the Cloud CRM/customer service software is highly fragmented.The fragmented nature of the market gives Zendesk a strong moat as the enterprise segment leader.Being the enterprise player, Zendesk is well-positioned to extract the highest value clients out of the whole ecosystem.Currently on track to reach $800 million revenue for FY 2019, we expect Zendesk to surpass $1 billion annual revenue within the next 3 years.","In our opinion, cloud CRM market is one of the most fragmented markets out there. Due to the cloud concept made popular by Salesforce (CRM) in the early 2000s, the sector has also experienced disruption over the last decades, creating and establishing pockets of opportunities within. There already are a few major players in the greater cloud CRM space within marketing, sales, and customer service segments such as HubSpot (HUBS), Salesforce, and Zendesk (ZEN).In our thesis, we believe that there are two key reasons why we consider Zendesk an interesting investment opportunity. First, we like that it has an enterprise focus. Second, we feel that Zendesk has secured a strong positioning in its own segment in a fragmented market. We think that both factors have made Zendesk a strong offering. In the end, this gives Zendesk the ability to extract the highest-value clients through having established strong footprints in the niche enterprise market.(Source: G2 Crowd. Comparison among helpdesk software offerings)As of today, there are over 58 offerings in the cloud customer service help desk software differentiated by the size of their client sizes. As an over $9 billion company, Zendesk is probably the de-facto leader in the $193 billion cloud customer service enterprise market worldwide. It acquired big-name enterprise clients early on and has done well to maintain its client base. Over the years, Zendesk’s enterprise features in their products have also not only increased the switching costs for their clients but also allowed it to cross-sell within their client base. As indicated by its 10-Q, so far, Zendesk has had around 149,000 paid accounts and a healthy 117% dollar-based net expansion rate.(Source: G2 Crowd. Customer service market verticals)When we look deeper into the customer service market, there are also various ways to categorize the competitors in each space. Dividing by product offerings, for instance, we can find a self-sustaining niche market leader in each particular live chat, help desk, or self-service platform segment. In another case, we also found that there are some overlaps among cloud software markets. One of the Atlassian’s (TEAM) products, for instance, also serves the help desk market through its service desk software solution which specifically targets IT support teams instead of the customer support team.As of Q2 2019, Zendesk has beaten the revenue estimations in two consecutive quarters. In Q1, it grew its $181 million revenue 39% YoY, where in Q2, it achieved a $194 million revenue which represents approximately 37% YoY growth. In both quarters, it beats the revenue estimation by around $2 million. That being said, the concern from the market mostly will come from Zendesk’s cautious tone during the Q2 earnings call. Despite it raising its FY 2019 outlook by around 0.6% to $807 million - $811 million, the company indicates that this year’s raise will be typically more conservative than previous years. The underlying issue is mostly related to its more conservative outlook in the international market.For long-term investors, we believe that the recent 7.6% drop in price per share due to the concerns above actually provided a good entry point. We think the fundamentals remain quite strong. As we have mentioned briefly, we believe that being an enterprise market leader in the cloud software space also translates to being the overall market leader of that industry. In Zendesk’s case, where it charges a client on a per-user basis, being able to acquire one additional enterprise clients which could onboard the entire call center staff will significantly affect its revenue.The relatively higher switching cost in the enterprise space also makes disruptions into the space difficult by the SME players that have led their own niche segments. This is where fragmentation is Zendesk’s greatest moat. We feel that, in this kind of cloud software market, the benefit for SME players to disrupt vertically into the enterprise is smaller in comparison to the overall benefit from upselling or cross-selling their existing customer base and discovering new niche SME segments.There are some risks as well, which we think are also inherent in other cloud software players facing a fragmented market situation similar to Zendesk. Due to the fragmented market, Zendesk has enjoyed a lot of options when growing through either organic or non-organic strategies. Zendesk has done both in the past with mixed results. In 2014, for instance, Zendesk decided to launch a beta product internally that tackles a very niche segment in SME helpdesk market. It introduced a product called Inbox, which did not seem to produce the expected result for the company and got discontinued. Around the same time, however, Zendesk also acquired a live chat company which became the backbone of its live support product. Recently, in 2019, Zendesk has made two acquisitions in Smooch and Base. Though we believe these to be strategic acquisitions, we think that there is still a risk related to M&A deals Zendesk has been doing. Throughout the rest of FY 2019, we will also expect Zendesk to incur some integration costs to realize the total value of these acquisitionsIn our opinion, Zendesk’s more interesting growth narrative compared to expanding into other areas of CRM is its concept of providing omnichannel customer support ranging from helpdesk, self-service platform, and now to mobile messaging. Combining that with its intention to expand its global footprint means Zendesk will be able to get an exposure to the fast-growing online commerce market particularly in APAC. In APAC alone, there are over 1 billion mobile shoppers with the size predicted to reach over $2.6 trillion by 2020 in terms of online spending. Given no dominant enterprise player in the segment, we think that Zendesk could tap into such opportunity where most of the customer support is done through mobile messaging apps such as WhatsApp, WeChat, or LINE.On the valuation side, we believe that the next milestone for Zendesk is to reach Atlassian’s numbers. Given the similarity in both companies’ business models and enterprise client base, we think it could be a fair comparison. Atlassian recorded a $1.2 billion of revenue while Zendesk was approximately at $600 million of revenue in FY 2018. Assuming that Zendesk could maintain its current YoY growth rate of 39% as it has done consistently for the last 3 years, there is a likelihood Zendesk will reach Atlassian’s stage in terms of revenue 3 years from now the earliest. Despite our belief that Atlassian has priced in all its strong fundamentals, Zendesk is still quite attractively priced with TTM P/S of 12.64.(Source: Seeking Alpha. Zendesk’s P/S)Given Zendesk’s more global footprint than Atlassian and its potential exposure to more emerging markets in APAC as we discussed, we are still not sure if all of those have been priced in. As a comparison, Atlassian is trading at TTM P/S of 28.17. From the TTM EV/Sales standpoint, the numbers are also quite similar to P/S for both companies.As we have stated in our thesis, the fragmented customer service cloud software market has contributed much to Zendesk’s successful run so far. Given the maturity of the market across SMEs, mid-market, and enterprise segments, there is a greater incentive for SME players to sustain growth by optimizing retention than by vertically expanding into the enterprise. This means there has been a lack of bottom-up attempts to disrupt Zendesk’s main enterprise market. Without such pressure, Zendesk has been enjoying the opportunity to take on a more flexible approach in experimenting with its growth strategies as we have discussed previously. Collectively, the strong moat, business fundamentals, and potential difficulty for most mainstream investors to price in all the upsides make Zendesk an interesting long-term buy today."
4267854,52012,2019-06-03T02:39:24-04:00,"Zendesk had an early lead in customer service software and has the revenue growth to show for it.However, despite impressive and continued revenue growth, the company's profitability metrics have recently stagnated.With the emergence of formidable new competition, it is unlikely that the company will ever convert its revenue growth into shareholder cash flows.","Since its IPO in 2014, Zendesk (ZEN) has had a phenomenal run, as have many in its SaaS cohort. The chart below shows its meteoric rise, including a huge jump in share price over the last two years.In its most recent 10-Q, ZEN describes itself as follows (emphasis mine):Accordingly, its offerings are in growing demand, not least because the younger generations expect service via chat and across multiple channels, as attested to by this slide from the company's most recent corporate presentation:(Source: Company corporate presentation)Since its public debut, ZEN has managed to grow revenues spectacularly, as shown by the quarterly year-over-year growth chart. Recent growth continues to be on the order of 35-40%.Data by YChartsYet, while revenues have grown exponentially, owner's cash profits and net income have not seen commensurate growth, hinting at poor leverage in the business model:Data by YChartsWhen we look at this on the basis of EV-to-owners' cash profits and profit margins, we note in particular that these metrics have stagnated over the past year despite revenues still growing at a strong pace:Data by YChartsData by YChartsSimilarly, the initial leverage of decreasing stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue has leveled out at a relatively high 20% of revenues.Data by YChartsThe plateaus in profitability ratios already cast substantial doubt on ZEN's ability to convert its high revenue growth rates to cash flows for stockholders.But the prospects get much worse when we consider the competitive landscape.This telling comparison of Customer Support Software produced by FinancesOnline not only shows Zendesk's host of competitors, but also finds ZEN's product to only be fourth best among its peers. (Likewise, Fitsmallbusiness gives Freshdesk a better rating than Zendesk.)(Source: FinancesOnline)In the remainder of this section, I'll focus on the competition posed by Freshdesk (owned by Freshworks), but note that two of Salesforce's (CRM) offerings also out-rate ZEN's. (And as a large-cap company, CRM has the finances and customer base to be a formidable competitor.)Let's begin by reviewing two slides that ZEN features in its corporate presentation, highlighting its alleged advantages in terms of prominent customers and its omnichannel integration.(Source: Company corporate presentation)(Source: Company corporate presentation)Yet, Freshdesk sports among its customers Honda (HMC), 3M (MMM) and Sony Pictures (SNE). So, ZEN isn't winning on that front. Likewise, Freshdesk offers full multi-channel support, as explained in detail on this page of its website.For further competitive analysis, FinancesOnline offers a very helpful and comprehensive head-to-head comparison of Freshdesk vs. Zendesk to back up its ratings mentioned above. Please refer to it to confirm that Zendesk doesn't have any overarching competitive advantage in any particular area.Furthermore, other review sites have similar findings, with Helpjuice having this commentary regarding Zendesk vs. Freshdesk (emphasis mine):By contrast (emphasis mine):Despite having a head start in its field - and the revenue growth rate that this allows - ZEN hasn't been able to become profitable; moreover, its trends towards profitability have plateaued over the past year or so.In the meantime, $117 billion CRM has two entries in the sector, which according to one site are better than ZEN's. Similarly, a fast-growing private competitor is outranking Zendesk, such that ZEN likely won't have any pricing power going forward. ZEN is already priced for perfection (key metrics from Seeking Alpha with the stock trading at $84.24), so I expect the stock to trade down from here over time as the market awakens to the new competitive realities.(Source)"
4228738,104952,2018-12-17T11:57:23-05:00,"As the ticker has indicated, Salesforce (CRM) has become synonymous to the CRM market. Most investors buy Salesforce stocks to gain exposure into the CRM market.
        Salesforce went public in 2004 at $4.08/share. With today's price of $138/share and YoY growth of 28.5%, it's become one of the most valuable companies in the technology sector.
        Its competitors, Zendesk (ZEN) and Hubspot (HUBS), develop leading enterprise products for different CRM market segments and provide very compelling alternative investing opportunities to Salesforce (CRM).
        Our relative valuation approach (P/forward ARR + rule of 40%) has indicated that ZEN and HUBS are undervalued and overlooked opportunities today.","Founded in 1999, Salesforce (CRM) was one of the pioneers of SaaS (Software as a Service) or cloud delivery model for business software application. It is so revolutionary due to three key reasons:As the ticker may have pointed out, Salesforce is the epitome of CRM (Customer Relationship Management) market. Further, it has quickly transformed itself into a full enterprise cloud computing platform through acquisitions of then fast-growing startups in its adjacent markets such as Desk.com, RelateIQ, ExactTarget, and Radian6.(Source: Gurufocus. CRM YoY price/share growth)Salesforce went public in 2004 at $4.08/share. It trades today at around $138/share, which is a 28.5% YoY growth. A $10,000 investment at the time of its IPO would be worth close to $350,000 today. We have been a long-term investor in the technology sector and getting the exposure to CRM through our ETF position in VGT (NYSEARCA: VGT). We believe that cloud software is one of the most beautiful business models in the world today. It leverages a low-cost cloud delivery model to achieve a strong and predictable cash flow generation. There are huge upside opportunities as the global enterprise cloud adoption increases in the next decades. In particular, we feel that Zendesk (ZEN) and HubSpot (HUBS) serve as compelling alternative investment opportunities to Salesforce (CRM). We believe that these companies are undervalued and overlooked today despite their amazing potentials.Every enterprise cloud CRM software company leverages three primary methods to grow their sales:There are three main segments in the cloud CRM market: Sales, Service/Support, and Marketing cloud. Salesforce has secured the largest market-share for the sales cloud. Likewise, Zendesk and Hubspot have led the segments for enterprise customer service and marketing cloud respectively.(Source: Salesforce homepage)Except for Salesforce and Hubspot, which reports two separate revenue streams from both “subscription” of their core cloud software products and “professional services and other”, Zendesk’s professional services revenue isn’t significant enough to be reported as a separate segment. On average, professional services make up about 7.3% and 6.5% of Salesforce and Hubspot total revenues respectively.(Source: Author. Salesforce 2018 10-K Filing)(Source: Author. Zendesk 2017 10-K Filing)(Source: Author. Hubspot 2018 10-K Filing)Such trends indicate that Zendesk and Hubspot still have upside potentials to expand into other enterprise segments to grab some of Salesforce’s marketshare in the next few years. Indeed, we’re seeing a major trend where all competitors are moving towards building a more complete cloud CRM offering. In other words, convenience appears to have strongly driven the decision for businesses when choosing the cloud CRM vendor.(Source: Zendesk homepage)For Zendesk, that would be the pivotal moment where they would start generating more significant professional services revenue to increase adoptions of their upcoming products through cross- and up-selling. Zendesk recently acquired Salesforce’s fierce competitor Base CRM in September to start their march into Salesforce’s territory. Hubspot made a similar move by launching their own cloud customer service helpdesk and sales CRM software targeting small businesses.(Source: Hubspot homepage)This indicates Hubspot’s serious intention to acquire some shares in their competitors’ market while expanding downmarket to serve small business segments. Looking at Hubspot’s “professional services and other” revenue segment, it has also become clearer that Hubspot is taking this direction; while the segment has increased in absolute terms, its shares of the total revenue has declined by almost 300 basis points in the last two years.Hubspot and Zendesk went public in the same year in 2014. Zendesk’s price/share was $14.34 and Hubspot’s was $29.08. The realized CAGRs for both are about 66% and 62% respectively.(Source: GuruFocus. All-time price/share of CRM, ZEN, and HUBS)Venture capital firms primarily look at the subscription booking called ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) or MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) when evaluating a potential cloud software deal. In the revenue portion of the income statement, this goes under the “subscription” revenue. This is why we love the cloud software model. A typical cloud software company generates cash in advance that recurs either monthly or annually through subscription contract. At the same time, it is able to maintain strong unit economies of scale leveraging 3rd party low-cost cloud infrastructure such as Amazon (AMZN) AWS to serve its software applications.For us, metrics such as net income or EBITDA is less relevant when we look at this type of companies.Traditional investors usually place a high valuation on these companies’ ability to generate future cash flows. As we can see, as smaller cap competitors, Hubspot’s and Zendesk’s P/FCF trade at 2 to 2.5 times higher against Salesforce’s P/FCF.However, as an experienced cloud software investors, we typically look at other indicators as well: The rule of 40% and ARR run rate (proxy to forward ARR). The rule of 40% was introduced by Brad Feld, who is an early investor at Zynga, Fitbit, and tech incubator TechStars. Rule of 40% serves as a benchmark when measuring the health of a cloud software company. It simply means that a healthy cloud software company should have at least a recurring revenue growth rate + margin that equals to 40%. So, how do these companies compare based on these metrics?(Source: Author. Rule of 40% using Gross and FCF margin%)This confirms our hypothesis that Zendesk and Hubspot are both overlooked by traditional investors. All companies have passed the 40% rule. Yet, we see that Zendesk and Hubspot fare better than Salesforce when we applied 40% rules using both gross margin and FCF margin. In addition to having a similar size, Hubspot and Zendesk also seem to be in a similar state of growth.Both have been able to grow their ARRs significantly through reinvestment into new growth opportunities which would take their FCF margin converging to Salesforce's level in the long term.In particular, we like the fact that both companies have launched initiatives to get into the emerging markets. The New Zendesk's WhatsApp integration, for instance, would be a game changer in regions such as Asia Pacific and Latin America where many small and medium businesses serve their customer requests through WhatsApp chats. As many customers in the emerging markets are much more price-sensitive, Hubspot, on the other hand, has taken the bottom-up approach since 2016 by launching the freemium version of their softwares. This would enable them to acquire small and medium businesses that could convert into premium users as they grow. These are the upside cases of our thesis.We further look how these companies compare in terms of valuation using forward ARR. We calculate forward ARR by growing the end of FY 2017’s subscription-only revenue segment by the average subscription-only revenue growth rate over the last two years preceding 2017.(Source: Author. Comparison of valuation multiples using P/forward ARR and P/FCF)By using P/forward ARR multiples instead of P/FCF, we’d see that the market valuations for all three companies are not that far apart. Zendesk and Hubspot are valued close to Salesforce’s P/forward ARR level despite their current growth rate. This, again, confirms our hypothesis that Zendesk and Hubspot are undervalued today.Cloud enterprise CRM software market has always been and will be a very interesting market for us. With $107.2 billion market cap, many people would believe that Salesforce will have a hard time to grow faster than its 28.5% historical growth rate in the future. While we don’t fully believe that’s the case, we do believe that Hubspot and Zendesk are both very interesting long opportunities that. We have confirmed our hypothesis that both are overlooked and undervalued based on our assessments today. Further, both provide Salesforce-like growth potential as the market is trending towards convergence of full stack cloud sales, marketing, and service enterprise software offerings in the next few years."
4240023,20521,2019-02-11T19:25:48-05:00,"Zendesk has made just four acquisitions in its history.Prior to acquiring FutureSimple in 2018, Zendesk acquired Outbound.io in 2017, BIME Analytics in 2015, and Zopim in 2014.What other companies could Zendesk acquire?","According to a recent Market Research report, the global helpdesk automation market is expected to grow to more than $10 billion by 2022, recording an annualized growth rate of 32% over the next few years. Billion-Dollar Unicorn Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) reported its fourth quarter results that surpassed all market expectations and sent the stock soaring to year-high levels.Zendesk's revenues grew 41% over the year to $172.2 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $165.5 million. It ended the quarter with a net loss of $33.25 million, compared with a net loss of $24.98 million reported a year ago. On an adjusted basis, EPS came in at $0.10 per share compared with the market's estimated $0.03 for the quarter.Among key metrics, Zendesk's paid customer accounts grew to 136,600 at the end of the fourth quarter, compared with 133,700 a quarter ago and 118,900 a year ago. Zendesk Support added 1,500 new customers to end the quarter with 73,600 paid customer accounts. Other Zendesk products saw paid customer accounts grow by 2,100 to 16,900.Nearly 40% of Zendesk's Support monthly recurring revenue in the quarter came from customers with 100 or more Support agents. This number was flat over the previous quarter but recorded an impressive 38% growth over the previous year. The number of contracts with annual values of $50,000 grew 6% over the year and the average contract value increased 60%.Zendesk ended the year with revenues growing 39% to $598.7 million. It reported an operating loss of $137.9 million and a non-GAAP operating income of $3.5 million for the year.For the current quarter, Zendesk expects revenues of $178-$180 million with a GAAP operating loss of $42-$44 million. It expects to end the current year with revenues of $795-$805 million with a GAAP operating loss of $149-$154 million. The market was looking for revenues of $172.8 million for the quarter and $779.3 million for the year.Last quarter, Zendesk expanded its presence in the CRM market with the release of its platform Sunshine. Zendesk Sunshine has been built on AWS (Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)) and allows organizations to connect and understand their customer data, irrespective of where the data resides. It gives the developers the ability to build and deploy customer apps and services faster. Sunshine leverages AWS's security, scalability, and reliability to deliver a more flexible CRM platform. It will enable organizations to quickly and easily move data between Sunshine and their systems and applications.Zendesk has been expanding its relationship with AWS and is working on releasing a number of solutions and connectors to AWS to simplify data access for developers and IT professionals. Besides the Zendesk Marketplace solution with Amazon Connect, Sunshine will be able to connect with other AWS services including Amazon Kinesis, Amazon Simple Storage Service, Amazon Redshift, Amazon SageMaker, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. Sunshine will be available free of charge to Zendesk's enterprise users.It also recently launched Zendesk Sell, a sales force automation tool that is focused on driving productivity, improving processes, and enhancing pipeline visibility for sales teams. It has been launched with integration for Zendesk Support so that support agents can get more context from the sales process and are able to notify sales of opportunities identified during a support conversation. Zendesk Sell will be available for use at a price of $19 per user per month and appears to be an attractive way to upsell to its existing customers.The new tools suggest that Zendesk is diversifying from its core customer service mission to a broader customer management business. According to its management, Sunshine is Zendesk's attempt to move to a platform play.Zendesk has delivered these new tools by leveraging the acquisition of FutureSimple last year. FutureSimple is a provider of customer relationship management and sales productivity platform called Base, which has more than 5,000 customers and an estimated $20M annual revenue. Founded in 2009, Future Simple was privately held and had raised $53 million from investors including Hyde Park Angels, I2A Fund, OCA Ventures, and Index Ventures prior to the acquisition. It was best known for Base that provided an integrated service for communication, lead scoring, reporting, and other salesforce-focused activities.Zendesk is counting on the release of its sales-focused tools to help it compete with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Salesforce had tried to acquire Zendesk in 2011, but the acquisition talks fell through.Zendesk has made just four acquisitions in its history. Prior to acquiring FutureSimple, Zendesk had acquired Outbound.io in 2017, BIME Analytics in 2015, and Zopim in 2014. San Francisco-based Outbound.io, founded in 2013, had raised $2.1 million to build a web-based tool that organized the messages its users sent around the actions their customers took. Montpellier-based BIME Analytics was known for its BI tool that helped users turn data from any source into actionable information. BIME had raised $5 million and was bought by Zendesk for $45 million. Zopim, acquired for an estimated $30 million, had raised $392,000 to develop a customer engagement tool including Zopim Live Chat and GetKudos.me, which helped businesses acquire customers.On the other hand, its rival Freshworks has acquired nine smaller capital-efficient startups over the past few years. Click here for a detailed analysis of its acquisition strategy. Its recent acquisitions were in 2017 when it acquired smaller SaaS companies including Zarget, JoeHukum, and Pipemonk. Zarget delivered a SaaS-based conversion rate optimization service that provided SMBs with a comprehensive solution. Zarget had raised $7.5 million prior to the acquisition.JoeHukum was a virtual assistant that had only raised a seed round prior to the acquisition. Finally, Pipemonk, which had raised $2.1 million prior to the acquisition, had built a data integration platform that seamlessly synchronized and moved data between various cloud business apps. Freshworks has used the capabilities it acquired through these smaller acquisitions to expand its product offerings.Freshworks' revenue for fiscal year 2017-18 ending March 2018 for India was INR 259.3 crore ($36.5 million), up 30% from INR 199.2 crore (~$28 million) in 2016-2017. It has raised $249 million in funding so far and last raised $100 million in July 2018 at a valuation of over a billion dollars. Freshworks is headquartered in San Bruno, California and has subsidiaries in UK, Europe, India, and Australia. It isa private company and does not disclose its global consolidated financials.What other companies do you think Zendesk and Freshworks could look to acquire?Zendesk's stock is currently trading at $72.40 with a market capitalization of $7.75 billion. It had touched a year high of $78.85 earlier this week. The stock has climbed from the year low of $37.81 that it had fallen to nearly a year ago."

The company's stock rose double digits after reporting one of its best fourth-quarter results ever, with revenue growth accelerating from the prior quarter and lending support to a bullish outlook for FY19. Zendesk's post-earnings rally has lifted the stock to new all-time highs near $80:Data by YChartsThe question that is now weighing on investors' minds: is all of Zendesk's upside already priced in, or is the stock ready to break out? Year to date, Zendesk is already up 31% (more than double the software index (IGV), at 13% for the year-to-date); and over the past twelve months, Zendesk shares have rocketed up 96%, versus 26% for the IGV.Last quarter, I wasn't fully bullish on Zendesk, believing the company to be a hold amid a steep valuation at ~10x forward revenues and a turbulent market. Now, however, Zendesk's bullish outlook has pushed its valuation multiples down, and the combination of accelerating growth and operating margin gains have me positive on Zendesk despite its higher share price. In my view, barring a wider market meltdown, Zendesk can continue to outperform its peers in the software sector as well as the broader S&P500. Now is a good time to go long on Zendesk. Let's quickly check where Zendesk is currently trading against its latest guidance view:Figure 1. Zendesk FY19 guidanceSource: Zendesk 4Q18 earnings releaseZendesk's guidance range of $795-$805 million represents a midpoint growth pace of 34% y/y versus this year's revenues of $598.7 million. Note that this guidance outlook came in well above Wall Street's expectations of $779.3 million (+30% y/y). Yet even Zendesk's higher outlook feels like there's additional opportunity on top. Considering that this quarter's revenue growth accelerated to 41% y/y, it wouldn't be unreasonable to see Zendesk's growth clocking in at the high 30s next year - especially since this is a company that typically sees very little deceleration from quarter to quarter.Zendesk currently has a market cap of $8.17 billion; after netting out $821 million of cash and $458 million of convertible debt, the company has an enterprise value of $7.81 billion. Versus an $800 million revenue outlook for the coming year, Zendesk trades at a revenue multiple of 9.8x EV/FY19 expected revenues.While that certainly isn't cheap, there are plenty of software peers in a similar 30-40% growth range that trade at higher multiples. Zendesk is far from being the most expensive stock in the software sector:Data by YChartsWhat is additionally encouraging about Zendesk's outlook is that it also bakes in some operating margin improvement (2% expected in FY19; versus 1% in FY18), as well as significant free cash flow growth (midpoint of $60 million represents 65% y/y growth over FY18). Given the turbulent state of the market and investors' still-leery perspective on growth stocks that are suffering huge losses, Zendesk's ability to churn out strong bottom-line metrics offers the company a huge safety net. In my view, Zendesk is tackling a sufficiently large market (especially with the recent addition of its CRM product, which addresses one of the largest market categories within enterprise software) to continue growing at its high 30s/low 40s pace over several more quarters. Though the stock price has glided upward, Zendesk's growth trajectory has sailed upward in tandem. Be prepared to benefit from a breakout in this stock.Let's take a closer look at how Zendesk performed in the fourth quarter of FY18:Figure 2. Zendesk 4Q18 resultsSource: Zendesk 4Q18 earnings releaseRevenues grew 41% y/y to $172.2 million, putting Zendesk at just shy of a $700 million annualized revenue run rate. Wall Street was expecting a much tamer growth rate, with consensus expectations coming in at $165.6 million (+36% y/y) - indicating a five-point beat this quarter. Note also that last quarter's revenues had grown at 38% y/y, meaning Zendesk accelerated three points this quarter. For a company of Zendesk's scale, approaching nearly a $1 billion revenue run rate, a three-point acceleration is a true accomplishment. One driver behind the outperformance in the fourth quarter is the release of Zendesk Sunshine, the company's new CRM platform that competes head-to-head against industry heavyweights like Salesforce Sales Cloud (CRM) and Microsoft's Dynamics CRM (MSFT). Customer-support software and CRM tend to go hand in hand, so Zendesk has natural cross-selling synergies in introducing Zendesk Sunshine. The blurb below offers some color on the product's key features:Figure 3. Zendesk SunshineSource: Zendesk 4Q18 earnings deckMikkel Svane, Zendesk's founder and CEO, also offered additional qualitative insights on the Q4 earnings call that highlighted Sunshine's current traction in the market:It's useful to recall that CRM is a billion-dollar category for companies like Salesforce already. Even capturing a small piece of this market can help Zendesk to maintain its high growth rates.Profitability metrics also trended well in the quarter. Zendesk retained its high pro forma gross margins of 74% (flat to last quarter), while driving terrific improvements to its operating margin. Like most software companies, the biggest expense category for Zendesk is sales and marketing - this quarter, Zendesk drove down S&M costs to just 41% of revenues, down three points from 44% in the year-ago quarter. Pro forma operating profits came in at $4.8 million, representing a 3% margin - four points better than a -1% in the year-ago quarter.Unsurprisingly, Zendesk's pro forma EPS of $0.10 also beat Wall Street's estimates of $0.03 by a wide margin. Full-year free cash flows also grew approximately 2x from the prior year to $36.3 million, hitting an FCF margin of 6% (versus 4% in FY17). As previously mentioned, Zendesk's guidance calls for a midpoint of $60 million in FY19 FCF, representing further FCF margin expansion to 7.5%.Zendesk is nailing targets across the board. On top of accelerating its revenue growth, the company is managing to slim down its sales costs and drive operating margin expansion, while also continuing a rapid growth pace for free cash flows. Management has also indicated that Zendesk's CRM product has had strong early traction in the markets, laying the groundwork for sustained growth in 2019.That being said, we always have to be mindful of the risks facing a high-growth stock with a premium valuation multiple. In my view, one of the biggest risks facing Zendesk is competition within its core service desk space. While the company is doubling down on CRM, losing market share in its flagship product may cause unexpected deceleration for Zendesk. Salesforce's (CRM) Service Cloud is a major contender; as is Twilio's new Flex offering that allows developers to self-build their own customer contact centers.For now, however, Zendesk has retained a ""best-in-breed"" reputation that has allowed it to retain its pace of growth and customer acquisitions. Amid this recent outperformance, Zendesk's near-double-digit revenue multiple doesn't appear too expensive. In my view, Zendesk will continue to lead the pack of software stocks in 2019."

ServiceNow (NOW) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are two such companies. ServiceNow is a market leader in the IT Service Management (ITSM) industry and has a 5-year growth rate of 44%. Salesforce.com dominates the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) market segment. Salesforce.com is a much larger company with $14 billion in revenues but still manages a 26% revenue growth rate. Zendesk has only $700 million in revenues but sports a great 5-year annualized growth rate of 53%. While Zendesk operates in the same market segments as ServiceNow and Salesforce.com, Zendesk focuses on small businesses as opposed to the enterprise space making it easier to grow revenues without direct competition from the big boys.According to Zendesk's recent Investor Presentation, the company expects to reach $1 billion in revenues in 2020, certainly a goal within reach given the company's extraordinary growth rate.Source: Zendesk Investor Presentation - SlideshowWith Zendesk's recent transition to Amazon.com's (AMZN) AWS platform for improved scalability and now offering a suite of products, the company is positioned to continue its growth trajectory for several years to come. It is my contention that Zendesk is an excellent company and a buying opportunity at the current price for those investors interested in high-growth digital transformation stocks.As I explained in my last article on Smartsheet (SMAR), another high-growth SaaS company, high growth companies generally don't measure up based on traditional value metrics. In fact, they often confound analysts. A good example is this article written in March 2018 stating that Zendesk has little chance against industry goliaths. Since that point in time, Zendesk's stock price has more than doubled, rising from $43 to a recent $91.I generally throw out traditional value factors and focus on other measures such as revenue growth, the so-called ""rule of 40"" for software companies, and my favorite: how the company has historically performed relative to analyst estimates.Source: portfolio123.comAs can be seen from the annual growth rates above, Zendesk's most recent YoY sales growth is 39.6%. The trend for both annual and quarterly revenue is picture perfect. By the way, this is typical of many of the digital transformation enabling stocks that I follow, my version of paradise.Source: portfolio123.comZendesk's free cash flow margin has been growing steadily from 2016's -5.5% to nearly +6% of revenues today. This is a good sign that indicates that the company is healthy and reaching a level of maturity in its operations.Source: portfolio123.comI examine how a company performs versus analyst estimates as it gives me a feel for how conservative company management is, how well they communicate with the investment community, and how mature the management team is. This is a good predictor of what to expect in future quarterly results. With that said, Zendesk has an extremely good record of analyst estimates beats. They have exceeded estimates for the last 5 quarters for both sales and EPS.Source: portfolio123.comAnalysts are challenged when it comes to valuing young software-as-a-service companies. While these companies tend to generate high revenue growth rates, they also tend to be unprofitable due to large investments in research and development and sales and marketing. Discounting future cash flows requires many assumptions that are typically unreliable and difficult to support.One industry metric that is often used for early-to-mid stage software companies is the ""Rule of 40"". It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40, some analysts use EBITDA, others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin as the figure is useful in a later part of my analysis.Some analysts interpret the Rule of 40 as follows: as long as a company's growth rate is at least 40 percentage points higher than its free cash flow margin, a high-growth SaaS company can burn as much cash as it likes in order to drive growth.I think it is safe to say that Zendesk is burning as much cash as it likes. All one has to do is look at the S&GA as a percentage of revenues. The ratio of S&GA to revenues is approximately 91%, much higher than what would be expected from a more mature SaaS company with a figure typically around 50-60%.Source: portfolio123.comNote that SG&A consists of Sales&Marketing, General&Administration, and R&D.According to the Rule of 40, the cash burn is OK so long as revenue growth plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more.Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 39% + 6% = 45%In the case of Zendesk, burning cash appears to be ""acceptable"".Revenue growth plus FCF margin is sometimes referred to as the ""Efficiency Score"". It has been determined that a company's Efficiency Score has a greater than 70 percent correlation to a public SaaS company's revenue multiple, which is a company's valuation divided by its revenue.In order to demonstrate this, I have plotted the EV/Sales multiple versus the Efficiency Score in MS EXCEL for the 57 stocks in my Digital Transformation stock list. A linear trend line is plotted through the scatter plot that represents best-fit valuation multiple for a given Efficiency Score. Based on this data, Zendesk's stock price appears to be reasonably valued compared to the rest of the stocks in my custom universe.The stock chart is one aspect of Zendesk that I find attractive as the stock price is approaching all-time highs and appears to be on the verge of surging higher from here.Source: yahoo.comMcKinsey & Company prepared an article called Grow fast or die slow that came to the conclusion that growth predicts long-term success and matters more than margin or cost structure.An investment in Zendesk comes with several risks. For starters, the stock market bull market is long in the tooth, and we could enter a bear market in the not-too-distant future based on a slowing economy or a resurgence in trade tensions between USA and China.In addition, SaaS stocks are on a tear, many of which are reaching all-time highs. Some analysts believe that we are in for a second ""dot-com"" crash due to lofty valuation levels.Also, the digital workplace is highly competitive, as there are not only large players such as ServiceNow and Salesforce.com, but there are also a number of small private companies offering similar products such as Freshdesk. Unfortunately, Zendesk does not have a competitive economic moat and there is the possibility of losing market share to competitors.Zendesk is one of many players involved in digital transformation. The company has chosen a ""growth at all cost"" strategy for building the business. While S&GA expenses are quite high, YoY growth is 39%. The company expects to reach $1 billion in revenues in 2020, a realistic target. The stock price appears to be getting ready for a breakout, and in this article, I propose going long the stock. As with any investment, there are risks associated with this trade, including a dip in economic growth, a ""dot-com"" crash, and increased competition.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"
4218900,103480,2018-11-06T15:20:59-05:00,"Zendesk reported strong Q3 results that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom line.Revenue growth, however, decelerated one point relative to Q2's growth rate.Below-average gross margins also continue to be a problem for the company, with margins falling to 69.6% this quarter (40bps lower from 70.05% in the year-ago Q3).Zendesk is still appealing as a growth stock, but its ~10x forward revenue valuation makes it unattractive in a market that has abandoned growth names.Zendesk is a hold right now. Even though the stock is down 25% from recent highs, Zendesk is still up more than 60% for the year.","For the first time in many quarters, shares of Zendesk (ZEN) actually skidded modestly after reporting Q3 results - unusual for a company that typically jumps more than 10% after earnings, as it did after beating estimates in Q2. This quarter the story is no different - Zendesk beat Wall Street's numbers all around, but the beat margin on the top line is thinner than in quarters past. In a quarter where many well-known technology companies have crumbled due to weaker-than-expected top line results, Zendesk's post-earnings pullback is not an anomaly.A look at the year-to-date chart for Zendesk clearly shows a stock that is down meaningfully from its highs. The stock touched an all-time high point of $72 in September and is now down 25% from those levels. That would officially put the stock in bear market territory. Keep in mind, however, that even with the sharp decline in October (which is more or less in-line with other high-growth SaaS stocks), that Zendesk is still up an enviable 60% for the year. In my view, a correction was long warranted for this hot stock.ZEN data by YChartsEven with the pullback, Zendesk's stock doesn't scream cheap just yet. Its revenue multiple has sunk below 10x for the first time in months, but paying just under 10x forward revenues for a company whose top-line growth rate has slipped below 40% and is still only generating minimal free cash flow isn't terribly appealing. The market has reacted coldly to high-growth tech stocks in the month of October, and many other high-growth names like DocuSign (DOCU) have slipped now far below 8x forward revenues, so I'd much rather nibble at those than at Zendesk.Zendesk is a hold right now. At 9.9x forward revenues against a 40% forward revenue multiple and a nascent free cash flow profile, I'd say the company is fairly valued. There are many things I like about the company. Even after reaching a ~$600 million annualized revenue run rate, the fact that Zendesk is still able to grow at ~40% is astounding. However, risks for the company abound. It is one of the top recognized leaders in customer service software, but other SaaS giants like Salesforce's Service Cloud (CRM) and ServiceNow are also high-profile players in the space. As the number of greenfield market opportunities declines and the space becomes less fresh, Zendesk's battle for market share will only intensify.It's also worth noting that Zendesk is still mostly a one-product company at this point. Yes, it's true that Zendesk now markets the Zendesk Suite, which is comprised of a number of different products/modules for support, customer ticketing, and other functions, but Zendesk is still in only one category of software.It's fine for Zendesk to be focused on its niche of service software at this stage in its lifecycle - it's still a mid-cap tech stock at a market cap of ~$5 billion, but the software stocks that have been able to grow into the next level have all found a lucrative pivot to extend their product lineup into. Workday (WDAY) did it with ERP and finance software, building on its flagship HCM strengths to create an integrated backend software package. Atlassian (TEAM) did it with enterprise chat (and so too did Facebook (FB), as a matter of fact). The list goes on and on. The few software companies that have managed to scale into mega-cap territory, like Salesforce and Adobe (ADBE), have all been multi-product successes. Zendesk can't grow to a $2-3 billion revenue scale on one product line alone. Until we see that Zendesk has a credible extension for its brand, we have to assume that the company's growth trajectory will be fairly limited as it approaches the $1 billion revenue mark.I'm a buyer of Zendesk if the shares fall into the low $40s. My price target on the stock is $46, representing an 8x forward revenue multiple and 18% downside from current levels.Let's take a closer look at Zendesk's third-quarter results:Figure 1. Zendesk 3Q18 earnings resultsSource: Zendesk investor relationsTotal revenues grew 38% y/y to $154.8 million, beating Wall Street's estimates of $112.3 million (+35% y/y) by a comfortable three-point margin. Last quarter, that gap between results and expectations had been slightly wider at four points. Still, a beat is a beat - and we do have to acknowledge again that for a company that is generating >$150 million in quarterly revenues, a near-40% growth rate with barely any deceleration from prior quarters is truly impressive.A few useful qualitative comments from CEO Mikkel Svane's prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call:Zendesk's greater push into enterprise deals will be especially important for the company to retain its ~40% growth range. Zendesk has historically been strong in the SMB space, but if it wants to hit its goal of becoming a $1 billion company by 2020 (a goal it has repeated on numerous occasions, including this quarter's earnings call), it will have to gain greater traction upmarket. Major wins and expansions in the quarter included Yext (YEXT), RPM International (NYSE:RPM), Ingersoll Rand (NYSE:IR), and tax firm Jackson Hewitt.Gross margins, however, did not see the same strength as top-line growth. Margins declined 40bps to 69.6% this quarter, down from a gross margin of 70.0% in the year-ago quarter. Management blamed the margin drop on the company's acquisition of the lower-margin FutureSimple, but this still continues a disappointing trend from Q2, where gross margins had dipped 110bps.Operating margins also saw little improvement. Zendesk is still obviously focusing on its growth, but at its scale, we'd be a little happier with Zendesk's results if it struck a better balance between growth and profitability. The company achieved only a tiny amount of leverage on its sales spending, which grew 37% y/y to $74.3 million, consuming 48.0% of total revenues (only 40bps less than 48.4% in the year-ago quarter). Operating losses widened to -$34.2 million, representing a GAAP operating margin of -22.0% - only slightly better than -23.7% in 3Q17.Pro forma EPS of $0.09 beat Wall Street's consensus of $0.04 by five cents, largely thanks to the revenue upside. The company's free cash flow margins, however, remain slim. While free cash flow has grown tremendously in the year-to-date (nearly 4x last year's FCF), cumulative free cash flow generated since January of $23 million only represents an FCF margin of 5%.Figure 2. Zendesk FCFSource: Zendesk investor relationsLarger and more mature software companies, by contrast, have been able to generate FCF margins in the 20-30% range - including Dropbox (DBX), which only went public this year. Going forward, Zendesk's margin profile and free cash flow generation will become more important for investors as growth cools off.My outlook on Zendesk shares over the next six months is neutral. Though the company has continued an impressive pace of growth, its margin expansion and cash flows leave a lot to be desired. At a valuation of nearly 10x forward revenues, Zendesk is essentially priced for perfection, and the risks to the downside far outweigh those to the upside.In particular, investors will be watching for Zendesk's FY19 guidance, due when it reports Q4 earnings in February. If Zendesk guides low for FY19 (as in, a growth rate in the low 30s), investors may begin to strip Zendesk of its premium valuation relative to other SaaS peers. Buy the stock if it slides considerably lower, but otherwise, stay on the sidelines."
4192924,103480,2018-08-01T05:52:18-04:00,"Zendesk shares rallied nearly 10% after posting strong Q2 results, with revenues showing a minor acceleration from the prior quarter.This beat continues a longstanding trend of Zendesk beating Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines, but shares have also become much more expensive this year.One worrying sign: Gross margin fell 110 bps from 700% in 2Q17 to 68.9% this quarter.The presence of formidable competition from the likes of Salesforce and Atlassian may force a cap on Zendesk's growth in the near term.","Customer service software company Zendesk (ZEN) has been one of the most popular SaaS plays of the year. Looking at the company's earnings history, it's fairly intuitive to understand why: Zendesk has been an incredibly consistent performer, delivering healthy beats to Wall Street consensus each and every quarter. For the stock to rise 7-8% after reporting results, as Zendesk just did for Q2, has become a repeat occurrence over the past several quarters. You'd think that by now, analysts would know to up their expectations for this company.ZEN data by YChartsYear to date, as shown in the chart above, Zendesk's shares have risen more than 60% - one of the best performances in a technology sector that has been rattled by some high-profile earnings stumbles. What we've learned from the earnings season so far: don't get too attached to any one name, especially if it's a perennial fan favorite. Neither Netflix (NFLX) nor Facebook (FB) were immune to the market's wrath this quarter, and neither will Zendesk going forward. Though we haven't seen it yet, the slightest miss - whether on retention rates, gross margin, or its nascent cash flows - can send shares into a double-digit tailspin.With Zendesk's valuation approaching a double-digit revenue multiple, investors should become increasingly cautious on being long on Zendesk, instead of being overly complacent. It's true that several names have been able to sustain double-digit revenue multiples for extended periods of time - such as ServiceNow (NOW) and Adobe (ADBE) - but overgrowth names tend to make for ripe selloff targets, as this quarter has shown. In the software sector specifically, two longtime favorites were knocked down last quarter - Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT), neither of which have recovered fully in the three months since.For the moment, Zendesk's story still seems to be full steam ahead. But in the spirit of taking a contrarian viewpoint, it's useful to note all the things that could go wrong. The primary roadblock, in my view, is intensifying competition. It's well understood that Zendesk is one of the most popular vendors in the customer service and service desk space, but there are plenty of well-heeled incumbents waiting to steal a few points of market share.Salesforce (CRM) is one such name. With growth in its core CRM product losing steam over the past year (purely to its own scale - Salesforce has basically penetrated into the vast majority of the CRM market already), the company has turned its focus to its Service Cloud and PaaS offerings to drive growth. Last quarter in Salesforce's Q1 earnings report, Service Cloud grew ~30% y/y and made up 30% of the company's overall revenue base. Note that Service Cloud's annual run rate of >$3 billion is already about quadruple the size of Zendesk's. Another competitor to watch out for is Atlassian (TEAM), the developer behind the popular Jira brand of workflow and service desk tools. Atlassian just sold its Trello enterprise unit to Slack, citing a desire to focus more on its core businesses - service desk software being chief among Atlassian's flagship products.While Zendesk has held up fine against competition in recent quarters, it's widely known that service-oriented software has become a crowded market of late and it's not unreasonable to expect that this heightened level of competition will eat into a few points of Zendesk's growth in the near term. Zendesk has been posting incredible ~40% revenue growth for quite some time now - and if that growth slows down, the stock could be in for a nasty surprise - as was Facebook's when it announced a decelerating guidance trend for the remainder of the calendar year.There's no doubt that Zendesk is one of the highest-quality growth stories in the SaaS space at the moment. But great businesses don't necessarily equate to great stocks, especially if they are trading at ~10x forward revenues. At best, I think Zendesk is a hold and investors would be wise to use the earnings rally to lock in gains.Here's a look at Zendesk's Q2 earnings results, which investors applauded with an ~8% post-market rally:Figure 1. Zendesk Q2 resultsSource: Zendesk investor relationsAs is usual with this company, Zendesk wowed analysts on the top line. Revenues grew 39% y/y to $141.9 million, actually accelerating one point over last quarter's 38% y/y growth (at Zendesk's >$500 million revenue run rate, even one point of acceleration is impressive). And also as usual, Zendesk's conservative guidance nudged Wall Street expectations low as well - so Zendesk managed a healthy beat versus consensus expectations of $137.5 million, or 35% y/y growth.One important point to note from CEO Mikkel Svane's prepared remarks on the earnings call is that Zendesk has made good progress moving up-market to the enterprise tier:Larger customers should allow Zendesk to achieve greater sales leverage and improve its bottom line. However, if we look under the hood of this quarter, this hasn't quite yet materialized.In fact, one disappointing metric that got little screen time in Zendesk's Q2 earnings post is a noticeable decay in gross margins. This quarter's gross margin dollars of $97.7 million represented a GAAP gross margin of 68.9%, which is 110 bps worse than 2Q17's gross margin of 70.0%. Zendesk already stands on the lower end of gross margin ranges among SaaS companies, which typically see gross margins in the mid-70s or even low 80s. The fact that Zendesk's margin slipped more than one full point this quarter may be indicative of longer-term issues.An analyst from Stifel raised the issue of declining gross margins during the Q&A portion of Zendesk's earnings call, to which Zendesk's CFO answered:Going forward, investors should monitor closely to see if Zendesk is able to deliver on its promise of AWS-related savings. At the moment, while operating margins have made a slight improvement due to cost efficiencies on the general and administrative side, GAAP operating losses still widened to -$33.6 million. Despite the beat to pro forma EPS (Zendesk's EPS of $0.03 beat analyst consensus of breakeven), at Zendesk's scale, investors will be turning more attention to the company's ability to drive margin improvements. To date, progress on this front has been slow - especially with gross margins on the wane.While I remain structurally positive on Zendesk's positioning in the software landscape and its long-term growth trajectory, the fact that shares now trade at nearly 10x forward revenues makes me jittery - especially against the backdrop of an earnings quarter that has caused many investors to abandon longtime favorites with high valuations. For a company trading at such a rich valuation multiple, Zendesk certainly isn't perfect - with an extremely competitive landscape potentially threatening growth rates, and with gross margins facing continued pressure, there appear to be plenty of land mines that Zendesk investors have to tread carefully across.In my view, investors would be wise to lock in gains and wait for a better entry point."
4218230,22227,2018-11-05T11:00:41-05:00,"Zendesk’s management has remarked that they fully expect to hit $1 billion in total sales by 2020.
        If you can stomach the volatility, then Zendesk (ZEN) is the company for you.
        Zendesk allows businesses to manage customer service interactions and engage with customers directly on WhatsApp.","At the recent Mad Hedge Lake Tahoe Conference, I pinpointed software companies as a robust group of tech stocks that are the perfect late cycle investment in the economic environment we find ourselves in now.To add some granularity about my thesis, I would like to start elaborating on an up-and-coming software stock that I find compelling and in the middle of a growth sweet spot.And with the rapacious pullback, the tech sector has experienced as of late, this high-octane growth stock is poised to rev back up, albeit with more than your average volatility attached to its stock symbol.If you can stomach the volatility, then Zendesk (ZEN) is the company for you to dip your toe in.Zendesk is a customer service software offering solutions to clients through a flexible platform revolving around customer service tickets.This $6 billion market cap tech firm thriving in the San Francisco Tenderloin district only need to be reminded of how fast a tech firm can be disrupted by stepping out of the office and experiencing how fast the cityscape is changing in real time.I usually get lambasted for the lack of time I spend following budding tech firms, but you cannot blame me when the bulk of this year’s stock market gains have been extracted by the biggest and mightiest tech titans.That does not mean all small tech is dead, but they certainly do have heightened existential risk because of the Amazons (AMZN) and Microsofts (MSFT) of the world, spreading their network effects far and wide.International Business Machines Corporation’s (IBM) purchase of cloud company Red Hat (RHT) underscores the value of applying M&A to grow the top and bottom line, and the chronic bidders of these smaller minnows are usually the Amazons and Microsofts themselves who have the cash to dole out.Salesforce (CRM) is always adding to its arsenal of integrated software companies that can scale up in the cloud, and Marc Benioff’s M&A strategy has thrived to devastating effect boosting the bottom and top line.I must admit, tech does get the rub of the green over other industries because of the scaling effect afforded to profit poor tech companies.The ample time to prove to investors they can snatch a growing user base, enhance product offerings, and develop an eco-system intertwined with recurring subscription products is not fair to other industries who are judged on different metrics mainly profits and profits now.Well, life isn’t fair.The addressable market is usually massive causing investors to stick with these burgeoning tech firms through thick and thin.Zendesk is another company burning money, but let me tell you, they are no Snapchat (SNAP).Operating margins are marching towards positive territory, meaning this outfit is well-run.It was only at the beginning of 2015 when Zendesk’s operating margin registered 53%, and since then, they have dramatically reduced it to 36% at the end of 2016 and now 24% in 2018.Gross margins next quarter will be hit a bit with its acquisition of Base CRM, headquartered in Mountain View, California and R&D offices in Krakow, Poland, offering a web-based all-in-one sales platform featuring tools for email, phone dialing, pipeline management, and forecasting.Improving service offerings in the tech world usually means nabbing niche cloud companies that can easily be integrated into the larger eco-system and Base CRM, even though it has lower margins than Zendesk, is a nice pickup for the company boosting the top line while expanding cross-selling activities.Then there is the sales revenue growth demonstrating all the hallmarks powerful software companies live up to with its 39% quarterly revenue growth.Zendesk’s management has remarked that they fully expect to hit $1 billion in total sales by 2020 which is more than double the 2017 annual revenue of $430 million. This year, Zendesk is forecasted to post just shy of $600 million in sales.Large clients keep piling in hoping to modernize their customer service operations and wean themselves off the siloed legacy systems.Disruption by some fresh newcomer in a disruptive industry that they operate in is usually the trigger forcing companies to spruce up their customer service software.This path of migration will healthily continue for Zendesk reaffirming management’s thesis of $1 billion in sales by 2020.Zendesk, flaunting off their innovation skills, identified the universal popularity of messenger app WhatsApp as an effective platform for its services and rolled out a product that integrates Zendesk services with WhatsApp.This will allow businesses to manage customer service interactions and engage with customers directly on WhatsApp.The customized integration links conversations between businesses and their customers on WhatsApp within Zendesk.This move will allow Zendesk to stretch their tentacles further and wider while being able to provide faster support for customer service tickets which are incredibly time-sensitive.Since management highlighted that WhatsApp is the go-to messenger in Asia Pacific and Latin America, there was no reason not to extend their offerings in a way that captures this vital userbase.The WhatsApp pivot has been a nice addition with Zendesk’s management remarking that they “handle over 20% of our order status inquiries daily with WhatsApp and Zendesk, which is much faster than traditional methods.”Omnichannel support within Zendesk’s platform will be key to securing the growth it needs to reach its $1 billion of sales milestone.Innovation is the crucial ingredient in constructing the perfect products that can maximize customer service performance.Its overseas exploits are not just a flash in the pan with its services supported in 30 languages and offices in 15 different countries. It all makes sense considering half their revenue is outside of America.With IBM’s recent acquisition of Red Hat, buyers are still hunting for the right pieces to add to their portfolio.The Red Hat purchase proved that demand still eclipses supply by a far margin.Zendesk is one of those in the queue for a big buyer to swoop in with a mega offer.It’s no guarantee that a company will pay a 63% premium like IBM did, but some sort of premium will be definitely warranted.Zendesk offers the type of robust growth and premium cloud services that could easily fit into a bigger cloud player looking to improve their assortment of cloud tools.This type of tailwind itself will naturally boost the stock by 5-10% alone if the macro picture can somehow manage to gain footing for the rest of the year.As with the rest of tech, Zendesk dipped about 20% in the last 30 days but by no means does that mean this is a bad company with a weak future.I would very much argue the opposite.The weakness in sales offers a prime entry point in a fast-growing company that is part of the software and cloud movement that I have incessantly harped about.If this company can show continued operating margins growth, maintain sales growth of above 30% YOY, and demonstrate product innovation, this stock will break out to higher levels.As of now, that is exactly the road they are headed down.Business abroad is doing so well that Zendesk recently splurged on a Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) headquarters in Dublin, Ireland coined as the “the tech capital of Europe.”Zendesk started with two employees in Dublin in 2012 and now boast over 300 employees occupying 58,000 square feet in a new office costing $10 million.By 2020, Zendesk expects to build their Dublin branch to over 500 employees implying that the overseas pipeline is ripe for the taking.I am highly bullish Zendesk and recommend that readers check out this attractive growth story."
4161643,103480,2018-04-08T11:00:00-04:00,"Zendesk has soared to all-time highs above $45 in 2017, appreciating more than 30% amid a broad market tumble.The company was buoyed by a recent announcement that it crossed a $500 million run-rate for the first time, effectively ensuring that it will exceed Q1 guidance.Revenues are expected to grow 30% y/y this year.Shares look prohibitively expensive, however, at 7.7x forward revenues as loss margins continue to run high despite the growing revenue base.Zendesk faces mounting competition in the service center SaaS space.","Zendesk (ZEN), the customer-service software company, has been riding on a wave of fortune lately. The company is plowing on toward a $5 billion market cap, putting it far above the pack of average high-growth software companies. Since its IPO in 2014, original investors have made 5x on the company's starting IPO price of $9 - not a bad return at all for holding the stock a couple of years.Year to date, Zendesk has gone up an astounding 33% versus a loss of -3% for the S&P 500:ZEN data by YChartsBy all means, some of Zendesk's gains are well-deserved. The company has seen massive revenue growth and become a powerhouse in its space. For the unfamiliar, Zendesk provides a cloud-based software program that helps enterprises set up customer service portals. Its flagship offering, Zendesk Support, is the industry-leading application for handling customer service tickets. A screenshot of the agent interface, taken from Zendesk's website, is shown below:Figure 1. Zendesk interfaceSource: Zendesk.comBut despite Zendesk's recent success, the vaulting stock price begs the question: is Zendesk overvalued? With a few precious exceptions, as SaaS companies grow larger, the growth begins to decelerate quickly and the stock is suddenly no longer worth double-digit revenue multiples as it was back in the days immediately post-IPO. Despite the fact that Zendesk is a fantastic company with strong potential, its valuation at the moment has reached beyond the fundamentals and is due for a pullback.Here's a look at how Zendesk's growth trajectory has fared over the past five years:Figure 2. Zendesk income statementSource: Zendesk 10-KIn FY17, the company grew revenues 38% y/y to $430.5 million. Don't get me wrong: that's tremendous growth for a company of its size, but the valuation (which we'll discuss shortly) essentially already prices in that growth.Where the risk comes into play is if Zendesk begins to decelerate its revenue growth faster than expected. The company has historically had a strong track record for beating expectations, but it's not uncommon for software stocks to falter at this stage. Box.com (BOX), for example, plunged after reporting fourth-quarter earnings last month when its guidance implied just 20% growth in FY19 (calendar year 2018) versus the 27% growth it produced in FY18. With forward revenues of approximately $600 million, Box is at about the same scale (only slightly larger) as Zendesk is now.Thankfully for bulls, Zendesk surprised to the upside (but only slightly) when it gave FY18 guidance of $555-565 million in revenues, implying 30% y/y growth at the midpoint. This is an eight-point deceleration from its growth rate in FY17. This might be good enough for Zendesk's investors and its covering Wall Street analysts, but the same rate of deceleration (seven points) is what caused Box to topple. Of course, 20% growth and 30% growth are different things, but extrapolating this rate forward, it won't take long for Zendesk to falter to the 20s - especially with its product becoming increasingly saturated and up against serious competition.Zendesk recently put out a press release announcing that it had crossed the $500 million annual revenue run-rate ahead of announcing Q1 earnings. This implies that Zendesk's Q1 revenues will be at least $125 million versus its guidance for $125-127 million in revenues. That's good news, but for how long can this good fortune prosper?And despite revenues more than quintupling over the past five years, Zendesk still generated a GAAP operating loss of -$114.6 million in FY17, or a -26.6% operating margin. The company did generate $25.7 million of free cash flow, so at least that's respectable - but note that this represents an FCF margin of just 6%. Dropbox (DBX), on the other hand, generated a 28% FCF margin; Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) generated 21%.And speaking of Salesforce.com: Zendesk faces quite a bit of competition from the cloud SaaS king, which last year produced 28% y/y growth in its Service Cloud product to $789.3 million. That makes Service Cloud almost twice as large as Zendesk; and next to the original Sales Cloud offering, Service Cloud is Salesforce's next-largest product. It also benefits from being natively connected to the rest of the Salesforce platform for large enterprise customers that deploy multiple offerings. This isn't a trivial benefit - it makes sense to connect CRM (customer relationship management) data natively to customer service functions.One particularly cool feature of Service Cloud that Zendesk doesn't natively offer is Field Service Lightning, which allows a Salesforce Service Cloud user to dispatch field agents (such as an installation professional) from within the application in response to a query.Salesforce aside, Zendesk also faces plenty of other competitors. Jira Service Desk, an offering by fast-growing SaaS company Atlassian (TEAM), is another growing contender. ServiceNow (NOW) is another titan in the space, which like Salesforce offers connectivity to a suite of other software tools.Last month, Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) also announced the launch of Twilio Flex, which provides an ""out-of-the-box"", cloud-based customer contact center. Zendesk is actually a partner of Twilio Flex, and a customer can opt to use both offerings - with Zendesk powering the front-end interface and the Twilio network facilitating the communications between service agent and customer. But an enterprise company with a large in-house developer team can bypass Zendesk overall and use Twilio's more bare-bones offering that's meant for self-customization.Of course, Zendesk is still a customer favorite and a powerhouse in the service SaaS space. It's been named a Gartner leader for several years in a row, an honorific that carries weight with IT buyers. However, it would be a mistake to think that cloud giants like Salesforce and ServiceNow, as well as more lean upstarts like Twilio, won't have an effect on hamstringing Zendesk's future growth. Zendesk doesn't have total ownership of the market it's playing in.Zendesk's nosebleed valuation at approximately 8x forward revenues no longer seems to fit its 30% growth profile. In the high-growth software space, 30% is about average, and a more average revenue multiple lies somewhere between 6x and 7x forward revenues. Without the earnings profile or free cash flow to justify a multiple premium, Zendesk looks expensive, especially as the valuation seems to be unconcerned with the potential deceleration and competitive pressures previously discussed.Here's a look at where Zendesk trades relative to other cloud software companies in the ~$500 million revenue range:ZEN EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsZendesk isn't bulletproof, though its valuation would seem to suggest that it is. Even the slightest misstep from the company - whether it be an earnings miss or disappointing guidance - can send a negative shockwave to a company so richly valued.Though I still consider Zendesk to be a best-in-breed software company with a rare longevity and good potential, I don't think its status as a Wall Street darling can last much longer. While the company's high growth makes it difficult to be overly negative on the company, at $45 a share, Zendesk is at best a hold. I'd count on the company flattening down to a valuation of 6.5x EV/FY18 revenues at some point this year, implying a price target of $39."
4213861,104099,2018-10-24T12:12:57-04:00,"In a word, ""no.""It seems that the more this company sells, the more it loses. This prompts the question, if rising sales won't result in profits, what will?Worse, the company doesn't see a change in this dynamic, acknowledging that they will need to continue to invest massively.This is particularly troublesome in light of the valuation. Avoid.","Despite the recent pullback, over the past 12 months, the shares of Zendesk Inc. (ZEN) are up about 89%. I think they are overpriced at this level and I think investors would be wise to sell if they own the stock or eschew the name if they were considering buying it. I’ll go through my reasoning below by looking at the financial history here and by looking at the stock itself. For those who can’t stand the suspense, I’ll sum up here. The company obviously makes a very popular suite of software, as sales are growing rapidly. Sales growth alone isn’t enough, though, and it’s certainly not enough to warrant these valuations. I think investors who buy at these levels will regret the decision in the coming years.Zendesk is a software development company that provides SaaS products that are intended to help organizations and their customers build better relationships. The software is built on a modern architecture that allows for tremendous flexibility, allowing the company or its customers to rapidly innovate, adapt the technology in novel ways, and easily integrate with other products and applications. With origins in customer service, the company has evolved a suite of great products that work together to help organizations better understand their customers. The company is focused on the small and medium sized business market.The company expects operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars, as they must continuously invest in their software in order to broaden the functionality of their existing products and to further integrate these various offerings. In my view, this need to spend more than the company makes into the foreseeable future is troublesome.In my view, the way you look the financial history here says very much about your attitudes as an investor. If all you care about is sales, you’ll look at the past several years and celebrate. Obviously, most “investors” care about sales in this case, given what’s happened to share price recently. If you’re like me and you’re inclined to insist that the company deliver profits consistently, then you’ll have a much different take on the financial history here.To my mind it seems that the more this company sells, the larger are its losses. In fact, I ran a correlation on revenue and losses over the past five years and found a very strong (r=-.9) negative relationship between revenue and net income. This prompts the question: If growing revenue won’t make this a profitable enterprise, what on earth will? I mean, it’s not like the company can suddenly eliminate the R&D, sales and marketing, or G&A expenses and expect to remain relevant. It should be said that this trend is lingering, given that revenue in the first half of 2018 was 38% higher than the same period in 2017, while net loss grew by 24%.The shares outstanding also have grown massively over the past five years. Shares outstanding has grown at a CAGR of about 33% since 2013.Source: Company filingsI’ve said on many occasions that a troubled company can be a great investment if the price is right. I think the more you pay for a stream of future cash flows, the lower will be your subsequent returns. It also might be the case that the less you pay for a company, the greater will be your subsequent returns. The problem is that in order to pay a low price, the crowd must have driven the price lower. The investor’s job is to work out whether the problems the crowd is worried about are short term in nature or permanent.This is largely academic in this case, though, because the crowd has actually driven this company to a ridiculous valuation in my estimation. On the principle that a picture is worth a thousand words, here's a chart of the price to free cash flow.Source: GurufocusWhile Zendesk has certainly been more expensive than it is currently, at 158 times free cash flow, it remains morbidly expensive in my view.Another way to frame this overvaluation is to conduct a thought experiment and ask what would need to happen to move this stock from the “morbidly overvalued” category to the “reasonably valued” category. Holding stock price and expenses constant, the company would need to grow free cash about 8 fold to make this a reasonably priced investment. Given that’s not likely to happen in the foreseeable future, I think investors who buy at these levels will regret it.Investors need to remember that the source of all sustainable returns is profits and not revenue. If you own a business that sells products at a loss for an extended period of time, your best course of action is to shut down the business and use the capital elsewhere. For some reason, some public companies can get away with violating this law for extended periods, perhaps because they can access optimistic capital markets. In my view, sooner or later, though, the market will demand profits, and when that day comes, I think investors will be punished. In my view, price and value eventually and inevitably intersect, and I think investors would be wise to get out before price falls to match value."
4168571,103480,2018-05-02T12:49:55-04:00,"Zendesk reported a beat-and-raise quarter in Q1, with both top and bottom-line results exceeding analyst expectations.To some extent, Zendesk's strong Q1 revenue growth of +40% y/y was already foreshadowed by the company's press release last month announcing it has crossed a $500 million run rate.The company raised its FY18 guidance to $565-572 million, implying 32% y/y growth at the midpoint.However, shares seem extremely expensive at 9x forward revenues, especially given mounting competition.","Zendesk (ZEN), the customer service software company, has just reported yet another beat-and-raise quarter, yet another notch in the belt for a company that has consistently delivered market-topping results over the past few years. Here's a look at the company's earnings track record, as reported by Seeking Alpha:Figure 1. Zendesk earnings recordSource: Seeking AlphaTo some extent, the outperformance this quarter was already captured in a press release in early April, announcing the company had crossed a $500 million run rate, an announcement that had already caused shares to rally. A $500 million run rate implies that the Q1 revenue would be at least $125 million, so the fact that consensus expectations hovered so low and close to $125 million really helped the optics of this quarter's beat.Of course, a company with such a consistent track record deserves a premium valuation. Investors like to be pleasantly surprised every quarter, and thus far, Zendesk has done an excellent job of managing expectations and surpassing them. The question, however, is if Zendesk's bloated premium can be sustained over a long period of time.Shown in the chart below is Zendesk's current post-earnings valuation multiple of 8.4x EV/FTM revenues. Included in the chart are other companies that are growing in the high 30s/40% bucket, all of which trade at valuations below Zendesk. Instructure (INST), in particular, also just reported an earnings beat and saw the stock decline in response.ZEN EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThere's no question that Zendesk's high growth and pivot toward positive cash flows merits it a premium above the typical 6x forward revenues valuation for a SaaS company.But Zendesk's hyper-growth mode can't be sustained forever, especially as competition for service-desk software mounts. Atlassian (TEAM) and ServiceNow (NOW) recently reported robust earnings, and both companies have major offerings in the service desk space. Salesforce.com (CRM) is another major contender, with its Service Cloud offering the second-largest offering after its flagship Sales Cloud. Twilio (TWLO) as well, included in the chart above, recently released a new offering called Twilio Flex, which helps customers build their own customer contact centers using Twilio APIs. While the use case is slightly different from Zendesk (ready-made with full functionality, versus DIY, and custom configurations), Twilio Flex does present a compelling alternative to buying Zendesk's costly subscription plan.In my opinion, Zendesk is a fantastic company whose stock has run slightly ahead of its performance potential - much like other perennially hot software stocks like Workday (WDAY). If history is any guide, the market will eventually rotate to favor value over growth, and at that point, Zendesk may see a slight multiple contraction. My price target on the stock is $42, representing 7x EV/FY18 revenues and 19% downside from current levels.Here's a look at Zendesk's Q1 results:Figure 1. Zendesk Q1 earningsSource: Zendesk investor relationsRevenues grew 40% y/y to $129.8 million, surpassing analyst expectations of $126.4 million (+35% y/y) by a respectable five-point margin. Again, to some extent, Zendesk's admission in early April of a >$500 million run rate had virtually ensured that the company would beat this quarter's expectations. Note, however, that some of the enthusiasm for Q1 results also stems from the fact that 40% growth is a slight acceleration from the 38% y/y growth Zendesk saw for the full year FY17. When a company at Zendesk's >$500 million scale achieves acceleration of any magnitude, it is an impressive feat.In true beat-and-raise fashion, Zendesk also raised its full-year outlook. The company's lifted guidance range of $565-573 million implies 32% y/y growth at the midpoint of $568.5 million, significantly higher than the prior $560 million midpoint (+30% y/y). Analysts, on the other hand, were calling for only 31% growth with a consensus target of $561.2 million for the year. The company also has a longer-term target of $1 billion in revenues by 2020, which would necessitate >30% growth over the next two years (FY19 and FY20) as well, which is a tall order for a company expected to grow at 32% this year.There's no doubt that continued innovation is helping to power Zendesk's results. The company's recently launched Guide Enterprise offering, its third major product release in the past year, uses machine-learning technologies to drive automated and more seamless customer service actions. The Content Cues feature, for example, mines common phrase words in incoming tickets to determine which self-service FAQ articles would be most beneficial. In part due to new offerings, Zendesk notched 125k paid accounts at the end of the quarter, up 23% y/y.Like Salesforce, however, it seems Zendesk's focus is squarely on growth. R&D costs as a percentage of revenues ticked up to 29%, up from 28% of revenues in 1Q17. Sales and marketing costs also took a one-point upswing to 50% of revenues, up from 49% in 1Q17. The company's CEO mentioned on the earnings call that stability in the sales force and more tenured account execs helped drive the outperformance this quarter, but as the company continues to rapidly expand its go-to-market headcount as evidenced by the growth in sales spending, we have to watch for any potential disruptions. Cloudera (CLDR), for example, lost more than 50% of its market value in one day when it announced a sales re-organization amid comments on sales execution issues and unclear territory and vertical designations for its account execs.As a result of accelerated spending in proportion to its growth, Zendesk didn't achieve any meaningful operating leverage in the quarter. GAAP operating losses of -$33.6 million widened from the year-ago period, and represented a -26% operating margin, about flat from 1Q17. The good news is that Zendesk's pro forma EPS of $0.02 showed meaningful upside to Wall Street's consensus target of $0.03, and operating cash flows in the quarter more than doubled to $16.2 million, with $9.4 million free cash flows after netting out $6.8 million of capex.We do have to note, however, that Zendesk's -26% operating margin and 7% free cash flow margins do seem underwhelming in the face of other software companies pivoting toward profitability. Recent IPO Dropbox (DBX), for example, boasts a 28% FCF (though it is at about twice Zendesk's scale). Should the market return to prioritizing value over growth, Zendesk's sluggishness at improving its loss margins may take over the spotlight from its above-average growth.There's no doubt that Zendesk's growth acceleration this quarter and its guidance raise are major milestones toward attaining its ambitious $1 billion revenue target by 2020. Shares trade at a rightly-deserved premium. The question, however, is if Zendesk's premium spread to other high-growth peers has grown too large, and the 8% post-earnings pop has just exacerbated the gap further.In my opinion, I'd stay away from Zendesk shares until it reaches a more market-normal valuation multiple. Its current valuation approaching 9x forward revenues is certainly a stretch, as even hot recent IPOs like Dropbox (DBX) and DocuSign (DOCU) are having difficulties maintaining valuations above 9x forward revenues. Valuation does impose an upper bound on stock rallies, and in Zendesk's case, it seems that upper bound has been crossed."

Picking stocks in this sector is easier, as it’s the only sector with positive and growing economic earnings. However, not all stocks in the sector are created equal.This firm has achieved the hyper revenue growth investors love, but profits remain elusive. Now, as the market matures and competition firmly establishes itself, this firm’s lack of resources and highly negative margins create an uphill battle. Compounding these challenges, the firm’s executive compensation plan misaligns executives’ interests. These issues make this stock’s lofty valuation appear out of touch with reality, and Zendesk Inc. (ZEN) is this week’s Danger Zone pick.Since 2014, ZEN’s revenue has grown an impressive 50% compounded annually. At the same time, its after-tax profit (NOPAT) has declined from -$64 million to -$110 million, per Figure 1. The decline in NOPAT stems from highly negative NOPAT margins, which were -26% in 2017. The company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) is currently a bottom-quintile -28%.Figure 1: ZEN’s Revenue & NOPAT Since 2014Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsWhile true profits are falling, ZEN would rather investors focus on non-GAAP metrics. These metrics, such as non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP net income paint a wildly different picture of the firm’s profits. Our research enables clients to see through these misleading financial metrics. Below are some of the items Zendesk removes for its non-GAAP net income:In 2016, ZEN removed nearly $73 million (24% of revenue) in share-based compensation expense to calculate non-GAAP net income. In 2017, ZEN removed over $85 million (20% of revenue) in share-based compensation expense.ZEN reported 2017 non-GAAP net income of -$13 million. Per Figure 2, GAAP net income and economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, were -$111 million and -$142 million, respectively.Long-term, non-GAAP net income has improved from -$32 million in 2014 to -$13 million while economic earnings have fallen from -$77 million in 2014 to -$142 million.Figure 2: ZEN’s Non-GAAP Metrics Paint False Picture of PerformanceSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsZendesk’s executive compensation misaligns executives’ interests with shareholders’ interests. The misalignment helps drive the profit decline shown in Figure 1 and the disconnect between non-GAAP net income and economic earnings.Executives’ annual bonuses are performance-based and awarded on the achievement of “corporate performance objectives’ and “operational objectives.” Corporate performance objectives include net recurring revenue and non-GAAP operating margin goals. Share-based compensation is once again removed from non-GAAP operating margin, even though ZEN acknowledges it is used to attract and retain employees (similar to a salary, a standard operating expense).Long-term incentives are provided in the form of stock options and restricted stock units, neither of which have a performance-based component. Instead, long-term incentives vest over a three-year period and incentivize executives to increase share price, no matter the long-term impact on the economics of the business.The bottom line is that executives are incentivized by metrics that have allowed execs to earn bonus awards while destroying shareholder value. We’ve demonstrated through numerous case studies that ROIC, not non-GAAP net income or similar metrics, is the primary driver of shareholder value creation. A recent white paper published by Ernst & Young also validates the importance of ROIC (see here: Getting ROIC Right) and the superiority of our data analytics. Without major changes to this compensation plan (e.g. emphasizing ROIC), investors should expect further value destruction.Zendesk may be best known for delivering customer support, chat, and phone services, otherwise known as customer engagement. However, it is not the only firm providing these services, as the industry has relatively low barriers to entry and is already filled with competition, both large and small. Top competitors include Salesforce (CRM), Oracle (ORCL), and Microsoft (MSFT) all of which rank above ZEN in Gartner’s 2017 Magic Quadrant for Customer Engagement Center. Apart from large tech firms, Zendesk faces many smaller competitors such as LiveAgent, TeamSupport, ZohoDesk, FreshWorks, HappyFox, or Help Scout, to name a few.At its core, Zendesk offers customer support management, which in today’s Internet of Things and “always connected” world, is not a service that has a significant competitive moat. Support ticket tracking, chat software, phone call integration, and third-party app support are all services offered by Zendesk and its top competitors. With such low barriers to entry, Zendesk and its competition are forced to compete on price, scalability, and reliability, more so than technological advancements.Zendesk’s margins and ROIC, which rank well below its largest competition, are a disadvantage in this intensely competitive landscape. With highly negative margins, Zendesk cannot compete on price or generate the capital needed to continually improve and market its products against stalwart competition.Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings Zendesk has certainly focused on revenue growth, at the expense of profits, as shown above. However, in order to buy into the bull case, investors must ignore that the hyper-growth has not achieved the large economies of scale and competitive strength needed to survive over the long term.Since 2014, ZEN has more than doubled the number of paid customer accounts using its products, to 119,000. However, every quarter since 1Q14, ZEN’s operating expenses have been larger than overall revenue. The average revenue per account in 2017 equaled $3,600 while average operating expenses per account totaled $4,600. Since 2015, the firm’s revenue has grown 43% compounded annually with operating expenses close behind at 37% compounded annually. In total, operating expenses made up 127% of revenue in 2017.Beyond cost concerns, Zendesk lacks the capital and the operational flexibility to grow at such high rates and complete longer term. Per Figure 4, Zendesk is one of only two competitors with no excess cash and has the second highest cash burn of competitors listed. Based on cash on the books in 2017, ZEN can only sustain its current cash burn for a little over a year before needing a dilutive influx of capital.Figure 4: Zendesk’s Capital Resources Create Long-Term StruggleSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings The ability to invest capital into product development and sales and marketing is key in a highly commoditized customer engagement market. Oracle, Microsoft, and Salesforce combined spent over $29 billion in sales and marketing expenses, or nearly 7 times ZEN’s market cap, over the prior 12-month period. These firms also spent nearly $22 billion in research and development, or five times ZEN’s market cap. Without another product/service to build a moat around, ZEN is left fighting the giants in the industry with far less capital and negative margins.ZEN also brings narrower product breadth to battle with larger, more profitable competitors. Salesforce provides other cloud-based products that integrate with software vendors. It also provides exclusive app extensions via the platform’s AppExchange. Microsoft’s Dynamics 365 integrates with Microsoft Office while Oracle’s Service Cloud integrates with its other cloud offerings such as supply chain management or enterprise resource planning. ZEN lacks comparable cloud offerings, and, therefore, brings a weaker value proposition to customers.Even if you believe that ZEN can quickly cut expenses while maintaining high revenue growth, such optimism (and more) is already reflected in the stock price. ZEN’s current valuation implies that it will immediately improve margins and grow revenues to levels far beyond the current size of the entire customer engagement market, as shown below.ZEN shares have benefited greatly from the rise in tech stocks, and in particular, those involved with customer engagement. ZEN is up 110% over the past two years, while the S&P is up just 39%. This outperformance comes despite the firm’s cash losses widening and more competition entering the market. Just this year, ZEN is up 24%, and the price appreciation has pushed it to a level where the expectations baked into the stock price are disconnected from reality.To justify its current price of $48/share, ZEN must immediately improve NOPAT margins to 2% (equal to Salesforce’s margin, compared to -26% in FYE 2017) and grow revenue by 28% compounded annually for the next 20 years. In this scenario, ZEN would be generating over $61 billion in revenue (20 years from now). For reference, ZEN CEO Mikkel Svane noted in the company’s 3Q17 earnings call that the market spends “$12 billion annually on ZEN’s sector.” Essentially, ZEN’s current valuation implies it will grow revenue to more than five times the size of the current market while also drastically improving its profit margins.Even in a highly optimistic scenario, ZEN holds significant downside risk. If we assume ZEN achieves a 12% NOPAT margin (average of competitors with positive margins in Figure 3) and grows revenue by 19% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth only $25/share today – a 48% downside.Each of these scenarios also assumes ZEN is able to grow revenue, NOPAT, and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations embedded in the current valuation are. For reference, ZEN’s invested capital has grown on average $86 million (20% of 2017 revenue) over the past three years.Often the largest risk to any bear thesis is what we call “stupid money risk”, which means an acquirer comes in and pays for ZEN at the current, or higher, share price despite the stock being overvalued. An acquisition could come from an established firm in the customer engagement industry or even another tech giant looking to enter the market quickly. However, as other large tech firms have made acquisitions in recent years, thereby leaving ZEN alone, an acquisition may be less likely now than in the past. Any firm looking to acquire ZEN would be better suited to continue building out their own services rather than imprudently allocating capital and destroying substantial shareholder value in an acquisition.We show below how expensive ZEN remains even after assuming an acquirer can achieve significant synergies.To begin, Zendesk has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest.After adjusting for these liabilities, we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, ZEN is worth less than its current share price.Figures 5 and 6 show what we think International Business Machines (IBM) should pay for ZEN to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. While purely hypothetical, acquiring ZEN would immediately build on its existing Watson Customer Engagement platform while quickly increasing its market presence in the small to medium-sized business market. However, there are limits on how much IBM would pay for ZEN to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or free cash flows (or lack thereof) being acquired.Each implied price is based on a ‘goal ROIC’ assuming different levels of revenue growth. In both scenarios, the estimated revenue growth rate is 31% in year one and 28% in year two, which is the consensus estimate for ZEN’s revenue growth. For the subsequent years, we use 28% in scenario one because it represents a continuation of consensus estimates. We use 35% in scenario two because it assumes a merger with IBM would create additional revenue opportunities through increased distribution and larger sales force.We conservatively assume that IBM can grow ZEN’s revenue and NOPAT without spending anything on working capital or fixed assets beyond the original purchase price. We also assume ZEN immediately achieves a 12% NOPAT margin, which is the average of competitors in Figure 3 with a positive margin, and just below IBM’s 15% margin. For reference, ZEN’s 2017 NOPAT margin is -26%, so this assumption implies immediate improvement and allows the creation of a truly best-case scenario.Figure 5: Implied Acquisition Prices for IBM to Achieve 5% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsFigure 5 shows the ‘goal ROIC’ for IBM as its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) or 5%. Even if ZEN can grow revenue by 33% compounded annually, with a 12% NOPAT margin for the next five years, the firm is worth less than its current price of $48/share. It’s worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 5% ROIC would only be value neutral and not accretive, as the return on the deal would equal IBM’s WACC.Figure 6: Implied Acquisition Prices for IBM to Achieve 10% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsFigure 6 shows the next ‘goal ROIC’ of 10%, which is IBM’s current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to IBM shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the most IBM should pay for ZEN is $19/share (56% downside to current valuation). Even assuming this best-case scenario, IBM would destroy over $2.7 billion by purchasing ZEN at its current valuation. Any scenario assuming less than 33% compound annual growth in revenue would result in further capital destruction for IBM.Zendesk’s senior vice president of worldwide sales resigned from the firm in December 2016. Only eight months later, the firm’s chief revenue officer resigned as well. In this case, the executive had only been with the firm for 16 months, and the stock dropped 9% the day the resignation was announced. Any future upheaval in executive positions at Zendesk would further undermine confidence in management and drop shares once again.Regardless of stability in the c-suite, Zendesk’s cash burn represents a potentially negative catalyst. As noted earlier, Zendesk’s cash on the books in 2017 can only support the firm’s cash burn for just over one year. If cash burn continues at such a rapid pace, investors shouldn’t be surprised if they get diluted by the need to raise additional capital soon. Making matters worse, ZEN’s -$185 million in FCF in 2017 is slightly above the 3-year average of -$183 million. At a time when ZEN needs to continually invest in its products, its resources are dwindling.While we don’t attempt to predict exactly when the market will recognize the disconnect between expectations and reality, such a realization could severely damage investors’ portfolios.Over the past 12 months, 5,000 insider shares have been purchased and 732,000 have been sold for a net effect of 727,000 insider shares sold. These purchases represent less than 1% of shares outstanding.Short interest is currently 3.4 million shares, which equates to 3% of shares outstanding and two days to cover. Short interest rose 3% over the prior month but remains down 3% from its 52-week high. Short interest could rise if execution issues hinder revenue growth or a dilutive capital raise is announced.Our Robo-Analyst technology enables us to perform forensic accounting with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill fiduciary duties. In order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and an accurate shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to Zendesk’s 2017 10-K:Income Statement: we made $9 million of adjustments, with a net effect of removing $1 million in non-operating expense (<1% of revenue). We removed $4 million in non-operating income and $5 million in non-operating expenses.

4037656,102008,2017-01-18T12:03:40-05:00,"Zendesk’s growth expectations have been handicapped by the Street as a result of a sales reorganization in mid-Q3, causing weakness in top-line growth.I believe that investors and the Street have exaggerated the rare, mid-sized salesforce shakeup into an issue that many seem will persist into the majority of 2017.I arrive at a 12-month price target of $28 using a 2017 EV/revenue multiple of 6.","Zendesk's (NYSE:ZEN) shares have continued to underperform since early November (-14%) amidst an environment in which broader indices and sectors like the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) and the Technology SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK) have gained ~6.5% and ~4.3%, respectively. Much of the decline can be attributed to the lack of sufficient internal execution in the third quarter along with a major salesforce restructuring. However, the re-rating of the stock over the past three months appears overdone in my view given that the company continues to scale the product as a complete customer service ecosystem/platform rather than a one-dimensional ticketing system, evidenced by its expansion of Zendesk Explore and Connect.With full-year revenue growing ~65% from 2014/2015 and management guiding for growth north of 48% for FY 2015/2016, I believe Zendesk is mispriced and isn't receiving proper attention from investors and the Street, trading at only 4.8x FY2017 EV/revenue. Assuming management is able to deliver on FY2016 guidance, I believe shares are primed for a rebound as 2017 progresses as top-line growth continues to arrive in at +30%, gross margins continue to expand and an expanding product portfolio enhances the ability to cross-sell products.Worries Over Slim Third-Quarter Top-Line Beat Are OverdoneGiven that Q3 had been (and typically is for SaaS companies) a seasonally strong quarter, the company's top-line surprise of a mere 2% invited a cloud of worry and questions surrounding the sustainability of its core product line and ability to fend off Freshdesk and Desk.com by Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Expanding upon the reorganization of a major portion of the sales team that began in Q3, management described the shift as a change from the ""hunter-farmer"" method to a territory-based system, which caused some turnover and in turn slippage of deals.On a broader business perspective, losing connection with hot and primed leads that are expected to be turned over into ""accounts"" definitely has an effect on corporate guidance and is never healthy when evaluating a business. However, I believe that the attractive and ""sticky"" nature of the Zendesk suite acting as a near necessity for companies as customer service becomes an increasingly large area of focus should aid in keeping the deal pipeline warm for the company and potentially expect the ""slippage"" from Q3 to translate into Q4 sales, making up for the disappointment in Q3. Additionally, the change in sales management/executives should result in lower sales and marketing expenses/COR (cost of revenue) over the next few quarters as we see a gradual decline in employee turnover, which territory-based systems are supposed to mitigate.For reference, sales and marketing expenses came in at ~54% of revenue in Q3, up 200 basis points on a y/y basis likely due to the shakeup. Moreover, one of the more encouraging trends from the quarter was the consistency in share of accounts paying for greater than 100 seats (users), coming in at 33% for the third straight quarter. Given that ZEN's primary audience isn't larger enterprise players, I think the move from 23% of total MRR (monthly recurring revenue) back in September 2014 to 33% signifies that the company has developed a larger brand and product awareness amongst larger corporations and built stability into a conventionally volatile merchant base.Below, I have provided an updated table of metrics for cloud software peers:One of the more encouraging trends from the quarter was the re-acceleration in total merchants signing up for core Zendesk Support, which in turn also drove up total accounts growth. Specifically, total paid accounts were up ~36% on a y/y basis. This trend is encouraging on two fronts: 1) Alleviating any concerns I briefly touched upon earlier regarding a degradation in customer satisfaction, retention, or company ability to attract customers and 2) reinforces the thesis that a turnaround in internal execution will drive revenue growth back to previously seen rates (+30% y/y, +7-8% q/q) given that the core business fundamentals are intact. Readers familiar with my work are likely aware of my preferences of breaking revenue down to the smallest bit, especially when analyzing SaaS models that are traditionally highly profitable (gross) in the long run.Like most firms in the sector, Zendesk provides a rough count on customer metrics and most recently disclosed a paid customer count of over 87,000. Growth in average revenue per customer account (ARPCA) slowed to single digits (7%) y/y compared to 24% in Q3 2015. Once again, I think it's fair to attribute the slowdown due to the operational inefficiencies outlined and is not an issue that I believe will persist given that growth in actual accounts grew, placing all of the focus on internal fixes. Working with a crude forecast, assuming ARPCA growth returns to double digits (10%) in Q4 and surpasses the $1,000 mark, the company will have over 30% of its customer base paying over $400K/year in subscription fees (assuming largest 30%+ customers purchase 100-plus seats). Any growth in accounts in other suite products such as Chat, which saw accounts growth of 27% y/y in Q3, would serve as the upside scenario.(Source: Company filings)Returning to the valuation perspective, I believe that the primary reason Zendesk trades at a discount to its peers and remains punished following the Q3 report revolves around internal execution and lack of confidence in management's ability to re-accelerate growth and reach the $1 billion revenue milestone that was reiterated this past quarter. Moreover, I think that the company still has significant room to expand operating margins notably in the near term as the sales team ""cleanup"" concludes. Specifically, GAAP operating margin only improved by around 1.5% this quarter (y/y), likely again due to the lag in sales the company foresaw with the shakeup. Placing the $1 billion milestone into perspective and assuming FY 2016 revenue comes in at ~$311.4 million (just above guidance range of $309-311 mil.), the company would have to grow its top line by 34%, 36%, 34%, and 31% from 2017-2020, respectively, to fulfill its long-term guidance.Additionally, I believe that as the company maintains a top-line growth rate of over 30% and matures, the primary focus should shift to scalability and focus on cash flow maximization. The model pictured below takes this into account, starting with a gradual reduction in COR, R&D, and G&A (2-3% through 2017) which results in the company turning a profit in Q3 2017. Management recently guided and confirmed its expectations of being FCF positive for FY 2017.(Source: Personal estimates)Valuation and Forecast(Source: Company filings, personal estimates)Above I have modeled the company's income statement through 2020. For the fourth quarter of 2016, I am projecting q/q sequential growth of 9% from Q3 and am within management's guidance range of $86-88 million for the quarter. Additionally, I am marginally above the consensus estimate of ~$87.5 million for Q4. Similarly, I am above consensus by around $1 million for full-year 2016. That said, I project full-year 2016 revenue to come in at ~$311.4 million, slightly above the upper end of guidance.Regarding 2017, I expect q/q sequential growth rates to gradually accelerate from 6% in Q1 to 9% in Q4, allowing time for the new sales organization to settle in. Collectively, I am projecting the company to be profitable on a non-GAAP basis for FY2017 - $0.02/share. Given that the restructuring began sometime in July and assuming that it will take, or would've taken, six to nine months (worst case nine) to complete, I expect that most or all of the inefficiencies that plagued the company starting in Q3 should be behind it/soon will be, allowing it to refocus on growth. Consensus estimates for FY2017 are ~$405 million, around 3% lower than my expectations for the year. In the event that the company guides FY2017 revenue in line with consensus estimates (that have been revised lower since Q3), I'd expect downside to be capped at ~$21/share (applying 4.5x multiple to FY2017 revenue estimates).As mentioned above, I project y/y full-year revenue growth to come in around 30-35% through 2020 which should push the company slightly over its goal at $1.004 billion.Shares took a sharp hit yesterday (Jan. 17) on a downgrade/note from JMP Securities that mentioned a possible disappointment in Q4 billings ($96 million consensus) when the company reports in early February. For clarification, billings are referred to the collection of payments after providing SaaS services.Ultimately, it appears that views on the timeline of Zendesk's sales restructuring vary significantly and have many puzzled, however, I believe that the concerns are nearing exaggeration and many investors are forgetting that the total addressable market for the company's suite is too large to quantify given the necessity of a customer service platform in a digital age. I derive my 12-month target of $28 using a 2017 EV/revenue multiple of 6, representing upside of ~26% from current levels.(Source: Personal estimates)Note: Data as of market close, January 17th, 2017."

Zendesk is one of the more mature SaaS-based service and help-desk offerings on the market today, offering a great client base and technical infrastructure that has helped it drive solid growth in the enterprise market. But it's not a perfect play, with a bit of turbulence in its stock price and a knack for increasing losses to offset revenue gains.While Zendesk has established itself solidly within the enterprise, its implementation approach (which requires more ""hands-on"" effort than we typically like to see from SaaS companies) has left it vulnerable to competitors at the lower-end of the market (think fast-growing rival Freshdesk).With its present valuation and competitive challenges, we feel Zendesk's position in the market is slightly at risk and that it would benefit strongly from a larger partner.

SaaS revenue grew 27% year over year, more than double overall CRM market growth in 2015. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is the largest player with about 20% of the global CRM market. Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) and Freshdesk are two players that specifically compete in the customer support part of the CRM market.Zendesk's FinancialsFirst quarter revenue at Zendesk increased 62% over the year to $68.5 million. GAAP net loss was $27.2 million, or $0.30 per share. Non-GAAP net loss was $7.3 million or $0.08 per share. Analysts expected a loss of $0.10 on revenue of $64 million.At the end of the first quarter, Zendesk had over 75,000 paid customer accounts. Accounts with 100 seats or more grew to 33% of its monthly recurring revenue compared to 25% a year ago.For the second quarter, Zendesk expects to report revenue of $71 million to $73 million, GAAP operating loss of $28 million-29 million, and non-GAAP operating loss of $7.5 million-8.5 million. Analysts expect a loss of $0.08 on revenue of $72.38 million.For full-year 2016, Zendesk expects to report revenue of $300 million-$305 million, GAAP operating loss of $111 million-112 million, and non-GAAP operating loss of $27 million-28 million. Analysts expect a loss of $0.30 on revenue of $303.45 million.Zendesk is targeting to reach $1 billion in annual revenues and profitability by 2020. To reach this goal, it is focusing on three things - elevating its brand, developing or becoming a multi-product company, and further growing its reach into the enterprise. Annual revenue in 2015 was $209 million, up 64%.Zendesk's Enterprise FocusFor its enterprise customers, Zendesk made available in March a machine learning and predictive analytics feature called Satisfaction Prediction. Satisfaction Prediction leverages machine learning to predict how likely a ticket is to receive a good or bad rating, helping organizations take action to ensure positive outcomes. Pinterest, Digitec and Easy Taxi are among the first users of the feature.Zendesk also plans to roll out a messaging product by early 2017. At Facebook's F8 conference in April, it announced a messaging platform to help its customers interact with consumers via social media. Salesforce.com also plans a similar product using Facebook's messenger.At the recent Google I/O conference, Zendesk announced an integration with Google Play that will allow businesses to respond to app reviews and turn them into proactive customer conversations.Zendesk's Management ChangesZendesk has added more members to its management team. Bryan Cox, former CRO at VMware, was appointed as its first Chief Revenue Officer, and Tom Keiser, former CIO of Gap, was appointed as its first Chief Information Officer. Elena Gomez, former senior vice president of finance and strategy at Salesforce, will be replacing Alan Black as its new Chief Financial Officer.Zendesk's stock is currently trading at $24.28 with a market capitalization of $2.23 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $28 this month after UBS initiated coverage with a Buy rating. It hit a 52-week low of $14.38 in February when most CRM stocks plummeted.UBS analyst Brent Thill set a price target of $32 and noted, ""Zendesk does not plan on an acquisition spree to hit its target. Zendesk does plan on selling more products to larger companies and enterprises, expanding from its base of smaller and midsize businesses. Zendesk will likely expand into sales or marketing software.""FreshdeskFreshdesk has recently launched Freshsales, a CRM solution and sales system that includes various capabilities required for sales representatives working in a tough environment. It combines integrated customer and prospect management tracking with, email/phone integration, user behavior tracking, automated lead scoring, a visual sales pipeline, and reporting. The leader in this space is Salesforce.com and Zoho also has a key presence, along with other players like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) that just bolstered its position by acquiring LinkedIn (LNKD). Freshdesk's product is designed for smart phones on iOS and Android operating systems and initially targets small and midsize businesses. Subscription is free for basic version installations of up to 10 users, and more functional versions are priced at $12, $25, and $49 per user per month. The price-point puts them in direct competition with Zoho.Over the past year, Freshdesk has made five acquisitions for undisclosed amounts. These include Airwoot in April 2016 for its Artificial Intelligence technology, Framebench Technologies in February 2016 for its collaboration technology, mobile-first user engagement platform Konotor in December 2015, social recommendation app Frilp in October 2015, and video chat platform 1CLICK.io in August 2015. It is interesting to note that the Airwoot acquisition follows Zendesk's release of the Satisfaction Prediction feature in March. We can expect some competition from Freshdesk in the AI space. Besides Salesforce and Freshdesk, Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM), which recently went public is also a challenger for Zendesk.Freshdesk's FinancialsFreshdesk has over 80,000 customers around the world including 3M, Honda, Bridgestone, Hugo Boss, University of Pennsylvania, Toshiba, Hugo Boss, Good Reads, and Cisco. The focus of the company, however, has been in the small business space. The company forecasts over $40 million in ARR this year. Revenue has doubled in the last year.Freshdesk has raised a total of $95 million from investors including Tiger Global, Accel Partners, and Google Capital. It last raised $50 million in April 2015 at a valuation of $500 million while an earlier round for $31 million valued it at $250 million.Valuations in the private market have been extremely frothy in the past couple of years, and Freshdesk has benefited from that general phenomenon. However, as a 1M/1M company, we hope it sticks to the fundamentals orientation that we espouse as a core philosophy."
3572396,48411,2015-10-14T14:57:23-04:00,"Zendesk is out with news that it has acquired We Are Cloud SAS - a BI solution provider for $45 million in cash and 480,000 shares of Zendesk common stock.I believe this BI acquisition will be a key long-term driver of value expression and visibility for the platform as well as valuation for investors.Continue to be long Zendesk and continue to build a position.","Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN), one of my favorite names in all of tech, has followed through on CEO Mikkel Svane's Q2/15 investor call promises of ""actively building deeper capabilities in data analytics and machine learning on top of this (referring to Zendesk's) massive data asset"" with an announced purchase of We Are Cloud SAS of Montpellier, France, maker of BIME Analytics software. This purchase will have far-reaching, permanent, and value-prop magnifying results as an overlay to Zendesk's existing model. I continue to remain uber-bullish Zendesk despite the equities' inability to move higher since IPO. I'll explain.First, let's note that Zendesk's purchase of We Are Cloud SAS' BI tech, which was the sole purpose of this $45 million cash, 480,000 shares of Zendesk common stock (via RSU's) purchase, was only possible for this young startup because of its absurdly strong balance sheet. I think investors forget just how 1) immature Zendesk is in the scheme of technology things, 2) young the niche that Zendesk is trying to develop is, and 3) much C&CE (pro forma $215.7 million - ~12% of market cap as of last close) are on the books at Zendesk. If you don't think, as I've opined often in previous Zendesk coverage, that there is ample opportunity for Zendesk to rapidly expand/acquire technology/pull growth forward primarily being driven by its cash hoard - there is. This to me is a big reason to accumulate shares now, while they're stuck in the ""IPO pricing zone"", rather than later when the C&CE on the balance sheet and the potential that this adds to the growth modeling at Zendesk is priced in accordingly. I believe that this cash hoard and balance sheet stability/optionality is a big part of the fundamental bull thesis at the customer service platform provider.Moving past the ""how"" and to the ""why"" of the acquisition, realize that Zendesk has built its market cap and its customer base to this point without leveraging a core asset - its data. Sure, Zendesk provides its much-loved, completely unique ""Zendesk Benchmark"" report which provides blinded benchmarking data for its customers to both peers and space. But Zendesk has never had an in-house option for 1) collecting and refining its own data for its own proprietary usage and 2) allowing its customers to collect and refine their own in-house data for their own proprietary usage. That doesn't mean that Zendesk has been without capacity - Zendesk has deep integration with just about every BI platform that I follow and has especially deep integration with Microsoft's Power BI. That said, bringing this solution in-house (Zenndesk also reserved the right to continue selling its new tech as a stand-alone solution - my guess is it will only do this in Europe and APAC) is a game changer and should further solidify already strong retention measures.I believe having its own BI platform that it can tailor perfectly to its product suite will not only make the BI deployment for its customer base more effective but should also increase the already high and all-important switching cost of exiting the Zendesk product loop. This is different than retention. Customer retention refers to what Zendesk does proactively to increase and maintain customer service levels - a ""solution"", that of customer service, Zendesk sells to its customers so you can imagine it's pretty good at this. Switching cost refers to what Zendesk's product suite does to offset any customer unhappiness and what Zendesk's product suite does to increase ARPU and ARPU volume. For instance, it's much harder to move a mortgage from a bank than it is a checking account, regardless of being happy or unhappy as a customer this causes increased retention for the bank. Many banks also leverage this high switching cost product into the deployment of ancillary solutions (such as a free checking account with a mortgage tethered) as well as higher fee generation (for instance, overdraft fees associated with the checking account). As Zendesk is able to increase the data uploaded to its BI solution and the data ""learnings"" that its BI solution has per customer my expectation is that Zendesk sees an uptick to net dollar retention as well as ARPU and ARPU ""volume"" (ARPU volume is a metric unique to Zendesk and is explained here). I just don't see a scenario in which Zendesk isn't able to deploy more product per customer after being able to visibly express its value-prop to a greater degree.Zendesk's purchase of BI tech is both offensive and defensive and I view it as a major coup. Zendesk, as I have recognized and have been following closely, recognized that the BI space is on the verge of a valuation inflection point as well as an importance and relevancy inflection point. Zendesk acquiring BI tech early is a major hit from a management standpoint and I believe will be looked at as genius over the next 12-24 months. I don't anticipate or see the possibility for any negative developments to come from this purchase.I continue to recommend a long position in Zendesk. Good luck everybody."
3982509,98236,2016-06-16T14:52:07-04:00,"Zendesk is the leading independent vendor in what is described as the customer engagement space, a subset of customer relationship management.The company has enjoyed the absolute highest growth rate in its space at 62% and has consistently beat expectations and raised guidance.The company appears to have significant ease of use and rapid time to benefit advantages compared to its competitors.The company has begun to make a significant pivot from selling to small users to embracing an enterprise model. FB Messenger has recently become a platform as well.There is merger-mania in this space, and inevitably, this company will catch some of that buzz.","Zendesk: Is there light at the end of this tunnel?Zen is defined as a religion that emphasizes rigorous meditation packages. I suppose San Francisco is a good home for a company that calls itself Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) although the business was actually started in Copenhagen. I have used the ZEN app occasionally and truth to tell one sometimes really does need meditation skills to avoid extreme displeasure with the app.But then again, despite having worked at or followed IT businesses most of my life, I have a difficult time with so-called personal productivity applications. I find they either waste my time or frustrate me and I need some younger friend or relative to show me how they are to be used properly. Perhaps uniquely amongst the army of SA contributors, I needed personalized instruction in how to use the blue ball to provide a link to sources of information that I use.I was actually able to figure out the use of the bullet point icon without instruction and I considered putting in for an award. So the fact that I have cursed at and chosen to anthropomorphize the ZEN application is really not a good measure of its value to the companies that buy it or the customers that use it.But enough personal musing. There is really only one reason to consider a company like this amongst what might be thought of as a forest of similar solutions. There are portfolio strategies, which might suggest buying a basket of these relatively small, loss-making vendors who populate the spaces of improving customer interaction with websites. For sure, not all of them will be equally successful - it doesn't happen that way and choosing between them at this stage of their evolution is hard to do with so few objective data points. The special claim to fame for ZEN is it has the highest percentage growth rate in the broadly defined space in which it competes.The company is forecast to grow 45% this year and 33% in 2017 although given the performance in Q1 and throughout 2015, I suspect that the reversion to the mean is likely to be slower than the consensus indication. Even the Q2 forecast, which calls for revenue growth of $3.5 million sequentially seems more conservative than is warranted as Q2-2015 showed a $6 million sequential quarterly revenue increase.When I try to write these articles, my focus is on figuring out why a company like ZEN has been a bit more successful in its growth rate than some of the other vendors who are trying to address the same potential customers. And I want to try to understand how long the period of hyper growth can last and finally I pay obeisance to the concept of finding competitive moats.To dispose of the last matter first, it is highly unlikely that someone has made a particular discovery that will change the world and conquer the Zika virus. The product that ZEN offers and the products of many of the other vendors in the broadly defined CRM space, are all about using the web to deliver to ultimate users a more enjoyable and less stressful shopping experience. Most of the parts of these solutions already exist in one form or the other and potential competitors can put the functionality together any way they want.Competitive moats are going to be such things as 1st mover advantage, more efficient ways of targeting buyers, the ability to execute at scale and having a management team that is capable of looking at the landscape holistically. Of course, if those are the attributes of competitive moats, which are all subjective in nature then determining the winners is pretty hard. But that being said, the purpose of this article is to try to use a screen of qualitative factors to determine the suitability of investing in ZEN for tech investors.ZEN - If it not about Meditation, then what is it about?Before I discuss what ZEN is, I have to say what it is not. It is not a company that has turned the corner in terms of profitability and that is probably 18-24 months away. It is not a company with a mature l business model. It is not a company that has paid more than modest attention to GAAP profitability. And it is not a company that has been economical with stock-based comp. This is going to disbar the name from consideration by many readers and investors.The company is cash flow positive with the help of a significant slug of stock based comp. but it is also growing its deferred revenues at a rapid clip. Management has said that it is going to focus on cash flow from operations as a key target it will use in both planning its business and in evaluating results. So do not look for any emphasis on GAAP profitability in the near future.There are observers who believe that a company such as this is doomed to come to economic ruin. The fact is, however, that almost all of the institutions and VCs that invest in this space are doing so with full knowledge of the risks implicit in investing in loss making companies. Since ZEN, and many of its peers do not burn cash, the doom scenario is unlikely.What is harder to call is how long and to what levels, the hyper growth story can continue. Like many other companies in this space, the company has an aspirational model of 20% non-GAAP operating margins sometime after 2020. Just to be clear, such a projection most likely means that the company will not achieve GAAP profitability at its non-GAAP target model. The company's projection is that it will be halfway to its target model by 2020, which implies that non-GAAP break-even is likely at some point in 2018.Zendesk operates within a niche of the broadly defined CRM space. Simply put, its solution is said to ""help bring organizations and their customers closer together."" There are plenty of prospective users who seem to want to get closer to their customers. The company has gone from 0 to a $300 million annual revenue run rate in less than 5 years. So far, there have been no quantifiable signs of a growth slowdown. Q1 showed a sequential revenue increase of $5 million or 8% from Q4. Q4 to Q1 sequential revenue growth in 2015 was 7.5%.At one level, what this company tries to sell is an enhanced form of e-mail focused on interactions between consumers and their vendors. The company's solution tries to improve customer service via easier communication. Just as an aside, the use of which I am frequently guilty, even the simplest e-mails will work if the customers get what they need and the best communications platform in the world is useless if the company from which you are trying to buy can't fulfill your expectations. Needless to say, I have had plenty of pleasure from inadequate customer service regardless of whether or not it was delivered from the ZEN platform.Most Zendesk customers have customized their customer interaction platform. They really do look prettier and more professional and in these days of self-service, prettier and professional is going to be as good as it gets. Needless to say, the product offers loads of analytics and competitive analysis as part of its reporting package. Again, like the most successful companies in this space, Zendesk is building an eco-system and it has 350 apps that can be bought for use with the company's basic product. ZEN has also attempted to integrate its technology with other solutions in this space. For example, Shopify users building their e-commerce platform can readily add Zendesk as part of their shop front to organize their customer service capabilities.In recent quarters, ZEN has pivoted to a degree from emphasizing sales to SMB customers, to sales to enterprises. It is now focused on selling to the SMB customers with a low touch, no touch model and it is going to deploy most of its sales and marketing spend both into branding and into direct sales of large deals to the enterprise market. There were some significant wins in Q1 of major customers although there were no announced 7 figure transactions.Zendesk pricing is based on a modified form of the ""freemium"" model for the SMB space and something quite a bit different for its enterprise customers. There is a pricing tier that is based on a minimal set of functionality for $5/month. Most users are going to wind up spending $49/month per agent, while enterprise users are likely to wind up spending $99/month. The company also offers phone support as an additional product and it has a free product offering. Most users are going to wind up paying $29/month to get useful functionality. There are bunches of add-ons far too numerous to mention in the context of this article. The company's advanced phone product is its most recent ""big thing"" and it was said to have exceeded its forecast in this last quarter.Zopim is a company that enables live chat. For those who haven't used it, live chat is a facility that allows end-users to chat through a keyboard with a customer service agent. It is lots better than being put on hold and it is cheaper for the actual customer since it enhances the productivity of CSRs significantly. In my own experience, most CSRs multi-task and take care of a few customer conversations at the same time.Zopim was acquired by ZEN two years ago and the Zopim functionality is actually embedded in some of the ZEN offerings. Zopim Lite is included in the Zendesk user account. There are many combinations and permutations of pricing that are available to users.The specific market that ZEN serves these days is not particularly large, but certainly large enough for a $300 million revenue company to grow significantly. The basic data on what is called the CEM space is that it is worth about $6 billion/year these days and is growing at 20%/year, one of the higher growth rates in a CRM sub-market.Just how many software competitors are needed to help enterprises to help customers?There are loads and loads of competitors in this space. As I mentioned earlier, evaluating this space is not about the technology per se. It is about developing solutions that are easy for customer service representatives to learn and use. It is about having all of the available communications resources available on a single platform. It is about offering support for all possible mobility platforms.One review amongst far too many I have seen is probably worth noting, ""I evaluated 5 other competing products and chose Zendesk for its reliability and scalability, In addition to exceptional customer service and outstanding training and implementation. The product is beautifully designed and intuitive to use and my team couldn't be more thrilled to have moved from managing cases in Salesforce to Zendesk.""The review highlights the ways a vendor without real technology differentiation can build a very strong customer moat. Reliability and Scalability. Outstanding customer service and outstanding training and implementation. A ""beautiful"" looking product and intuitive to use. Those are excellent components of a secret sauce.This company does have a modest advantage in terms of its rankings by users but almost all of the significant vendors have someone amongst their user base who loves them. Based on the rankings and the commentary that I saw it really is not product functionality or product quality that is going to do much to change market share. ZEN may be best of breed or second best of breed but the rankings are so close that the specifics really do not matter.Gartner recently rated Zendesk in the leader box of its Magic Quadrant which is nice, but nothing that is really earth shattering. There are 5 other vendors in Gartner's leader box and of those CRM is the highest. I would guess that very few prospective customers are making decisions based on whose technology is better. Most of the potential clients are going to make deci8sions based on subjective impressions of competitive solution as well as ""feelings"" of installation and support capabilities. In my opinion, ZEN is going to do just fine in such an environment.The G2 Crowd analysis list more than 50 competitors in the space. One of the principle competitors is a company called Desk.com that was acquired by Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in 2011. At that time, it was called Assistly. Desk is now part of the CRM service cloud so we really do not know how well it is doing. We do know that the service cloud has enjoyed one of the highest growth rates of all of the CRM clouds.Another large company offering in the space is that of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft bought Parture. Parture had been around for some years before the acquisition and it had started to partner with MSFT before the 2014 acquisition.A final name to mention is RightNow. At the time of the acquisition which cost Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)$1.5 billion, RightNow had a leading customer service cloud. At the time of the acquisition, Oracle paid $1.5 billion for the company, which was about 6X the run rate of revenues. RightNow may have been the only public software company that ever called Bozeman, MT home. Today, RightNow is now part of the Oracle Service Cloud and its performance gets lumped in with all of Oracle's SaaS offerings.There has been a significant convergence in the overall space between CEM and all the other functionality needed to work with web based businesses. There clearly are far too many alternatives to supply the same basic solutions. I think consolidation on a massive scale is relatively inevitable. But figuring out who might get consolidated and at what price is something far beyond either my knowledge or skill set.Are there any specific catalysts for the stock? Why buy it now?ZEN shares have been on the typical path of the share price performance of most other IT vendors. The shares made an all-time high of just above $27 in December and then fell 47% to make a low on February 9, 2016. After that, the shares rallied back above their old high where they now stand. The company twice had beat the prior quarterly earnings and revenue consensus over that span.The shares were up the 10% the day after earnings in February and up 4% in May. ZEN's performance over all was more volatile than that of the IGV software-technology index, but over the last 6+ months the index and ZEN got to the same place. The day that ZEN rallied 10% after earnings, the IGV rallied 4%. In May, when ZEN rallied 4%, the IGV showed a 1.5% gain. Earnings mattered, but not all that much-the course of the market and the tech stock market overall, has been far more significant in determining share value changes over the last 6+ months.Clearly, one specific catalyst is going to be merger-mania. CRM, MSFT and ORCL have runners in this race. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a peripheral competitor and could certainly be considered as a prospective purchaser. IBM (NYSE:IBM) has an entry in the space called Silverpop. Silverpop is far less popular and is considered less functional than Zendesk. It would certainly be a useful strategy for IBM to buy its largest direct competitor in the space and it is possible given the fragmentation in the space that anti-trust might not be a major issue.Remedyforce, yet another competitor if one stretches definitions of this space, is owned by BMC, now private. Remedyforce has a far lower rating than does Zendesk and far lower customer satisfaction rating. While there is functional overlap between the two products, for the most part they are sold differently and to different groups of potential customers. I wouldn't be shocked to see Remedyforce/BMC make a bid to acquire Zendesk.There is a pretty extensive list beyond these of potential acquirers. Further afield, but certainly possible would be companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Indeed, FB recently did a deal with ZEN in which FB Messenger can be used as part of an overall ZEN solution.ZEN has a current market cap of $2.5 billion so presumably a deal could be done at $3.5 billion. I do not know if anyone might buy ZEN. I do know that a potential acquisition is likely part of the share price dialogue.At $3.5 billion, the EV/S is beyond the valuation level at which most deals are getting done but in this latest feeding frenzy it is possible that potential consolidators will step up simply to have their own entry in this space and one that is best regarded with the highest growth rate as well. So I would put merger speculation on my list of potential catalysts.There may be some commentators who bewail the current valuations in the software space. There are others who are unhappy that software companies are willing to pay up for companies that don't achieve earnings or a meaningful level of free cash flow and who use lots of stock based comp in their earnings presentation.At the end of the day, those concerns, valid though they may be in the abstract, are more or less like King Canute lecturing the tide. The potential consolidators know all about stock based comp and cash flow. This would be a small acquisition if it happened so the dilution would be scarcely noticeable to many. But more important, with interest rates so low and liquidity so flush, companies find a strong incentive to buy operating assets as opposed to paper.The valuations in the M&A space are a strong reflection of what happens when the Fed and other central banks become concerned enough such that ignore parts of their mandates. Governments and banks, even in countries that lack truly representative institutions, are going to be more responsive to threats to growth than towards potential threats of inflation. As the saying goes, don't fight the Fed, and decrying high valuations for takeovers is a bit like that-or so I think.I might put speculation about the earnings release for the current quarter. Most managements these days have proven to be quite restrained in giving forward guidance. They believe that the macro environment is such that they do not wish to extend themselves. The current revenue estimates and their concomitant earnings estimates for Q2 and likely beyond, appear on their face to be designed to be beaten.The sequential growth forecast simply is less in dollars than the company has been achieving despite the continued ""investments"" in both product and in sales capacity. So, the potential for a beat is pretty high and the market may, to a greater or lesser degree, be anticipating a beat.What might happen, however, is that management speaks a bit more forcefully than it has to date with regards to a path to profitability and to significant cash flow generation. So far, Mikkel Svane, company CEO has said that ""we have set an ambitious goal to reach $1 billion in revenues by 2020 and expect to reach profitability along the way to that goal."" Mr. Svane has also spoken that ""this shows our disciplined approach to scaling our business"" in referring to the 780 basis point improvement in operating margins on a year on year basis posted in Q1.To reach $1 billion in revenues by 2020 is going to require changes in trajectory from those that are part of the current consensus. Just simple math is such that the company would have to have a CAGR of 35% between now and 2020 to achieve its goal. Usually CAGR's re comprised of higher growth in the initial periods and lower growth over time-law of large numbers.The company's current expense ratios are such that there ought to be substantial leverage, particularly at a sustained 35% growth rate. Last year, the company's expense ratios included sales and marketing at 54.5%; R&D at R& D at just below 30% and G&A at 23%. If the company management really wants to exert ""discipline"" in their spending it isn't that hard to imagine a scenario in which profitability comes sooner and reaches higher levels than is currently anticipated. And that, if it is even hinted at, would be a significant catalyst to drive these shares. At the very least, this company is in transition to a more enterprise focus with larger deals. And the company is focused on a ""low touch, no touch"" model to acquire small business accounts. Those two items alone might help improve the S&M expense ratio.ValuationI think that it hardly going to come as a surprise to readers to find that valuations for ZEN are high. In a very low growth environment, there is a premium for growth. In a world that has seen a marked acceleration in consolidation activity within the IT space, investors - or read speculators if you prefer - will speculate about the probability of this vendor or that vendor being consolidated.Is SHOP a better consolidation than ZEN. Not something that can be readily determined. Is ZEN a better investment based on some DPV analysis than HUBS. It really is a function of what kind of growth rate assumptions that are made. HUBS has a consensus full year estimate for 42% growth and ZEN has a 45% estimate for full year growth. Neither number is likely to prove all that sacrosanct.I expect that both vendors will produce more upside surprises. SHOP is a clear winner in the growth rate derby for this year at 69% and for next year as well. If pushed, I think SHOP is a better value but not by some huge disparity. There isn't such a yawning gap in valuation between these three vendors that recommending one compared to the other is some straightforward quantitative exercise.For the record, ZEN currently has an EV/S of 7.5X based on the 2016 revenue consensus estimates of 12 analysts. For 2017, the ratio is 5.6X. The company has no earnings and hence there is no P/E estimate. It would be a significant achievement, but one that seems realizable for the company to reach non-GAAP profitability by the end of 2017. ZEN is modestly cash flow positive at the present time.It generated $20.2 million in operating cash although it spent more than that on stock based comp. Free cash flow was essentially zero in 2015. The company was essentially break even on a free cash flow basis in its Q1 which compares to the year earlier cash burn of about $10 million in Q1-2015.ZEN does not forecast any cash flow measures. The company is now forecasting a GAAP net loss of $111-$112 million compared to $84 million in 2015. With stock based comp forecast to increase to $80 million, compared to $52 million last year, it seems likely that estimates for cash flow and free cash flow will show moderate progress when compared those metrics in 2015. So, a valuation based on free cash flow yield will not be terribly useful at this point. This is an early-stage company and traditional valuation metrics aren't going to work.Summing Up!These shares are not for everyone as I have been at pains to explain. But the combination of rapid growth, a path to profitability and a market space that is ripe for consolidation make this an investment that well may produce positive alpha."
3243966,48411,2015-06-08T15:05:37-04:00,"ZEN gave an excellent presentation at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Technology Conference which was aided quite nicely by analyst Kash Rangan.ZEN CEO Mikkel Svane talked target markets, a call center vertical and growth creep.BACML analyst Kash Rangan gave personal anecdotes on what he's hearing around the industry in regards to ZEN.Continue to be long ZEN.","Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) CEO Mikkel Svane and Bank of America analyst Kash Rangan put on an excellent show at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Technology Conference (via Sentieo.com) and I think both did an excellent job in further telling the total ZEN story. This was a rare conference where the analyst might have contributed as much as the presenter, which again you won't see every day.Svane answered the questions in his usual color while Rangan spoke on his feedback that he's received about ZEN from current ZEN customers and potential ZEN investors - an important segment to hear from as ZEN has been range bound for quite some time.These were my key takeaways from the conference.ZEN and call centers …Mikkel Svane:So this isn't a vertical that I first think of when I think ZEN even though I've personally been phone serviced by a call center using ZEN. What I'm saying is this is sort of an under the radar reason to own ZEN that I don't think the market focuses (or myself) enough on. But apparently ZEN does as it is looking to expand its platform and partnerships.I cover Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) and the transition going in the call center space is incredible and happening fast. ZEN, as well as the SAAS providers directly servicing the niche, is well-positioned to capitalize on this shift considering it is an agnostic provider of quasi-OTT software. It doesn't care if the eventual winner is an established enterprise like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) or a newcomer like FIVN. It wins either way. I think that the evolution in the call center space is something that is overlooked and it's a reason to consider buying ZEN.ZEN the enterprise solution? Or ZEN the SMB solution? ...Mikkel Svane:Or neither? I've been following the ZEN story since its IPO and slowly but surely ZEN has been overtly shifting into its current enterprise targeting self. At least I thought. But what Svane highlights is exactly what we always knew about ZEN. That it's solution is omni-channel. That its solution services my personal platform the same way it services its global enterprises. The great thing about ZEN's technology is that it's easy enough for me to implement into my Wordpress hosted website but sophisticated enough to service Fortune 500 companies.And as Svane clearly states, the company loves this because who knows what innovative, small company - maybe they're a social network called ""theFacebook"", could become the next 8,000 support agent enterprise. This, to me, is hugely important to understand about the story here. That ZEN will be the beneficiary of the ""transactional"" smaller SMB market while proactively focusing on the enterprise market, sure, but that ZEN should realize (presumably) some ""growth creep"" from its ""innovators"" on the SMB side growing up. That's huge guys and it matters.Zen's growing reputation …Kash Rangan:Guys I'm not the smart money. I try my best but I'm not the smart money. But I can assure you this, based on my conversations with asset managers and the ""smart money"" uniformly the idea is that ZEN is going to be a huge powerhouse name in the future - think salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM).What ZEN offers, how it offers it, who it targets, its global infrastructure, its uniqueness, its management - all of this matters. ZEN really is a one of kind opportunity in a space that desperately needs what it offers. Everything I've written since shifting my stance on the company, when I had that ""aha"" moment and realized what ZEN is, has been in an effort to better explain that to my followers.We are currently in an era of mimicking and copycatting - ZEN is definitely not doing that and I don't believe it can be done to ZEN. Some will say, ""Dallas look at HappyFox, JIRA, and Freshdesk"", but those companies don't have the name brand, the product portfolio, the management, and the access to the public funding markets (which matters more from an acquiring talent standpoint in this reference).ZEN is unique and ZEN is differentiated. People are starting to take notice.ZEN's differentiation …Kash Rangan:This sums it up so I won't elaborate much on it other than to say, again, ZEN is doing things that its smaller competitors are not doing. I didn't even consider using the competitors for the launch of my personal website and it wasn't because I'm long ZEN but because I have visions of grandeur of eventually needing the full suite that ZEN offers. That's it. I think that in itself is what wins ZEN an overwhelming portion of its SMB business.ZEN stays impressive …I was thoroughly impressed with ZEN's presentation at the BACML as I always am. ZEN continues to example itself as one of the better SMB/enterprise solutions to own and my guys own quite a bit of it.I think ZEN's pays off bigtime over the next few quarters.Good luck everybody."
3429396,20521,2015-08-11T15:23:31-04:00,,"According to a recent Gartner report, the global customer relationship management (CRM) software market is estimated to have grown to $23.2 billion in 2014, up 13.3% from $20.4 billion in 2013. SaaS accounted for almost 47% of the market driven by organizations of all sizes looking for easier to deploy and faster ROI alternatives to modernizing legacy systems, implementing new applications, or providing alternative complementary functionality. Billion-Dollar Unicorn club member Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) as well as rival Freshdesk are the new generation players riding on this trend.Zendesk's FinancialsZendesk last week reported second quarter revenue of $48.2 million, up 63% y-o-y, beating the street estimate of $46.34 million. Net loss was $21.5 million or $0.25 per share. Non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.08, ahead of the estimated loss of $0.11 per share. Although the company remains unprofitable, gross margin was 66.5%, up from 60.2% a year ago, and operating expenses increased by just 35.4% year over year.The outlook also was positive, surpassing analyst expectations. Zendesk expects third quarter revenue between $51 million and $53 million, up by about 53%. Full-year revenue is expected to be $198 million to $201 million, compared to the street estimate of $194.2 million.Zendesk's Changing Customer ProfileAt the end of the second quarter, Zendesk had more than 1,000 employees and 60,000 paid customer accounts. Over the past year, enterprise has been a key focus for Zendesk. In the enterprise segment of organizations with 500 or more employees, Zendesk landed several new customers including Booking.com, CenturyLink, STA Travel and Viacom's Kids & Family Group of Nickelodeon. CEO Mikkel Svane attributed the success in their enterprise customer acquisition strategy to their BPO channel.Customers with 100 or more seats now represent 27% of their monthly recurring revenue vs. 23% last year. Since the beginning of 2014, they have signed more than 150 contracts with an individual value of more than $50,000 annually.During the quarter, Zendesk focused on improving their LiveChat product's capabilities for larger teams and organizations, and by the end of the quarter they had landed more than 215 Premium chat accounts.Zendesk also is expanding their global footprint and 44% of revenues came from outside the United States. The number of languages and regional variations for customer service agents has doubled to 28 since its IPO. For end users, they support more than 40 languages on their customer service platform.Following the results, Zendesk's stock surged and is currently trading at $22.41 with a market capitalization of $1.93 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $28.20 in October last year.FreshdeskLike Zendesk, 2010-founded Freshdesk also is looking beyond SMBs. Their customer list now includes names like Sony Pictures, Cisco, Honda, 3M, Hugo Boss and Good Reads. They also are expanding globally. They have around 350 employees and have shifted their headquarters to San Fransisco, have an office in London, and are about to open another in Australia.Reports show that Freshdesk has grown bookings more than three times in the past several years. They have doubled their number of customers to more than 40,000 customers in the past year but do not give the breakup of their paid and unpaid customers.They are estimated to have recorded revenues of $10 million in 2013. In June 2014, they had raised $31 million at a valuation of $250 million. Their last round of funding was held in April when they raised $50 million from their existing investors, Tiger Global leading and Accel Partners and Google Capital pitching in. Valuation was undisclosed but analysts estimated that the round valued them at ""mid-to-high hundreds of millions.""The company plans to use the funds to scale the business and invest in the product in a lean manner, rather than burning the money in building a costly sales and marketing organization. Their main focus is SMBs and they use in-bound marketing campaigns to keep costs down."
3448246,48411,2015-08-18T10:53:00-04:00,Zendesk remains an excellent long-term hold in the tech space.I appreciated the quarterly update given that Zendesk displayed key metric improvements.Zendesk also noted that it might be looking to leverage machine learning and data capture to improve its platform or monetize its data assets.Continue to be long Zendesk.,"Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) had a great second quarter. I continue to be confident in the name despite owning shares and having nothing to show for it. I'm not quite sure what the market is reluctant about this story but I'm not reluctant to hold for the long haul. Zendesk continues to display growing health with excellent rates of growth, posting 63% revenue growth for Q2 Y/Y (up a whopping 14% sequentially) and excellent rates of retention. As of the end of the second quarter Zendesk's dollar-based net expansion rate, a non-GAAP measure and key metric for the company, was a strong 122%. This is up 300 bps from a revised figure from Q1/15 and indicative of a very happy customer base - myself included.And that last part, the fact that somebody running a small startup can use and see instant value-add from Zendesk is a large part of what makes the Zendesk story so buyable. Zendesk as a platform is universally appealing regardless of company size and the platform is universally scalable. What this means is that Zendesk essentially offers the same platform to me, owning a small digital property, as it does to its largest enterprise customer. Of course, I don't have use for all of Zendesk's services (at least not the entire suite) as some of its enterprise customers do. But that doesn't mean that I won't at some point. If I happen to grow into more use cases, which I intend to, you better believe that's going to benefit Zendesk.The fact that Zendesk doesn't have separate core platforms based on size is a huge take rate multiplier in my opinion. It's also a huge reason the company continues to see its ARPU and total ""ARPU volume"" rise Y/Y for comparable periods on a cohort basis. I was just on the Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) Q2/15 investor call and heard real-time from Marketo management how not having a scalable platform is costing a major competitor business to Marketo. This functionality of the core platform without scale limitations has provided Zendesk with organic ""growth creep"" tailwind to its growth rates according to my modeling. Put simply, higher ARPU being driven by underlying customer expansion - growth of the customer's business, although it's hard to back out. But be careful to separate what I'm referencing from actual growth in ARPU as traditionally defined. What I'm referring to is a five-seat customer scaling up to a 100-seat customer at the same ARPU (but more ""ARPU"" by volume). This dynamic as a whole is what makes Zendesk great and as a whole is what was displayed during Q2 reporting.Zendesk CEO Mikkel Svane made quick note of the fact that the company has experienced and should continue to experience uplift from SMB customer growth (in terms of the customer's business growing, as described above):Zendesk also is attacking its market from all directions. It captures SMBs in large size and it's beginning to capture more and more of the enterprise market. It's also capturing customers of all varieties on a global basis - something that I've detailed development by development in coverage for Seeking Alpha. Zendesk is not only expanding its global sales footprint, it's also expanding its global infrastructure base. All of that was evident in Q2 reporting in a big way. 56% of Zendesk revenue was derived from customers in the Unites States while 44% of revenue came from customers internationally - I expect this figure to remain roughly the same on a percentage basis but for international revenue to become more diversified by country.As for larger customers, Zendesk customers that have a 100 or more seats with the company, a hugely important segment the company has targeted to drive forward growth, have continued to grow. This group now represents 27% of monthly recurring revenue as of the end of Q2 versus 23% as of the end of Q2 of last year. That 400 bps improvement might seem small at face value but consider that just four reporting periods has passed as well as the fact that Zendesk is just now ramping into enterprise optimization. I believe this figure has much, much room for improvement in the near term. Also take into account that Zendesk just launched in 1H what could be one of its core products - LiveChat. LiveChat in itself just rolled out a new feature for managing multiple brands within a company - obviously this has been tailored for larger companies. So, expect accelerated rates of growth from the large customer segment in the immediate term.All told I remain incredibly enthusiastic about the progress at Zendesk and I remain as bullish today as I was at initiation. Zendesk has plenty of cash to drive growth long into the future and stands to benefit from continuing to invest that cash into new, disruptive tech capacity. CEO Svane gave investors some insight into what might be coming next from the company on the investor call in stating:Machine Learning has been hot recently with companies like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) all making acquisitions in the niche. Zendesk has access to hundreds of millions of data points, especially with its integration to Facebook's ""Businesses on Facebook"" that it can use to better its platform and take potentially towards monetization efforts. I'm excited to see how this develops going forward. Considering the above mentioned $255.7 million in C&CE on the books at Zendesk the potential developments are essentially endless. I'll wait for a directional update from the company before speculating too much.I continue to like Zendesk from the long side.Good luck everybody."
3980778,52382,2016-06-09T13:17:47-04:00,"Long-term prospects of the SaaS-based help desk software industry may be great, but Zendesk does not look like the best way to monetize the trend.Expectations are high, but the increasing competition, including from startups like Freshdesk, cannot be shrugged off anymore.Valuation reflecting the acquisition premium, while the business is making operating losses and may find it difficult to grow into high expectations.","Even though Zendesk (ZEN) is a SaaS (software as a service) based help desk solution provider, the market, looking at the rich valuation and an equally impressive stock price movement, seems to be focusing on just the SaaS part, a business model which enjoys a valuation premium for the easy scalability, high growth due to wider customer adoption and high operating leverage.With communication channels of customer and employee requests proliferating, and the need for a faster and efficient response mechanism growing, the help desk industry is definitely undergoing a shift. SaaS-based solutions and the solution providers, including Zendesk, stand to benefit from this shift, but the hope that Zendesk might be the best way to play and monetize the trend seems misplaced with the changing industry and business fundamentals.Good market environment is helpfulImage source: ZendeskThere is no doubt the sector continues to enjoy strong tailwinds and the company has been able to show very impressive topline growth, even though the recent revenue growth of close to 60% per year was slower than almost 90% growth seen by the business over the last few years.Strong topline growth, the broader trend towards offering integrated unified communication tools as a service, and a new CFO from Salesforce support the long thesis that relies and thrives on similarities between Zendesk and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), which competes with Zendesk, but derives a small portion of revenue from similar offerings. This similarity with Salesforce has been a great help to the company to attract a rich valuation premium.The long thesis is overlooking the headwinds that are gaining strengthThe competition is real and rising, but more importantly it is not just coming from Salesforce, even though the Street so far has focused mostly on Salesforce. Salesforce, as one the largest players in the space, controls almost one-fifth of the global CRM market, rather than focusing on just help desk offerings like Zendesk. Salesforce did lose some ground to Zendesk, but with the fast ramping desk.com, which is focused on catering to the SMB market, the company might be in a better position to compete, and as for the market for cloud software for large companies, Salesforce continues to have a dominant position.Another major player that is starting to gain serious traction is the India-based Freshdesk, which is not just growing strongly but is backed by equally strong investors, enabling the company to compete effectively. Freshdesk, gaining recognition for better pricing, ticket management, reporting and security, is fast getting recognized among SMB customers and, as expected, is attracting some high-profile endorsements as well.Besides Salesforce and Freshdesk, there are some names that are gaining traction or have the potential to pose a serious challenge down the road. These are solutions like Jira from Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM), which right now does require some adaptation and training compared to Zendesk that requires barely any setup, but the company has a deep understanding of chat functionality and project management, or players like Olark, Helpshift, Freshservice and numerous other small players.No doubt, the company is also trying to move up the value chain, as reflected in the recent acquisition of the data analytics company BIME analytics that may help the company expand functionalities like satisfaction prediction or real-time data visualizations, but these add-ons may also increase the need to spend on acquisitions for the company that continues to have negative operating margins, almost -10% during the latest quarter, thus increasing the dilution risk.Long-term model very farImage: Zendesk results presentationThe company is far away from the targeted long-term model, but the stock is trading near a 52-week high, highlighting the acquisition premium included in the stock, but even if one considers the recent acquisition of Demandware (NYSE:DWRE), which was offered a 56% premium or 9-10x EV/sales, Zendesk seems expensive, trading at more than 9.5x EV/revenue and is expected to deliver negative earnings for this year and next, unlike Demandware."
3203446,48411,2015-05-21T14:18:24-04:00,"ZEN had a great non-financial and financial quarter.ZEN announced growth, product introduction, product success, and enterprise progress.In my opinion ZEN is one of the most attractive SMB/enterprise solutions on the market.Continue to be long ZEN.","Despite being stuck in a very tight trading channel I continue to be a raging Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) bull and I find the company to be one of the most attractive SMB/enterprise solutions in the market - right there with salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) which has been the subject of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other buyout rumors as of late.I echo ZEN CEO Mikkel Asger's thoughts on the changing customer service and CRM environment in that we are no longer in the (disgusting I might add) transaction rampant, transaction focused, transaction compensated economy of the late-80's to mid-2000's. We are now in an environment where the focus is on retention and lifetime customer value - something that positions SMB/enterprise solutions as premium assets. Again, I think ZEN is one of the most attractive available.ZEN management very smartly realizes this as well and have positioned the company to do two very important things: sprint into growth as fast as possible; and sprint into growth as fast as possible while moving up-market. That's right - I've been trying to focus readers who follow ZEN on the fact that the company has been making less and less subtle moves into positioning itself as more an enterprise solution provider than SMB. Of course SMB will for the mid-term remain a meaningful part of the ZEN model, that's how it built its base of revenues and I'm sure it will do well to retain those SMB's, but I think ZEN is now full throttle headed into enterprise. That's a good thing for longs.The more enterprise business that ZEN can pick up and the more quarters ZEN can get on the books of retaining that ZEN business the higher the sticker price that will be attached to the ZEN business. Pretty simple to understand.This was a big focus on the Q1/15 investor call as management is, I think, giving the markets and investors one last call as a lead in before the company just overtly commits to its enterprise focus (if you don't think it did that on this call already):The fact that I follow ZEN so closely might skew my version of the above excerpts and how to read into them but I just don't think that this is that subtle a message to the markets. Still, I think next quarters call mentions SMB less than this one and so on and so on. Again, this is a good thing for longs - moving upmarket with ZEN's technology certainly won't hurt.As for the quarter itself, ZEN largely posted a blowout. Another one.In regards to non-financials ZEN closed the quarter with 57,000 paying customers, showed 25% of total revenues from customers with 100 seats or more - up 400 bps Y/Y, announced that Embeddables have been deployed to over 3,000 accounts (development tools that allow organizations to embed live chat into mobile apps), and that it launched a ""new proactive, a data driven recommendation engine"" that provides ""key benchmarking data including the metrics like first apply time, resolution time and customer satisfaction"" to administrators. Obviously a huge non-financial quarter.Spending a bit more time on the Embeddables and the ""proactive solution"", Embeddables stand to be more and more important part of the ZEN revenue ecosystem as apps and mobile device (read: tablet specific apps) proliferate. As mobile is used more and more frequently for solving customer service issues (see: Facebook's ""Businesses on Messenger"" - a platform that partnered with ZEN) having the capacity to address customer service in-app is going to become a necessity. ZEN is way ahead of the curve here and stands to be a leader in the niche. I can't wait for this product to show progress down the line.The ""proactive solution"", which has yet to be named publicly, stands to benefit retention (which is already good) in that administrators will know how they rank against peers in the industry and also be given actionable recommendations to improve performance. How ZEN plans to do this is beyond the scope of my current understanding but I'll update readers as soon as I know. Still, think of the possibilities and the readily apparent value add this brings to an administrator. I think this will become a bigger deal than I'm initially thinking but we'll have to see. Regardless, it's yet another power addition to ZEN's portfolio.From a financial standpoint ZEN's performance was excellent. ZEN posted 68% Y/Y revenue growth in the face of some billing mix, showed 46% of revenues coming from international (non-US), showed 50% TTM Asian market growth with 4000 paying customers at Q1 conclusion, posted a 190 bps improvement to non-GAAP gross margin, and showed some leverage to non-GAAP operating margin both Y/Y and sequentially. Importantly, ZEN closed Q1 with $264 million in C&CE as well so it is well funded and ready to stay aggressive with growth - including acquisitions.All told I thought the quarterly report and the in depth follow on call were brilliant and quite productive to the bull case. I continue to recommend a long position in ZEN on all durations. Big things are ahead.Good luck everybody."
3227576,48411,2015-06-01T14:57:58-04:00,"ZEN had yet another great presentation at the Credit Suisse Disruptive Technology Conference.ZEN detailed its easy-to-understand solution but also teased the room with news of a new predictive analysis solution to be deployed soon.This solution, from what we know about it, should fit perfectly into the broader ZEN suite.I also believe this solution will help sell ZEN ancillary services chat and embeddables - a good thing for those long the stock.Continue to own ZEN.","Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) had yet another insightful, easy to understand, well done presentation at the Credit Suisse Disruptive Technology Conference and again this time it was to key industry analyst and institutions. I continue to recommend a long position in ZEN and continue to view it as one of the best SMB/enterprise solutions in the market (it's also one of my favorites both personal and in recommendations).ZEN, with such an easy story to tell already, always seems to execute well in front of a crowd which is a large reason that the analyst community is calling for such large increases to pricing to reach fair value. ZEN has 4 BUY ratings, 3 HOLD ratings and price targets ranging from 9% higher (the bear case) to 39% higher (the bull case) with the mean and median price target (the base case) sitting at ~$29/share (25% higher). That type of overwhelming bullish sentiment doesn't happen overnight and it doesn't happen without the combination of a great product and a great management team - ZEN has both.ZEN made sure to reiterate its core value prop and its core competency at the presentation in stating that its two jobs as a company were to keep things simple for the SMB/enterprise customers and to bring those customers closer to their customers. Why? Because we're in a shifting economy that ever more cares about lifetime customer value rather than immediate transactional value and that requires great, scalable, and repeatable customer services experiences. ZEN SVP of Product Development Adrian McDermott elaborated:ZEN is helping in that in a big way and definitely stays true to its ""simple first"" focus, I can attest to this on the buyside and the sellside of the technology itself within my consulting business. The platform is incredibly simple. But ZEN is also going to be helping out, and this is recent for the platform, in other ways as well.ZEN has will soon deploy a ""machine learning model"" that provides ""satisfaction prediction"" and I think that this an incredible idea that, if done right, should be even more incredible in execution. Again, McDermott was able to give just enough detail to keep us wanting more:This capability should fit perfectly, not just nicely but perfectly, into the broader suite of products offered by ZEN (not inclusive of ZEN's Facebook Messenger offering which I consider almost like a stand-alone company), which has zero wasted motion as a suite. I also think that this will lend itself well to selling ancillary products chat and embeddables if the customer wanting this predictive analysis product doesn't have the other two. I just think that this analysis product will bring so much ""sticky"" selling as it simply makes sense to have more of the suite for the analysis to draw from and for the analysis to be acted on - essentially having the data is useless without the deployment tools.That said, for a company growing so quickly and for a company that has seen both its enterprise penetration increase (500 bps Y/Y as defined by ZEN) and plans to be operational cash flow positive on the full year I think this means good things for its stock price. ZEN shares have traded in a really tight range dating back to September 2014 even on news of blowout quarters, Facebook partnerships, an upmarket move to enterprise, etc.I think this product goes a long way into helping the market ""get it"" and frankly with ZEN's global expansion I think this predictive analysis capability makes ZEN that much more of an acquisition target. The big buzzy tech acquisition being speculated has been salesforce.com, Inc. but I think that ZEN should be the real above the fold marquee name being thought about based on what it's currently being valued at and what it could be. I think there's plenty of runway left for ZEN to be the defining name in SAAS customer service and I think it will eventually show to deliver.Continue to be long ZEN and continue to enjoy the ride.Good luck everybody."
3014156,48411,2015-03-19T13:27:14-04:00,ZEN's ~$160 million raise provides it all the tools its needs to make a serious run at becoming a global enterprise player.ZEN has spent the last two quarters setting up its pieces globally and this raise is the final piece now set in motion.ZEN should see marked equity price increase in 2015 as its initiatives all come together.Consider a ZEN position for the mid-term.,"Zendesk, Inc. (NYSE:ZEN) is now more than ready to make a serious run at the enterprise space with its announced pricing of its follow on offering. I opined just two weeks ago how ZEN was setting up the chess pieces to become a global player in the space with its international and infrastructure expansions detailed in previous PR's. This to me is simply the next natural step in what should be the early innings of a focused effort to scale-up. I remain bullish ZEN's mid-term story and will assess my ownership with each quarter's progress.Now, ZEN gave the canned ""use of proceeds"" description in its S-1 filing associated with this raise but with plenty of case and cash equivalents (C&CE) on its balance sheet, substantially manageable contractual obligations in the near-term, and multiple years worth of all-in cash burn (operational plus investment) funding visibility in front of it this raise most certainly will be used for expansion. Regardless of whether by acquisition or further infrastructure expansion longs have to be enthused that ZEN is now fully loaded and ready to aggressively attack the task at hand:The task will not be easy either so having the tools and the ability to spend with major enterprise competitors is paramount to being able to compete. I believe this raise which will net ZEN a whopping ~$160 million prepares it to do just that.ZEN might also be able to use a portion of these proceeds to create trickle down synergies should it make smart and opportunistic acquisitions. A good example would be ZEN's prior acquisition of Zopim. Zopim was acquired, in my opinion, to gain access to the Asian markets and also was an acquisition almost exclusively geared at gaining enterprise traction. It obviously, as detailed in previous calls with management, has achieved both of these goals but it also has had the unintended benefit of helping drive SMB adoption of the ZEN platform. ZEN's account growth and dollar based expansion rates have both performed beautifully with account growth most notably reflecting the platform capability expansions brought on by Zopim:So in summary I'm more optimistic than ever about the mid-term prospects of ZEN and believe it should see a marked uptick in share price in 2015. I think ZEN has spent the last two quarters setting up pieces that should allow it to begin to take opponents pieces off the board. Normally I'm not a big fan of having a spread out expansion plan, meaning trying to take on too many initiatives at once (regional expansion, infrastructure implementation, taking on a new space (enterprise), making acquisitions, etc.) but ZEN has been able to execute. Having been able to pull this rare feat off successfully I believe ZEN should be considered for a mid-term long position.Good luck everybody."
3079016,48411,2015-04-17T17:16:54-04:00,"ZEN is slowly shaping into an enterprise solution provider.ZEN's Zopim Premium offering should be able to drive incremental near-term revenues, increase ""ARPU"", and increase retention - all good things for shareholders.Continue to be long ZEN.","Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) continues to make progress into reshaping itself into the dominant enterprise solution provider in its space. With its announcement of an upgraded Zopim Live Chat solution built specifically for enterprise teams this initiative certainly took one step forward.ZEN's Zopim-based now suite of services positions it well to continue to capitalize on both the rapid growth of mobile devices and the deeper acceptance of live-chat as a medium for customer service delivery. In its PR announcing the new product Zopim detailed research by Forrester that shows ""online chat adoption among U.S. online adults has significantly risen in the last five years -- from 38% in 2009 to 43% in 2012 to 58% in 2014"". The continuation of this trend is a near certainty in my opinion as the general populous ages/evolves into one that is more and more heavily weighted to one that was introduced to technology and communicating via technology at a young age. The shift in customer service expectation to one that is less expecting of customer service issues to be handed by a ""real person"" to one that expects to have customer service issues handed via text should only act as a tailwind to Zopim suite service demand.That said, I believe the newest iteration of software (Zopim Premium Live Chat) is well-built to piggy back off of years of competitors' prior solution trial and error. For instance, ZEN's upgraded offering includes real-time monitoring of key metrics (including chat volume), visitor experience, agent ""performance"", and provides a dashboard for improved performance during peak periods of in-chat volume. Other key features include new integration and customization options, 24/7 live chat support, and the ability to restrict agent logins by location for enhanced security. These features blend Zopim Premium Chat into a comprehensive solution.Finally, ZEN is offering the solution as a stand-alone product or as an upgrade to existing accounts. It should also be noted that 1) ZEN existing accounts can upgrade to Premium proactively without needing to request and upgrade and 2) ZEN is offering (at least currently) trials to Premium - which should go a long way into upselling its existing book. I look at Premium, the method of upgrades (primarily the ease of upgrading), and the risk free trial option as reasons that ZEN should experience 1) an at least incremental increase to revenues in the near-term from both organic and external Premium market capture, 2) an increased ""ARPU"" from a client standpoint, and 3) higher levels of retention (which are already quite high).All told this is just one more reason to be bullish the long-term ZEN story. I continue to own ZEN and continue to recommend a long position."
3028956,48411,2015-03-25T18:02:05-04:00,"ZEN's announcement today that it is partnering with FB to help facilitate FB's new ""Businesses on Facebook"" initiative is huge for many reasons.This positions ZEN as a mid-term M&A option for FB as well as plenty of other companies.I also believe this partnership will lead to massive amounts of operating leverage for ZEN as it's able to decrease S&M spending in the immediate term.I expect ZEN to have a huge 12-18 months in front of it when it comes to revenue growth and customer acquisition.Today will be remembered as a defining moment in the history of ZEN, be long this moment and ride the ZEN wave.","How awesome does Zendesk's (NYSE:ZEN) Zopim acquisition look now that it has announced that Zopim chat can facilitate businesses' ""Businesses on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)"" participation? I mean, really? As if making it convenient for the company to have Asian exposure and for the company to launch its Far East expansion wasn't enough, Zopim just secured a partnership with a company that should now be considered a potential buyer longer term. Heck, it should be considered a buyer in the mid term or however long it takes ZEN to prove its competence in this matter. Oh yeah, that company is Facebook.That's right. ZEN's Zopim chat platform through an integration with Facebook Messenger will begin allowing businesses to chat with customers via Messenger. You can imagine with FB's Messenger user base of over 600 million people that this makes ZEN an immediate must own and long-term hold. By the way, that's as of today. That's not including the potential merging of FB's Messenger and its WhatsApp application. That's not including the potential integration of the infancy stage messaging capability of FB's Instagram.Did I mention we're still talking just about FB? If you don't think this is the first ""shot fired"" in what will be a perpetual and endless list of followers (you don't think that Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is now going to be forced to find some way to integrate an offering that's similar?) in which ZEN will be the only proven and scale tested option for facilitation. You better believe that matters.I believe this news to change the long-term outlook for the company from one of high visibility of success to one of almost guaranteed success. FB cannot allow this venture to be non-success in that this venture - bringing businesses to consumers via its centralized platform - could end up being its biggest revenue segment. Yes, maybe bigger than advertising when it's all said and done. Regardless of that, I can't remember the last time a FB ""project"" failed.The investment community thought it was crazy for buying Instagram, some thought it marked the top of the social media bubble at the time. The investment community thought it was crazy for buying WhatsApp for a multiple of the price it paid for Instagram. The investment community recommended rehab for FB when it bought VR company Oculus. Is it really that big of a stretch of the imagination to think FB would buy a company with a $1.72 billion market cap that it ""self-made"" on the back of an excellent service that's already proven to have global scalability? Really?Expect ZEN's revenues to see a material uptick from the already fast rates of growth that we ZEN investors were expecting. When you factor in this FB news with the international expansion news the company released just a few weeks ago I think ZEN has an absolute blowout 12-18 months in front of it. Today's PR also goes a long way into explaining ZEN's recent cash raise, which was perfectly explainable prior as well, which it did most likely with the FB news in hand. I'll look to get in touch with ZEN IR over the next few days to see if ZEN can release anything around the economics of this partnership but even if they can't this is hugely bullish on all durations. I'm expecting the above mentioned revenues explosion, obviously a customer count explosion, sequentially falling S&M expenses as a percentage of revenues for the next hopefully 3 or 4 quarters as ZEN should need to do less S&M as it can live on the FB network effect (forgive the pun), and I'm expecting ZEN to realize a marked level of operating leverage as a result of all of this.Make no mistake, this announcement changes the ZEN game. Change with it.Good luck everybody."
2976436,48411,2015-03-05T11:18:46-05:00,ZEN's two most recent PR's detailing a data center launch in Germany and an Asian HQ are meaningful.ZEN has advances its global presence and fragmented its risk in more ways than one.Continue to be long ZEN.,"Don't overlook Zendesk, Inc.'s (NYSE:ZEN) two most recent PRs detailing a ~Q2/15 data center launch in Germany and an Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore. Both of these have much larger long-term implications than may first meet the eye.ZEN has been slowly growing into a highly diversified global powerhouse with ~45% of its Q4 revenues being comprised of international revenues. As ZEN continues to slowly fragment its risk away from the US and continues to slowly build out its global infrastructure I believe this will serve to position ZEN as a much more viable option for a multi-national competitor to acquire. I think that ZEN's ability to replicate data and provide disaster recovery to a greater degree with a German data center now running in conjunction with its 2013 Dublin Ireland opened center matters greatly and significantly moves ZEN's ""outside looking in"" value-prop forward. ZEN's platform has always been attractive to suitors, in my opinion, but now it's logistical and infrastructural additions are becoming a prize bargaining chip as well.ZEN has made Europe in particular a focus for 2015. Further, with its second operational location in Germany I feel it could rapidly expand its presence overall in the country and use this central hub as its European Headquarters in the near-term. Previously, ZEN deployed capital in the country via a sales office and an expanded sales team to increase sales, both have been highly effective uses of capital. Notable German customers of Zendesk include Deutsche Post, eDarling and Rewe Online. In regards to using Germany as a Euro HQ it should be noted that ZEN's EMEA region is the largest of its sales regions. (ZEN now has European offices in Berlin,Dublin, London and Copenhagen) so the idea would make sense in execution as it does in theory.As for ZEN's Asian announcements, this to me is the beginning of a period of major investments into the Asian region in general. Now, with an official commercial HQ established look for ramped spending to the region and revenue weighting growth. ZEN's previous acquisition of Zopim was a convenient entry channel into the region and should serve to provide it instant credibility and access to the area. I would like to see ZEN ramp spending to this region as well as I feel in general Asia is in the early innings of a customer service revolution that ZEN should be able to lead with its platforms competitive advantages.I remain long ZEN."
2940326,52012,2015-02-24T09:07:46-05:00,"Zendesk is engaged in a growth at any price strategy.Much of its costs are due to share based compensation, which greatly reduces per share growth metrics.The company's lack of financial discipline and the absence of any obvious economies of scale continue to have me short the stock.","I have previously written about my short position in Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) with my major arguments being the company's continued losses and exorbitant share based compensation leading to substantial shareholder dilution. Since then Dallas Salazar has written two excellent articles advocating the other side of the trade. Today I'd like to take up some of his arguments, but for anyone interested in the company, I highly recommend you read his articles as they present what I think is the best bull case for the stock.ZEN's GrowthTo begin with, I'd like to acknowledge that ZEN is a fast growing stock. As Dallas mentions, its CAGR on revenue from 2011 to 2013 is an impressive 112%. But my question is, what is this worth? Should ZEN be valued at $10M, $100M, $1B, $10B or even higher?Consider first that the aforementioned growth rate is on base revenues of a measly $16M. Total revenues for 2013 were only $127M, lowering the CAGR from 2011 to about 100%. And the company has guided revenues for 2015 to be on the order of $190M. As of Jan 31, the company had 75,791,926 shares outstanding which means that at today's market price of $24.26, the company is being valued at $1.84B. If that share count were to remain constant, then we'd be looking at a forward price to sales ratio of 9.7. In my opinion that's enormous for a chronically money-losing company which expects to lose money indefinitely. But it's much worse because that share count won't remain constant.Why Share Based Compensation MattersOne of the principal points that Dallas makes is that since the market doesn't care about share based compensation, why should any prospective buyer? And I agree that in today's easy-money environment analysts have turned a blind eye to the effect - yet I maintain that its consequences are real nonetheless. Since I've previously explained that in my opinion:I won't rehearse the arguments here again. Instead I'd like to look at how our perception of a company's success changes when we take SBC into account. Consider some of ZEN's annual financials collected in the table below.The table reflects my agreement with an argument that several astute commenters to my articles have made, namely that a company should get credit for deferred revenues gained -- not just sales recognized -- in a given period. Which is why I've added a row which sums the recognized revenue with the difference in deferred revenues as the more representative revenue figure. Using this total revenue metric, we see that ZEN increased sales by 87% in 2013 and 74% in 2014. But when we look at the same sales as a function of the shares outstanding, we see that the growth decreases to 70% and 39% respectively. Those are substantially reduced numbers, but they're the ones that you as a shareholder should care about since when you buy your shares, their number is fixed in future periods (i.e. you don't get an increased number of shares every year the way employees do).Moreover, the trend isn't improving as the company grows. Here are the quarterly numbers that I was able to cull from the SEC filings (ZEN is a recent IPO so there are only a few quarters available plus the S1 which makes getting all the relevant quarterly data more difficult).In the last quarter the sales/share quarterly increase was only 1%, i.e. only a fifth of the top line growth number. This is why SBC matters and ultimately will be reflected in the share price.ZEN's Share Count will Continue to GrowIf we could say that, as a recent IPO, ZEN had a one time pop in share count, but going forward the company will be much more disciplined, then the short side argument would be different. But every indication is that SBC is seen as free money by the company and its analysts, hence there's no need to curtail it. For example here are the insider option exercises and stock sales since the 10K filing date (only a few weeks ago):The past few weeks simply continue a trend that's been ongoing since the company has gone public (see my previous articles for details). Moreover, here is the stock and options activity for 2014:Despite substantial option exercises, the number of outstanding options and RSUs increased almost 50% year over year.Financial Discipline and Economies of ScalePart of the bull argument is that ZEN, just as many other cloud and internet companies, is engaged in a ""land and expand"" project that will show substantial economies of scale and this will quickly become obvious on the company's bottom line. Now in general I'm not a child of the times because I think that:But that said, let's look at the specifics of ZEN's economies of scale.During its recent earnings call ZEN pointed out that:The idea here is that once you obtain a customer, growing revenues incrementally should be easy (i.e. cheap and therefore profitable).Yet despite 60% of revenue growth coming from this ""easy"" source, if we look at the first table above, we don't see any such effect. Not only is the loss for every dollar of revenue increasing (or certainly not reducing), but also the revenues per employee aren't increasing while the loss per employee is still on the order of $80K. In other words so far there are no economies of scale to be had, rather employees (thanks largely to SBC) are simply consuming shareholder's capital in an effort to expand top line revenues at any price.In today's market none of this has yet been reflected in the company's share price, but I believe it will be (probably sooner rather than later), and when it is, I don't see the company being valued anywhere close to $1B, much less almost $2B. I remain short the stock as a result."
2851526,48411,2015-01-27T18:25:32-05:00,ZEN has had the two largest questions since its IPO answered: will the market care about share-based comp losses and can it continue to grow quickly?ZEN has shown yet another sequential quarter of fast paced revenue growth and is showing operational cash flow breakeven.BUY ZEN - it always was an attractive financial story that now can be trusted. Q4 earnings announcements should move shares higher.,"It's time to buy Zendesk, Inc. (NYSE:ZEN). Yes, as reluctant as I am to take ownership of the SaaS customer service platform company because of its massive share based comp usage and outstanding yet to be expensed share based comp I'm going to have to make an official BUY recommendation to readers. What's changed since I asked readers to avoid but don't short ZEN shares in mid-August? Nothing. Nothing but confirmation of two very important things: ZEN has confirmed with its second quarter as a public company (its Q3 results) that it continues to gain market share and the market has confirmed that it doesn't care about share-based comp driven losses. Those were the two big ""what if's"" that kept me from getting long shares at roughly the same price the shares trade at currently - shares are up 13% since I waited:With the confirmations detailed above in-hand there's nothing left to do but buy. I've been hot on SMB/enterprise solutions providers during the early going of 2015 and ZEN happens to be a provider of one of the most important, hard to execute services in the SMB/enterprise space. ZEN's customer service platform that allows customers to be proactive rather than reactive and that allows customers to track customer service outcomes to business outcomes is second to none in user friendliness and platform integration ability, and it's gaining more capabilities with the quarter.Since announcing Q3 results ZEN has reported launching the ability for clients, free of charge, to embed features that allow them build customer support and engagement into mobile and Web apps, websites, games, and other online experiences. ZEN continues to address the most prominent, front of mind needs that its clients require solutions for without clients needing to ask. I was never a ZEN platform doubter, just a doubter of the share float expansion and the net loss growth - both of which still remain solidly on the table. That said, it's time to roll the dice on this company as I think huge share price appreciation is on the near term horizon and as said above the market does care about either of the potential caps on the ride higher.Balance Sheet Strength, Growing Revenues, Operational Cash FlowZEN as a financial story was always attractive. That hasn't changed.This is largely the reason why it's the fourth most successful IPO in the last twelve months (to date, according to IPOscoop.com) with a total performance from IPO pricing of $9 of 188%. It should also be noted that of the top ten performers ZEN is the only non-biotech and the only company with substantial visibility into long-term viability. I think that matters in the ZEN story.For those unfamiliar with my previous article ZEN's model is subscription-based, operates at large losses on the quarter (share based comp is a meaningful portion of this) each quarter, is in full on 'land and expand' mode (revenue grew 76% on the 9M Y/Y), is currently focused on the SMB space but the company is slowly putting more and more a focus on the enterprise space, and is absurdly well managed in terms of operational cash flow. That basically sums up the bull case so you're either going to buy the fact that ZEN's a CAPEX/spending driven growth story or you're not. If not, I would exit this article now because that's what ZEN is. If you don't mind buying near-term losses for longer-term market disruption, read on.That's what the ZEN longer term plan boils down to. Conserve as much cash as possible by ""capitalizing"" R&D and SG&A costs using share based comp and grow, grow, grow. I LOVE these type of stories especially when they're SaaS based, especially when they are well funded - ZEN is - and especially when there's a huge market to disrupt - again, there is. ZEN to me was one of the hardest play-hard-to-get names I've had to wait on in recent memory but it was worth doing to avoid learning the hard way that the market cared about these. (It doesn't help that I've had to see the ZEN ads on the side of my screen every day 100 times a day but that's beside the point).When looking at ZEN compared to some other SMB/enterprise space solution providers on a price/sales ratio basis the company is right there with peers:So, we're looking at a company with an attractive model, not overvalued when compared to peers, in a hot ""sector"" with momentum, and about to report what I think will be a blowout Q4. What else do we need to know? Oh yeah the actual financials.Balance Sheet Strength:This is an easy one considering the company just IPO'd in August but it is what it is, ZEN's balance sheet is solid:The company has an empty $20 million revolver with just $7.7 million in equipment credit facility debt with very manageable payments over the next few years. The company has ~$110 million in C&CE, minimal Goodwill, and a clean capitalization. Any questions?ZEN's C&CE balance gives the company ample flexibility and should allow the company to continue to acquire growth, as it did with Zopim, Inc (a live chat software provider) during Q1/14, or to run at an even faster rate into 2015. Speaking of running faster, ZEN's CEO stated that he was disappointed at the pace of hiring during Q3/14 and expected to correct that during the next few quarters. Look for ZEN to drive operations even faster with expansion of its sales force during Q4 and into the balance of 2015. I'm excited about this because I'm expecting that to equate to top-line growth, something that ZEN has been able to correlate with hiring in the past.Of course, more revenues has also correlated with greater net loss in the past.Operations:Operations are the big polarizing force at ZEN for bulls and bears. Bulls point to the incredible top-line growth (up 76% on the quarter and 79% on the 9M) which has also been consistent both annually and sequentially:Super impressive top-line growth.However, notice the operating loss and the net loss have also grown at impressive rates. Take a look at ZEN's performance of metric lines on a percentage basis. Warning, this gets ugly:When net loss equates to 56% of revenues, that typically isn't good. Good thing the net loss here isn't being created by typical operations - notice the footnotes in this graphic and the share based comp cutout in the statement of operations graphic. Again, share based comp is a big deal at ZEN and has largely contributed to operating and net loss. It's going to continue to do so.That's why it's best to use non-GAAP figures to judge ZEN health of operations, the non-GAAP figures back out share based comp. For those tracking the company independently, ZEN annoyingly doesn't provide these in its 10-Q filings but online at its investor relations website within the quarter PR releases:When looking at the non-GAAP figures we get a different picture than that of the figures prior to backing out share based comp. Now instead of seeing gross margin contraction on the quarter and the 9M we see non-GAAP gross margin improvement for both periods.Now instead of seeing massive operating margin reductions of greater than 20% on both durations we see operating margin stability.The point I'm trying to make here is that ZEN is a very healthy grower when you don't have to care about share-based comp. Now that Mr. Market has essentially signed off on this I absolutely have to get long these operations. I mean, did you see that top-line growth?Cash flows look just as good.Cash Flow:So this is a pretty cut and dried graphic. Longs need to pay attention to one line only and that's operational cash flow. That figure backs out all the non-cash and one-time expenses (read: share base comp) and shows that on an actual dollar outflow basis the model is highly self-sustaining. Even at negative non-GAAP margins we see that in the face of a constant scale up the company has been able to maintain its cash needs. This becomes hugely important into trying to model out how much of the C&CE balance detailed in the balance sheet section will need to be used for operations and how much can go to acquisitions and other growth accelerants. Based on this cash flow statement and ZEN's recent operational cash flow trend line I would say substantially all of it can go to the latter. If you're going to have a bear thesis is sure as heck shouldn't start or end in this section.Where's the trade?I recommend a quarter by quarter long position in ZEN shares. I believe ZEN should be able to move higher shortly after Q4 reporting which hopefully will show further confirmation of trends and hiring.I look forward to providing continuing coverage in the future. Good luck to all."
2913986,48411,2015-02-12T20:40:46-05:00,I loved ZEN's full year 2014 and look for more of the same in 2015.ZEN has announced it plans to expand faster internationally and that it's moving upstream into the enterprise space - I'm bullish on both moves.Continue to BUY ZEN.,"Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) had an excellent close to its full year, although you wouldn't know that by looking at the stock Thursday. Most of what happened Thursday is about slightly light guidance on the full year (revenue is guided to grow 45-50%, in the range of $184-190 million). I'm guessing some folks fear how ZEN will do as it heads upstream into the enterprise space, something the company announced on its Q4 earnings conference call.I, however, think the full year was a blowout and provides further confirmation that ZEN is the only company currently offering a true customer service solution. Richard Davis from Cannacord made note that his firm's ""checks"" support CEO Mikkel Svane's assertion that before ZEN came around there wasn't a product like ZEN's in existence. That's always a nice foundation to build a bull thesis on.There were three big developments that came from the quarter outside of the massive revenue growth the company showed (revenue was $127.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of 76% over the year ended December 31, 2013). The first was that ZEN continues to introduce new products that make its platform stickier, more functional, and a more open architecture. Most notably, in 2014 ZEN debuted its ""Embeddables"" which are in-app, or in-game customer service options that don't force the user to exit the app, game, etc., to get customer service.ZEN has transformed customer service from a destination - some place a user had to go to get help (sending an email, visiting the company website, calling a number, etc.) to an actual service, and it has the analytics to prove that doing this matters. ZEN releases a quarterly analytics research report that removes names of its customers but details its customer bases successes and failures from a numbers standpoint - it's aptly called Zendesk Benchmark. The bottom line is that ZEN's continued innovation is continuing to drive the key metric growth at the company and continuing to allow it to move upstream. CEO Mikkel Svane gave some color around Embeddables on the earnings call:Next, ZEN has decided to expand. First, ZEN has expanded into Europe in a much bigger way with a few new salesforces across several countries and a focused increase in spending to help drive sales in the region. ZEN wants to take advantage of being a first mover in the space in the area, and I couldn't be happier about it.ZEN is also going to begin to take payment in country-specific currency which should boil down to the euro and the British pound but we'll have to see what else this ends up being. I think this will remove friction from the top of the sales funnel and should also create an incremental increase to already existing growth rates internationally. Not a make or break point but it matters in the bigger scheme of things. ZEN also announced having a Latin American focus in 2015 and noted winning its first big Latin-based customer of size. Getting off to a hot start is encouraging.Finally, ZEN has decided to move upstream. ZEN is at a point now where it can hire out salesforces and begin to target the enterprise space. Again, I think ZEN's product in its entirety is novel so I don't anticipate it having a hard time in the ""majors"" coming up from the ""minors"" of the SMB space but my guess is the market doesn't agree. Seeing the share price down on just a minimal downtick to revenue guidance expectation I'm going to speculate has something to do with the enterprise announcement. Regardless, I view this as a necessary move that had to happen eventually. I'd rather ZEN do it now than do it later when maybe another competitor of real threat comes along. I applaud this move.Now ZEN also noted that it finished the year with C&CE of ~$80 million and that it had marketable securities of ~$51 million. I anticipate ZEN to continue to be opportunistic with acquisitions as it was in 2014 with its Zopin acquisition. This live chat acquisition was a key product integration into the platform in 2014 that helped drive customer account retention. Why didn't I list it with Embeddables in the bullet point above? Live chat isn't really unique to ZEN and it's not an account closer, it's simply something that ZEN purchased because it was a better way to do something it was already doing. Still, it showed that ZEN can acquire and implement successfully and that ZEN can spend smartly. The Zopin acquisition was smart, it was pointed, and it made the platform more defensive. I'm looking for one more acquisition in 2015 of medium size before ZEN has to pull M&A in until its cash reserves build back up.I'm also going to continue to closely watch key metric growth for steady, sequential levels of growth. I don't anticipate this being a problem but clearly it's something that I have to pay attention to.All told I really like ZEN's finish to the full year and look forward to more big things from the company going forward. I recommend readers take advantage of this dip in pricing and BUY ZEN. I continue to recommend this position from the long side."
2783885,52012,2014-12-29T04:24:32-05:00,"Insider selling accelerates.
        Much of it comes from option exercises which raises the specter of increased dilution.
        My original short thesis remains intact and is amplified by this potential dilution.","A month ago I proposed Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) as a promising short sale candidate, citing two major reasons for the pick: potential insider selling after its IPO lockup expiry and the company's historical (and future) unprofitability. Since that time insider selling has accelerated, and the number of option exercises add a new dilution worry to the overall story. I discuss these concerns below.Insider Selling AcceleratesHere is a snapshot of the insider selling since my previous article (source). When perusing the data, remember that reported insider selling is only a subset of all employee and consultant stock sales, as many members of this larger group are not required to report. Thus overall employee selling is expected to be larger than what's shown here.The fact of large sales reported on December 24th reminds me a bit of companies who put out negative news in midnight 8-K filings on Friday nights!Of course another interpretation is simply that there's so much stock to sell that there's no time to lose.Potential DilutionIn my original article I didn't highlight the potential dilution overhanging the stock, but after seeing how much of the reported insider selling is due to option exercises, I'd like to look at that now.In its latest 10-Q, ZEN says there were 72,834,725 shares outstanding as of October 31, 2014. The reported options exercises since that time equal 574,093 shares (data from site linked to above). That's a 0.8% increase and about 5% on an annualized basis. But of course this is from reporting employees only. To get an idea of how much total dilution we can expect, we need to look at the number of options and restricted stock outstanding, as well as the rate of issuance of these shares.So there are 14M options with an average exercise price of $6.24 and another 3M RSU's outstanding, making the total potential dilution 17M shares or about 23% of the shares outstanding as of the end of October. If we use reporting insiders as a proxy for the impetus of all holders to exercise their dilutive options, we can expect to see a substantial increase in the number of shares outstanding over the next few quarters.Let me add an observation here regarding stock based compensation (SBC) and dilution. In one important respect they count the same thing, so it would be double counting to adduce each as a separate negative factor when appraising a stock's future prospects. But since in my original article I didn't discuss SBC in any detail, looking at dilution here is not double counting anything that's previously been discussed.More importantly, SBC on the income statement gives a snapshot for a given timeframe, while looking at the number of outstanding options and RSU's is a way to integrate SBC and financing issuances over time, including periods before the stock was public. Moreover, the rate of such grants, in this case 8.6M shares over 9 months, is indicative of management's willingness to dilute existing shareholders.Finally, looking at potential dilution gives us a sense of how much worse valuation metrics would be if all the dilutive securities were issued. In this case we should multiply valuation metrics presented at sites like yahoo! (see example below) by 1.23 to get the fully diluted values of such benchmarks as price to sales, price to earnings and price to book.ConclusionData that's become available since my original short thesis has only confirmed my negative appraisal - and as a result I remain short the stock."
2755985,52712,2014-12-15T10:48:23-05:00,"Zendesk trades at a premium valuation at roughly fifteen times trailing revenue and no earnings.Company is in hyper growth mode, growing revenue 76% year-over-year in the most recent quarter.Zendesk operates in a highly competitive sector, with numerous entrenched players.Insiders have been selling shares at these high price levels.Overall, Zendesk looks like a prime short candidate for someone with a stomach for volatility.","Situation: Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) went public in May at $9 per share. Since then the shares have skyrocketed, closing at $23.83 on December 12th. This increase was due in part to strong quarterly results and investor appetite for a strong top line growth businesses, even when it lacks profitability. The question is with much of the growth already priced into the stock and strong competition in the sector, is Zendesk a short candidate?Brief Business Description: The company is a software development company offering a SaaS customer service platform. The business model is to drive organic growth, leverage positive word of mouth, and remove friction from the evaluation and purchasing process. The company has 42,000 customer accounts on its customer service platform.Source: Zendesk Management PresentationWhy We Are Bearish On Zendesk:Valuation Is Very Expensive: We feel at the current valuation there is limited upside and large downside potential. We looked at bull, base and bear case scenarios utilizing analyst low, average, and high revenue estimates per Yahoo Finance. For comparable companies, we selected Zendesk's SaaS competitors, all with over a billion dollar market capitalization. For the bear case, we utilized a revenue multiple in line with Zendesk's peer set for the base and bull case we used incremental premium multiples. We projected 2015 net debt assuming a lower cash balance then current levels, given expected continued capital expenditures driving the cash balance lower. Diluted shares were computed using basic shares outstanding from the company's latest 10-Q, assuming option and restricted stock dilution using the treasury stock method, and assumed further share compensation issuances in line with 2014 occurring in 2015.Source: Author AnalysisSource: Author AnalysisExtremely Competitive Sector With Low Barriers To Entry: The market for customer relationship management (CRM) is enormous, with IDC estimating the 2012 customer relationship software market at $20.7 billion, with customer service software accounting for $10.2 billion of this value. However, the sector also is extremely competitive with numerous entrenched players. The market for customer service software also has relatively low barriers to entry, with numerous private startups in the space, such as Supportbee.com, and more likely to receive large VC funding. Additionally, nothing is proprietary within the sector. Zendesk for instance has only one issued patent related to searching queries. Within the customer service software space, the company competes with larger competitors who possess longer operating histories, more established customer relationships and larger marketing budgets. These larger companies such as Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) can bundle competing products with their existing offerings or offer them at a lower price, as a result of their scale. We examined Salesforce's version of Zendesk, termed Desk, and found it was able to handle necessary components of customer support with social media integration.Source: Desk Free Trial MembershipOver The Next 12 Months Company Is Likely To Invest Heavily In Product Development, Marketing And Acquisitions: The company in its prospectus detailed it is likely to continue investing in its customer service platform, including acquiring new products. The company recently acquired Zopim, which allowed Zendesk to offer live chat software. Zendesk is likely to continue pursuing acquisitions going forward in order to broaden its product offering and revenue per license seat. Additionally, the company in its prospectus filing detailed it is likely to continue expenditures on data centers and hosting as the company builds its infrastructure to support its large customer base.Heavy Insider Selling: Following the lockup expiration numerous insiders have been selling shares. Once example is Adrian Price, the company's SVP of Global Marketing, who recently sold out of his ownership stake in the company. In another filing the company's secretary sold his position in Zendesk. Although insiders can have numerous reasons for selling, we see the numerous form 4 sales filings as another data point in the short thesis.Key Risks For Shorts:Conclusion: Overall Zendesk looks like a solid short candidate. However, like many high momentum plays it is subject to substantial upticks before it reaches its intrinsic value. Still, holistically viewing the business we feel competitive pressures, a premium valuation, and heavy insider selling make Zendesk a good addition to a diversified short portfolio."

The expiration of the lockup period will allow ZEN's pre-IPO shareholders as well as its executives and directors to sell their shares in the provider software-as-a-service (SAAS) industry.The sudden increase in shares available for public trading that will likely occur with the conclusion of the lockup period may lead to a significant decrease in the price of ZEN shares, opening a short window for aggressive investors.ZEN's Business Summary: Successful, Innovative SaaS PlatformZEN designed their customer service platform to capitalize on industry shifts-facilitating long-term customer satisfaction and loyalty. ZEN's platform allows a company to better address their customer's questions and solve problems through channels, including chat, voice, social media, email and websites. Moreover, ZEN designed its platform to help customers discover answers through their own searches of knowledge bases and online communities, thereby capitalizing on the increasing preference for self-service.ZEN believes the openness and transparency of its SaaS platform gives organizations the ability to integrate their own applications with the ZEN platform in addition to consolidating data and providing powerful analytics for performance benchmarking.The majority of ZEN's customers finds the service online and subscribe directly from the ZEN website. Moreover, ZEN attributes its success to its sales and marketing strategy, which for the three months ending March 31, 2014, showed that 70 percent of qualified sales leads came from customer referrals, organic searches and other unpaid sources. Its sales team targets larger companies through its ""land and expand strategy,"" which exploits the grassroots adoption and expands the ZEN footprint within a subscribing company.Currently, ZEN has over 38,000 customer accounts subscribing to its SaaS platform, and this client base spans a wide spectrum of industries, sizes and geographies. They have clients in more than 140 companies and offer service in over 40 languages.In March 2014, ZEN acquired Zopim Technologies Pte Ltd., a software development organization that offers live SaaS chat service, which gives ZEN that capability to offer live chat software as an integrated service with ZEN's chat-enabled agents or as a standalone product.See our prior article on ZEN here.Competition from Oracle, Microsoft and Verint SystemsZEN competes against companies that provide general use software applications and other tools adapted for customer service for small to medium sized organizations. This includes such tools as phone banks for voice communication, shared accounts for email, and spreadsheets and text editors for management and tracking.For larger companies, ZEN competes with custom designed software systems including Microsoft, Oracle and Verint Systems. In addition, for companies seeking software that provides employee services and similar internal uses, ZEN competes against companies such as BMC Software, ServiceNow, Inc., and Hewlett Packard.In addition, they compete with numerous smaller SaaS providers that target customer service applications such as Desk.com, Freshdesk Inc., Kayako Helpdesk Pvt. Ltd., SupportBee, Inc., Brightwurks, Inc. and Tenmiles Technologies. Increasing competition and pressure on prices could lead to reduced margins, reduced sales, losses or the failure of ZEN's platform to secure or maintain a broad market penetration.Impending Unlocking Of Over 70 Million SharesZEN insiders (i.e. venture capital firms Charles River Ventures, Matrix Partners, and Benchmark Capital Partners; along with ZEN's principal executives and directors) hold 144A-restricted stock; in ZEN's case, these shares number over 70 million, contrasting with the 11.1 million from ZEN's IPO.ZEN's venture capital firms could likely seek to sell at least some of their shares in the interest of funding other projects. The firm's directors and executives might also likely take advantage of their first opportunity since the May IPO to sell their shares. This could be due to their need for cash and/or diversification.The sudden rise in shares available for public trading usually leads to decline in share prices. A joint study by Duke's Fuqua School of Business and Harvard Business School finds that this price drop is 2%. A second study from the NYU Department of Finance finds similar declines of 1%-3%.Losses are often concentrated in firms backed by venture capital (VC), as noted in the Journal of Finance (2001).Our own analysis of a sample of 242 companies with lockup expirations in 2013 and 2014, through June, suggests that the greatest negative returns (-5.5%) occur within the Day (-11, +9) period surrounding the lockup event (Day 0). These negative returns occur in tech firms that have yet to complete secondary offerings and whose share price has risen from IPO to Day (-11) from the lockup expiration.Early Market Performance: Improvement since MaySABR's IPO priced at $9 per share and opened for its first day of trading at $11.40 after pricing the stock in the mid-range of the expected $8 to $10 price range. The stock rose to a high of $27.74 on September 2. It currently trades around $20 to $21 per share.(Nasdaq.com)ConclusionAs described above, lockup expiration events often creates a short window of opportunity for aggressive investors.In the case of ZEN, given its strong venture capital backing and several individuals also holding restricted stock-the new supply of shares for sale could significantly lower ZEN's price, at least temporarily.With the stock declining slightly in recent months, yet remaining above its IPO and first day of trading price, we see a short opportunity on the horizon.We invite readers wishing to join the discussion on IPO lockup expirations to click the +FOLLOW button above the title of this article, and those looking for the latest updates to click +Get real-time alerts."
2720315,52012,2014-12-02T06:15:00-05:00,"Zendesk's valuation has benefited from a general cloud sector bubble.One catalyst to unwind this overvaluation is ZEN's IPO lockup expiration.A longer term -- and more concerning -- negative is ZEN's unprofitability, and its expectations that costs will remain stable or even increase as a percentage of revenues.These factors combine to make ZEN an attractive short sale candidate.","The CompanyI've previously disclosed a short position on two over-valued and unprofitable cloud sector stocks: Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and today I'd like to look at a third stock in what appears to me to be a sector ""bubble"" . Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) is a smaller cloud company aimed at smaller customers. It describes itself as follows:Though less well known a name, its valuation rivals that of its most over-blown cloud siblings. Here are the company's current yahoo! stats for reference:In previous articles linked to above, I've highlighted how stock-based compensation has eliminated any financial discipline these companies might have exercised. And while that argument is also true of ZEN, it's not quite as egregious as with NOW and WDAY. Instead, two other negative factors are operative here, both of which should result in lower stock prices over time.1. IPO Lockup Over, Insider Selling Has Begun in EarnestZEN IPO'ed earlier this year and now that the 180 day post IPO waiting period is over, many insider shares are likely to hit the market. Indeed ZEN describes the risk (in its latest 10Q) as follows:But this isn't just a potential boilerplate risk; it's a reality as selling has begun in earnest since the lockup expiration:(Source)For a stock whose 3 month daily average trading volume is only 401,511 shares, these sales (and the extra supply they represent) might weigh heavily on the stock price.2. No Path to ProfitabilityA second, and probably more important reason to be short the stock (or at least to avoid it long) is that the company is far from being profitable, and it doesn't see rising revenues leading to profitability. For many over-valued stocks, the bullish rationale (or hope) is that rapidly rising revenues will result in profitability down the road as economies of scale begin to have an effect. However that's decidedly not the case with ZEN.Here are ZEN's latest income and expense numbers in dollar terms (shown in thousands of dollars):And here they are as expressed as a percentage of revenue:As can be seen, the latest quarterly operating loss is 52.5% of revenues, which would require some incredible economies of scale to address. Yet in its latest 10Q, ZEN notes that while it expects R&D and G&A expenses to reduce modestly as a percentage of revenues, it also expects sales and marketing expenses to increase modestly as a percentage of revenues. Since sales and marketing already constitute a larger expense than R&D and G&A combined, this leaves no room to reduce expenses as a percentage of revenues, and hence leaves nothing but huge losses going forward!For those interested, I reproduce the language from the 10Q below, with my emphasis added:ConclusionZEN is an extremely overvalued company on any conventional metric such as P/E, PEG, P/S or P/B. It has a catalyst to unwind this overvaluation in the form of an IPO lockup expiry and the associated rush of insider selling. And the company is extremely unprofitable with no prospects of growth improving profitability.As a result I'm short the stock."
2409585,48411,2014-08-12T10:52:55-04:00,"Zendesk has an incredible set of operations that it has built largely by funding using share-based compensation.Zendesk is just now, outside of a one-time major recognition in Q4/12, beginning to have to recognize significant amounts of share-based compensation expenses.Zendesk has an already large and growing amount of share-based comp expenses and float growth that should only get larger down the road.","Trading IPOs is a very unique process that takes years to become adequate at, and even then, generally provides less logical outcomes than the broader markets. I've traded names that I thought were sure things, only to see share prices get halved, and I've shorted names that appeared like income statement losses were a certainty, only to have shares move higher and higher. One of the unique things about IPOs, and the broader markets do this as well but not usually to the extent of the IPO markets, is that if the market decides that a name should be given time to develop - the name is given time to develop, regardless of quarterly progress or lack of progress. The IPO market sometimes finds a darling that it just refuses to hold accountable. Sometimes it's the top-line growth that keeps the market coming back quarter after quarter, sometimes it's the end markets' potential, and sometimes, it's the disruptive potential for the company to develop a market all its own. In either case, this phenomenon oftentimes leaves the accumulators of the darling company's stock with a false sense of security, and ultimately with a surprised look on their faces when the market finally decides that the clock has struck midnight.Today's article will focus on Zendesk, Inc. (NYSE:ZEN), and will make the argument that the company is just entering the period of highest risk that the company will ever experience on a per share basis. This article will make the argument that based on an exponentiating share-based compensation expense, a questionable income statement pressured by the growing share-based comp expenses, and my belief that the company will use shares and further share-based compensation to quasi-capitalize R&D and SG&A costs, that Zendesk is an avoid or a soft short in the immediate term.Who is Zendesk, Inc.?ZEN held an IPO on 5.15.2014 and sold 12,800,000 shares at $9 share. The company raised $103.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.ZEN most recently closed at $21.29, for an IPO to-date performance of 137%. It is the 13th-most successful IPO out of the last 100 IPOs, according to IPOscoop.com. This is made further impressive when considering that of the IPOs with better performances than ZEN, only two held IPOs in 2014, and one of them has only been trading for less than 30 days and hasn't had a chance for the market to truly test it. What I'm saying is that ZEN is disadvantaged when compared to the other IPOs on the list, because it hasn't had as much time as a public company to grow its share price, but it has been trading long enough that the market has priced in risk to this point. Putting ZEN's IPO to-date performance into context is important, because my soft bear thesis is largely based on its performance since inception.What does ZEN do?What ZEN does is the reason its share price is on the moon, and the reason the market has allowed the company to accelerate losses each of the last two years and into the first half of this year. ZEN is an SAAS company that provides a customer service platform, but that is just the tip of the Titanic sinking the iceberg of what this company does - the competition being the Titanic, in this reference.ZEN's platform, which is easy to use, and in my humble opinion, is light years easier to use than any other competitor's platform (I've live-tested demos), is the better mousetrap. It serves all the basic customer service needs that competing products do, but it also provides live analytics to things like service ticket flow, tweet questions, email question/concern submission response time, etc. that the subscribing company can use to tie great customer service to business outcomes, which is what the company is really concerned about. Companies can now directly correlate customer satisfaction and the impact of customer service on upselling, churn reduction, and customer loyalty. ZEN's platform, and I mean this, is the first platform that moves customer service from being completely reactionary to a more live-response, proactive dynamic.ZEN's platform has grown even better with time, and most recently took the next step to the live-response evolution with its acquisition of Zopim, Inc., an industry leader in the live chat arena. ZEN has spent an incredible amount of energy in further developing its platform via its investments in R&D, SG&A, and acquisition, and plans to do more - so the asset that has allowed the stock to achieve just short of a billion-dollar valuation only stands to get better.Because of the abilities of the ZEN platform, the company's ability to constant evolve its technology, the unique analytics the platform provides, the new industry that ZEN is looking to develop - the proactive customer service arena, and finally, the growth that ZEN has been able to successfully capture (routinely posting quarterly and full-year top-line growth of ~80%), the market has priced in quite a bit of future growth. This has driven the share price higher and higher. What I think the market is missing, not considering, or just flat out hasn't cared about to this point (because to this point, it largely hasn't mattered to the financials or to the actual share price) is the fact that ZEN has been growing substantially an income statement-suppressing line item in aggregate that gets expensed across several other line items, and ultimately should work to suppress share price gains - share-based compensation.Does share-based compensation even matter?This is one of those questions that is an argument, a philosophical polarizing question, at every bank on the Street in charge of determining valuation. ""Does share-based comp matter?"", and the two sides of the broader argument is something I won't get into in this article, but I'll tell you that depending on the exact scenario being discussed and a laundry list of other factors, I myself have been and continued to be torn on this issue.Now, ZEN has been using share-based compensation to this point to two things: use shares as a currency to buy units of labor with, and quasi-capitalize R&D and SG&A. I'll break down both.ZEN, to this point, has used shares either by way of issuing convertible preferred stock, stock options, or restricted stock units to either raise cash or defer cash compensation. It has funded its entire operations, minus some cash contributions, via its shares. The funding of operations using stock and the scale with which ZEN has done it isn't unusual for the technology space, but similar IPOs to do this obviously haven't had their share prices appreciate to the levels that ZEN has so soon out of the gates; and of recent technology companies to utilize this strategy, ZEN is one of the largest users, from a share-based comp expense to total revenue percentage standpoint. This will be discussed in detail shortly. Part of that could be explained by the general macro markets being at all-time highs, and part of that could be explained by how ZEN scheduled the effects of its share-based comp usage to come due. Either way, this presents an unprecedented situation to trade around.Companies like to use share-based comp to help fund operations, because it doesn't affect actual cash flow at the company and because no two situations of usage or share-based comp plans (terms of the share-based comp that need to be satisfied for the shares to become vested) are the same the actual compensation packages become hard to value - oftentimes leaving some amount of risk not priced into the stock at the company, and raising no red flags. Also, when the shares are exercised, the company that issued the shares gets a cash inflow that it can use for general purposes, while not selling any tangible asset other than shareholder value. That's an important concept to understand.ZEN has had to recognize share-based comp on its income statement as an expense, which increases total expenses and presses down on net income. This FASB rule was meant to make obvious to investors the effects that share-based comp has/has had/will have long term on the operating results at the company - something that share-based comp wasn't showing to do prior to 2006. What companies have found out is that eventually, they will receive a cash benefit from a prior addition to an expense line, at minimal obvious detriment to the shareholder value. In the short term, the company is allowed to pay bills that normally would have required a cash outflow (salaries, purchasing companies, etc.) without creating a cash outflow. This additional cash on the balance sheet and what appears to be better cash management on the cash flow statement is something that, again, is either ignored from a risk standpoint or not cared about, and actually is viewed as a positive by quite a few houses on the Street - as evidenced by the ratings on ZEN:ANALYST RATINGS:Long term, what this type of management strategy does is dilute existing shareholders, dilute per-share ownership of earnings and other tangible assets, and transfer value from shareholders to those being given the shares in the compensation packages. It also places a ceiling on the share price through dilution, that without adequate momentum, can be hard to work through quarter after quarter. The combination of the depressed operating results and expanding share float works together to limit share price upside.The hope is that prior to the actual shares of the company doing the issuing appreciating to levels that the expenses become obvious on an income statement, the company will have built enough momentum to steam through the dilution and transferring of shareholder value. This is the way this management strategy theoretically should work, because the market is not expected to look at accelerating losses and continue to buy shares at higher and higher levels - something the market has done so far with ZEN. This has created the problem that I would like investors to take notice of.TremorsFor instance:The first time ZEN had to show a significant expensing of share-based comp was in Q4/12. The company has to recognize ~$8.6 million in comp expense that was realized during the quarter. This was the result of fairly complicated transaction, involving the purchasers of a portion of ZEN's convertible preferred stock (issued in early FY12 to raise cash) making a tender offer to acquire approximately 4.0 million shares of outstanding vested common stock from employees, former employees, and other existing investors. The large exercising of rights to share-based comp created a huge variance on a quarterly level (shown below) and an FY variance from trend line reduction in net loss.Of the ~$24.4 million FY12 net loss because of the tender offer made and executed, 35% of the total net loss was comprised of share-based comp expenses. Now, I think ZEN allowed this tender offer to complete for two reasons, (1) to raise additional cash, and (2) because it would allow the company to appear as if it was closing the net loss gap headed into its IPO. That's complete speculation on item 2, but it makes sense. Share-based comp expenses reverted to historic levels in 2013, and had no meaningful effect on the income statement. The skewing of results for 2013 was minimal, and the losses that ZEN posted were all organic, none coming from the dead weight of prior alternate, share-based currency usage. This left analysts to salivate over the incredible levels of customer growth and top-line growth the company had shown Y/Y.Now, in its S-1 filing, ZEN estimated the effects that its share-base comp practices would have on the public company's results:The problem is that the estimates were based on the market slowly increasing ZEN's share price, as the company was still showing significant and growing net losses. This has clearly not been the case. ZEN's management made the following statement during its roadshow and in its S-1:That statement was made using $9.52 as the fair value measurement for ZEN common stock; the shares recently closed at $21.29. This means that at the time of the IPO, with the share-based comp expenses already on the books and waiting for vesting events to satisfy (the closing of the IPO satisfied the Performance requirement of all outstanding share-based comp), that minus the ~$1.8 million of share-based comp recognized during Q1/14 and the share-based comp most recently recognized during Q2/14 (to be discussed in detail later), ZEN had what amounted to ~$45.5 million of share-based comp expenses (at current prices) to be expensed over the next 18 months. That would be equal to double FY13 losses. These are not small numbers we're talking about. Of the recently guided FY14 GAAP operating loss of $72-$74 million, management expects share-based comp to contribute $30 million to losses alone. That means minus the $1.8 million of share-based comp expense in Q1/13 and the ~$11 million recognized in Q2/14 that outside of the share lock-up expiration (which hasn't been factored into the above estimate of FY share-based comp expenses), management still sees another $17.2 million of additional expenses in Q3 and Q4/14. Knowing these expenses are coming, and each day the aggregate amount of the liability grows and that the share price may never be this high, do you think that incents insiders to not sell at the time of lock-up expiration? The share price going higher is a variable they will have to consider, but they know for a fact the share float will never be smaller (at least short- and mid-term) and that the company plans to use shares further down the road for acquisitions and other capitalizing of expenses. I think this is setting the table for huge amounts of selling into the lock-up expiration.During Q1/14, the period that the statement was addressing, instead of recognizing $3.6 million in total share-based comp expenses to the income statement, ZEN only addressed the $1.8 million of share-based comp expenses that were in-the-money, without needing the closing of the public offering to satisfy a performance requirement. Even so, share-based comp was 17% of the total quarterly net loss, and would have been ~35% of net loss had the triggering event already been in place. That's a significant portion of the net loss, and because it is tethered to a variable that has unlimited upside, the potential additions to net loss could be staggering down the road - I think they are already. This means that current longs, current ZEN buyers who are causing the increase in share price, are the persons responsible for the increasing of share-based comp expenses (what do they care, they're getting rich in the short term) and the increasing of opportunistic exit points for insiders at lock-up expo. This has worked out for everybody short term, but there has to be a loser in this scenario long term. Remember that when considering a long at quarter ends, and especially at lock-up expo.More recently, with the triggering event in place to satisfy the Performance requirement of vesting, ZEN had to recognize ~$11 million (mentioned above) in stock-based comp expenses. All told, for the first six months of 2014, of the total ~$32.2 million in net losses that the company posted, ~40% were from share-based compensation. This figure, as a percentage of revenues, is only as absurd as it has become because the variable that determines the actual expense line growth of share-based compensation has continued to grow at levels that currently do not reflect the income statement effects that the dilutive management practices are having and will have in the future to current shareholders. Yes, the company is growing the top-line at incredible rates. Yes, the company does have a great product. But at some point, the growth that the company is showing and will show will have less and less of an effect on a per share basis as the float expands. That's not good for existing shareholder value.ZEN should and has expressed that in the short term, it will continue to act opportunistically with its use of shares as a currency. For instance, its acquisition of Zopim, Inc., which will create a ton of shareholder value long term and I feel will help win contracts short term, was financed with $4.8 million of cash and $10.9 million of common stock. In effect, this acquisition served to capitalize the R&D expense that would have been needed for ZEN to develop these capabilities on its own and the SG&A expense ZEN would have needed to spend to acquire a similar book of business tethered to the business line. What's great about the acquisition using a 60/30 percentage mix of shares to cash is that the shares can't be exercised in the immediate term, and won't reflect negatively on the expense line until the merger is hopefully adding to the bottom line - helping cover up the usage of shares as a currency. This is the type of correct usage of share-based comp I would like to see more of at ZEN. Not the kind that treats existing shareholders and current shareholder value as an ATM that never requires payment back. The usage of shares as a currency, in this instance, help match expenses to revenues, and should actually smooth out any financial variance caused by the acquisition. The prior usages of shares as a currency clearly have had the opposite effect.Where's the trade?Looking at the cash flow statement, you can see there has been zero negative effect of the share-based comp expense to the actual cash at ZEN, and that the only evidence that what is going on is even happening is on the income statement, which is useless in making clear the negative effects of the dilution (apparently, look at the share price), and the balance sheet, which buries the increased in float size in even more obscure line items.One thing the cash flow statement does show is that this is a company with a great amount of actual cash, a reasonable burn on the operational level when considering total income statement losses, and meaningful CAPEX that should help to continue to allow the company to scale up. What I'm saying is this is a solid company across the board, outside of the expanding share float. Maybe that doesn't matter either. Maybe the market continues to buy the shares higher and higher, and maybe the stock gets so much momentum that it buys any shares being sold into the lock-up, and then some. Maybe the company gets to continue to use shares as a currency and transfer shareholder value from the shareholder to those receiving shares, and nobody blinks.I'm betting eventually this does matter, at least in the short term, and that if the shares are still trading at or around these levels at the lock-up, insiders will have no choice but to sell. I'm initiating coverage on ZEN with a short-term avoid or a soft short at these levels.If you're going to be long, I would recommend a sell prior to the lock-up expiration and prior to Q2/14 earnings. Theoretically, the large share-based comp expense that will hit the income statement should matter, and theoretically, the share price should get hit. It should be noted that this was not the case after Q1 earnings, with the stock moving sharply higher on the better guidance than expected.I look forward to providing continuing coverage in the future. Good luck to all.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in ZEN over the next 72 hours.

Another report by Market Research Media expects strong growth within cloud computing to continue. The report projects a 30% annual growth rate over the five year period from 2015 with the market expected to be worth $270 billion by 2020.Zendesk’s (NYSE:ZEN) FinancialsAn IDC research report estimates the global customer relationship management (CRM) software market at $20.7 billion in 2012 of which the customer service and contact center segments accounted for $10.2 billion. Analysts believe that over the period 2012 through 2017, growth in CRM will be driven by SaaS-based solutions which will report ten times the growth than legacy on-premise solutions. Cloud-based help desk support and ticketing application services provider Zendesk is counting on that growth.Zendesk offers a SaaS-based customer service platform that helps organizations connect with their end customers to drive improved customer engagement. Their platform offers customer support through multiple channels ranging from self-service options to email, chat, voice, social media, and websites. The platform also consolidates data from customer interactions to provide organizations with meaningful analytics for performance benchmarking.They have a customer base of more than 40,000 organizations across 140 countries. They cater to these customers in more than 40 languages. Their platform’s strong capabilities have helped them deliver strong revenue growth. Zendesk reported revenues of $72.0 million last year, recording an 88% growth over the year. Customers outside the US accounted for 41% of their revenues. But, like several other SaaS players, revenue growth has yet to turn into profits. Zendesk reported losses of $24.4 million in 2012 which narrowed marginally to $22.6 million in 2013.Till recently, Zendesk was venture funded with $85 million in funding from investors including Christoph Janz, Charles River Ventures, Benchmark, Matrix Partners, Redpoint Ventures, GGV Capital, Goldman Sachs, and Index Ventures. Last month, they went public and raised $100 million by selling 11.1 million shares at $9.00 each. They listed on the NYSE under the ticker ZEN. Zendesk plans to use these funds for acquisitions.Zendesk’s AcquisitionBefore they went public, Zendesk announced the acquisition of Zopim Technologies, a privately held software development firm that offers SaaS-based live chat service for an estimated $30 million. Singapore-based Zopim is a leading provider of live chat software that provides free and paid for live chat plans. Their widget is being used by more than 120,000 websites across 140 countries. Zopim had reported revenues of $1.4 million in 2012 with a net income of $289,000. Zendesk already has their live chat software, but they will phase it out to make way for Zopim’s solution and integrate the offering with their platform for chat-enabled agents.CompetitionThe cloud-based CRM market has seen a lot of competition and consolidation. There are comparatively smaller players like Freshdesk from India, which is part of our 1M/1M portfolio and Zoho competing with Zendesk. Freshdesk now has over 10,000 customers across 180 countries and Zoho does not disclose its financials. Then, there are the giants like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (NYSE:SAP), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also playing in the market that is estimated to grow to $36 billion by 2017. Salesforce is the leader in the market with nearly 15% market share and has access to funds with which it can help consolidate the sector. The industry has already started to see some consolidation. Back in 2011, Salesforce bought Assistly for $50 million followed by the $1.5 billion acquisition of RightNow by Oracle and in 2012, Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) acquired New Zealand-based Beetil. The coffers that these giants have with them will make it fairly easy for them to acquire the smaller players which are already eating into their share, especially of the SMB market. In fact, SAP is, most likely, going to make an acquisition in the sector in short order. Would that be Zendesk, or a smaller player like Freshdesk?Zendesk’s stock is trading at $15.22 with a market capitalization of $1.07 billion. It touched a high of $18.45 last week."

The early purchases generate the perception of rising demand, and cause share prices to rise before the expiration of the quiet period.ZEN Business Helps Ease Customer ExperienceZEN offers a Software-as-a-Service customer service platform designed to enhance customer engagement and to allow firms to provide service via popular media, such as chat, email, websites, voice, and social media.

As such a valuation north of a billion seems ridiculous in my eyes as it values the business at more than 13 times annual revenues.As such I remain cautious and will stay on the sidelines with a bearish stance.The Public OfferingZendesk develops software which helps organizations transform their customer service experience in order to create long-term customer loyalty and increase satisfaction. Through a simple platform it makes it easier to solve problems for consumers while customers can furthermore opt for self-service solutions.On Thursday, May 15th, Zendesk sold 11.1 million shares for $9 apiece, thereby raising $100 million in gross proceeds. As no shares were being offered by selling shareholders, all of these proceeds will benefit the company.As a matter of fact, the company disclosed that three venture-capital firms and other early backers of the company indicated having an interest to buy $25 million worth of shares in the public offering. In total some 14% of the outstanding shares were offered in the initial public offering.The pricing took place at the midpoint of the preliminary $8-$10 price range. At current levels around $15.25 the market values the equity in the business at $1.07 billion.The major banks that brought the company public were Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Pacific Crest Securities and Canaccord Genuity.ValuationBesides improving the customer service experience, Zendesk's platform allows for better self-service opportunities. At the same time the platform captures all the information and data which companies can use to analyze customer service as well as perform benchmarking across its customer service staff.The company relies heavily on word of mouth and free trials for its advertising. It currently serves 40,000 customers in some 40 languages in over 140 countries.Revenues for 2013 came in at $72.0 million which is up by 88.5% on the year before. The company reported a $22.6 million loss which is narrower than the $32.7 million loss as reported in 2012.Growth was solid with Zendesk ending the year with strong growth rates. Fourth quarter revenues were up by 82.9% to $22.5 million. Net losses more than halved for the quarter and came in at $6.1 million. This compares to a $13.6 million loss the year before.Before the offering took place Zendesk operated with nearly $64 million in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company used $24 million from its credit facility, resulting in a net cash position of $40 million. Including gross proceeds of $100 million resulting from the offering, Zendesk will hold roughly $130 million in net cash.With a current market capitalization of $1.07 billion, net operating assets are valued at roughly $950 million. This values operating assets at a little over 13 times annual revenues.Investment ThesisAs noted above, Zendesk has seen a very successful public offering after shares were offered at the midpoint of the preliminary offering range. Shares have risen 69.4% in their first two days of trading alone.Investors are attracted to the word ¨Software-as-a-Service,"" rapid revenue growth and narrowing losses. The business model allows for high margins and recurring revenues, which is very attractive to investors.Comforting is the very diversified customer base, with its 40,000 customers generating average revenues per annum of $1,750. The solid financial position and narrowing losses are positive points as well. There are some risks of course. This includes the reliance upon a single software platform, relatively weak barriers to entry, reliance on key staff and potential security breaches. In my eyes, the biggest risk might be the valuation after all.While Zendesk is offering a promising service and is showing solid growth, I fail to see how this loss-making and rather small-scale business can justify a valuation north of a billion.Competing firms are able to develop a competing model from scratch with relatively few resources as I don't see a distinct advantage of Zendesk's product offering, nor do I see sufficient current scale to justify this valuation.I remain on the sidelines with a bearish stance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."

4338982,35181,2020-04-21T20:49:45-04:00,"Last year's AppRiver acquisition has led to a stretched balance sheet, including a high debt level and little cash.The company's Current Ratio is 0.38, the lowest figure in my digital transformation database. Zix only has enough cash and equivalents to cover 38% of short-term debt.The company may have difficulty continuing operation in the current market environment without diluting shareholders or incurring high-interest loans.","Zix Corporation (NASDAQ:ZIXI), a leader in email security, may have bitten off more than it can chew with its acquisition of AppRiver, a little more than a year ago. I noted in a previous article that, prior to the acquisition, Zix was struggling with its revenue growth of 7% and declining retention rate. The AppRiver acquisition breathed new life into Zix, and the acquisition seemed to make sense at the time.The main issue with the acquisition was that AppRiver was larger than Zix and resulted in Zix stretching its finances. Fast forward to the present and the combined business has only $13 million in cash and equivalents and nearly $200 million in total debt.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In normal times, I believe that the balance sheet would be manageable although with significant risk. But times are not normal, and it is unclear how Zix will perform in the current economy.The company's Current Ratio is telling. Prior to the acquisition, Zix had a Current Ratio of approximately 1, which meant that its short-term assets could cover its short-term debt.But the company's Current Ratio has been trending down and now sits at a very low 0.38.(Source: Portfolio123)In fact, Zix has the lowest Current Ratio of all the digital transformation stocks that I track, all 152 of them.(Source: Portfolio123)Zix has only 38% of cash and equivalents on its books to cover the short-term debt. The company is very much dependent on strong future performance to cover its short-term obligations.Unfortunately, the AppRiver acquisition put pressure on the company's gross profit margins, primarily due to the Office 365 security application which has lower margins.(Source: Portfolio123)Zix's free cash flow margin has dropped to 1%, just above breakeven as shown in the graph below.(Source: Portfolio123)The bright side is that Zix is very much in bed with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), providing security products for Microsoft 365. Note that this is not an exclusive arrangement. Therefore, Zix has competition, and Microsoft also has its own free security offerings.Microsoft is giving away Office 365 and Teams access during the pandemic, and this should significantly boost usage of the Microsoft products. What we don't know is whether the giveaway will translate into higher revenue for Zix.In this environment, where small businesses are hurting, I expect such businesses to cutback expenses en masse and will likely affect Zix as company's potentially shift to Microsoft's free security features.There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher growth stocks are valued more than lower growth stocks and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward sales, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how Zix stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the valuation. In this instance, Zix is situated well below the best-fit line. This suggests that Zix is undervalued on a relative basis. The undervaluation is likely due to the problems I listed above including the high debt level and the small amount of cash on hand.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The metric sidesteps the valuation dilemma for high-growth companies that generally don't show profits. The Rule of 40 allows for both revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) in combination such that they must add up to at least 40%. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can turn a blind eye to negative free cash flow to some extent. On the other hand, if a company grows by less than 40%, then the company should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less than ideal growth.This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate growth companies. Young companies tend to have high revenue growth but are burning cash. Mature companies have lower revenue growth, but they make up in terms of free cash flow. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to one of my previous articles. Given the large acquisition last year, the combined revenue growth is difficult to assess. Therefore, I am going to use Zix's stated combined organic ARR growth of 15% for the Rule of 40 calculation.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In Zix's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 15% + 1% = 16%Zix scores below the 40% needed to fulfill the Rule of 40, meaning that Zix is having difficulty achieving a healthy balance between growth and profitability.Zix operates in the email security niche and competes primarily with two other companies, Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT) and Mimecast (NASDAQ:MIME). Zix acquired AppRiver last year, a move that allowed Zix to move into serving small and medium-sized businesses, something that Proofpoint and Mimecast do not target. Unfortunately, small business customers translate into lower margins and higher churn. Zix has put itself in a position where it has to perform well in order to cover its debts incurred in the AppRiver acquisition. It is unclear how well the company will actually perform during the pandemic and anticipated global recession. Zix may get a tailwind from MS Office 365 growth, or small business may choose to go with Microsoft free security products. In any case, Zix is in a high-risk situation, and I don't feel that investors should take the risk as there are better investments. Therefore, I am giving Zix a neutral rating."
4288709,35181,2019-08-29T13:46:14-04:00,"Zix is a cybersecurity company focused on Email.The company recently acquired AppRiver which is larger and has better metrics.As a result of the acquisition, Zix is left with a small amount of cash and a lot of debt.Stock price has been taking a beating recently.","Zix Corporation (ZIXI) shareholders must be feeling pretty underwhelmed lately as Zix stock has taken a beating this summer. After reaching an all-time high of ~$11 in early May, the stock has had a roller coaster ride within a descending channel. The lower channel trendline was recently breached and the stock price has dropped to $7.05 while rapidly descending towards the support level at $6.60.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)Zix is in the cybersecurity business, specifically Email security and competes with Proofpoint (PFPT) and Mimecast (MIME) among others. I have covered these two companies recently and the articles can be found here:Zix is in a state of flux after acquiring AppRiver, another email-centric cybersecurity company. It is truly difficult to assess the company fundamentals until the two companies are fully merged and settled.(Source: Zix)The reason for the recent stock price drop isn't entirely clear, but it is my belief that the AppRiver acquisition may have been an act of desperation as it appears that cracks were showing in Zix's underlying business prior to the acquisition (more on this later).(Source: Zix)In my estimation, Zix is very undervalued at the current stock price. Under normal circumstances, I would jump at the chance to play the contrarian and go long. But, in this case, I believe that caution is in order. I need a better understanding of why the stock price is taking such a beating before doing anything that might turn out to be foolish.For this reason, I am giving Zix a neutral rating, a rating that I may revise if the root cause of the recent price action becomes apparent and/or the stock price drops below the support level of $6.60.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 87 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Zix is well under the trend line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is significantly better than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Zix is extremely undervalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.Being highly undervalued is not always a good thing. There may very well be an explanation of why the stock is a bargain-basement price.High-growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40 is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus profit adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.Given that Zix is in a state of flux with the recent acquisitions, I am going to forego my usual Rule of 40 analysis and take company management for their word:Normally, when a company fulfills the Rule of 40, I don't analyze cash burn. But I am providing the SG&A expense here for reference. From looking at the SG&A expense relative to sales, I can tell that Zix's cash burn is slightly elevated but not severe.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)In the case of Zix, the SG&A expense is 52% of the total revenues.Another way to look at cash burn is to create a scatter plot that shows the operating margin/EV versus forward sales growth for digital transformation stocks. The operating margin for my purposes is calculated as follows:Operating Margin = Gross Margin TTM - SG&A Expense Margin TTM(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)This view shows the combined effect of the gross margin and SG&A expense margin. In the case of Zix, the operating margin is well above the trend line suggesting that cash burn is substantially lower than its peers.On the surface, there is nothing wrong with company fundamentals, and the stock is severely undervalued relative to its peers.Prior to the AppRiver acquisition, Zix was struggling with revenue growth. From 2015 to early 2019, YoY revenue growth TTM ranged between 5% and 10%. In January 2019, immediately prior to the AppRiver acquisition, revenue growth was approximately 7%.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)Based on pre-acquisition revenue growth and the following statement by management in the Q2 2019 earnings call, it is clear that Zix was struggling.I have not been able to establish how much business is done with or through Symantec (SYMC) or the unnamed partnership that Zix was referring to. However, I have to assume the level of business involved with Symantec is fairly substantial or it wouldn't have been mentioned in the earnings call.Readers should be warned that Symantec is presently conducting a global restructuring, selling off parts of the company, reducing headcount, and optimizing product offerings. Although I am speculating, it is very possible that Zix's partnership with Symantec may take a hit as a result of Symantec's restructuring.Another worrisome issue is identified in the annual report:I view 90% recurring revenue retention as substandard. There are lots of companies out there with 95% or higher customer retention.Zix also stated that dollar-based net retention was approximately 98%. In my opinion, this figure is also substandard. There are many investable SaaS companies with dollar-based net retention rates well above 100%. Zix is essentially bleeding customers, and this is why the pre-acquisition revenue growth of 7% is low for a SaaS company.It is clear that Zix management had to do something about the company's anemic performance, and this was the reason for the AppRiver acquisition. What I can't figure out for the life of me is how they managed to pull this off.(Source: Zix)AppRiver is a larger company than Zix and has substantially better SaaS metrics. AppRiver has higher ARR growth rate, higher customer retention, and higher dollar-based net retention.Zix managed to acquire AppRiver for $276 million while AppRiver's 2018 estimated revenue was $97 million. This means that AppRiver was acquired for approximately 3x annual revenue, a bargain-basement price for sure!But at what cost?The AppRiver acquisition has left Zix with a measly $11 million in cash, liabilities to the tune of $263 million and negative free cash flow.(Source: Portfolio123)Now, Zix is stuck servicing a high debt level, has little cash, and is operating in a volatile economic environment with ongoing trade disputes, European recession, Brexit, and a Federal Reserve that doesn't know what to do. SaaS stocks may very well be bubbling, and even the slightest market noise sends them tumbling.Competitors such as Proofpoint and Mimecast are providing security awareness training as a major feature of their platforms. There is no mention of this by Zix or AppRiver as a current or future product offering. I believe that this is an area of business that may be costing them.Zix is in the email security business and competes with Proofpoint, Mimecast among others. Zix recently acquired AppRiver, another email security company. I have bypassed my normal Rule of 40 calculation and instead relied on company management statement to the effect that they are spot on with the Rule of 40.Zix's operation appears to be really good compared to its peers. The same goes for stock price valuation. I am speculating that Zix management was struggling with performance and felt it necessary to make a major acquisition and did so by acquiring AppRiver, a bigger company with similar products but better SaaS metrics.After reaching an all-time high of ~$11 in early May, the stock has dropped to $7.05 just above the support level of $6.60. I would normally consider this to be a contrarian investment opportunity. But, in this case, a better understanding of why the stock price is taking such a beating is warranted. The merged company has dug a hole for itself with a major debt load and a small amount of cash. For this reason, I am giving Zix a neutral rating."
4371702,102101,2020-08-31T11:30:54-04:00,"Zix plays into favorable tech trends. It has strengthened its capabilities to win in the mid-market for e-mail security solutions.The huge cost of capital it incurred to drive growth is being discounted by the market. This is weighing heavily on multiples expansion.As the macro environment improves, Zix has the optionality to drive sustainable growth and free cash flow.The strong growth factor will improve Zix's valuation in the coming quarters.","Zix (NASDAQ:ZIXI) has improved its capabilities and competitive positioning to ride favorable tech tailwinds. The market continues to discount its huge cost of capital and its ability to generate substantial free cash flow. Zix's strengthened sales strategy shows it is more than capable of driving sustainable growth. Given its subdued valuation (P/S of 1.5x), Zix is a tough investment to pass on.Zix is an e-mail security business reviving its growth factor. Zix has capabilities in e-mail encryption, data loss prevention, compliance, and advanced threat protection. These capabilities position Zix into favorable tech trends such as the proliferation of e-mail-based attacks, data breaches, and the need to stay compliant with the latest security standards. The strategic acquisition of AppRiver has improved Zix's growth factor in recent quarters. With AppRiver, Zix enjoys improved sales motion from channel partners (4,450+ strong Managed Service Provider (MSP) reseller community). Zix has also improved its international presence. Prior to the acquisition of AppRiver, Zix derived most of its revenue from the US. Zix has also been able to play into favorable demand-side trends such as the growing adoption of cloud products (mostly Office 365) via the recent release of Secure Cloud. Going forward, Zix is guiding for double-digit revenue growth (21%-25%) in FY'20 after its double-digit growth beat in Q2'20. This will benefit from its 100% subscription business model, and its significantly improved go-to market motion. The last earnings report included an improved dollar retention rate update for July after the dip recorded in Q2. This is a function of improved adoption and expansion from existing customers and better pipeline conversion of new customers.Given these attractive characteristics, we believe Zix has a strong growth factor to acquire market share and drive multiples expansion in the near term.The acquisition of AppRiver changed the game for Zix by improving its product capabilities, and its go-to market motion. This drives value in the form of better product visibility as Zix leverages AppRiver's network of MSPs. The downside to this is the strain on its balance sheet as the acquisition was completed at a huge cost.Source: ZixZix's capital structure includes annual interest payments to debt investors and dividend payments to preferred equity investors. While common stockholders enjoy the multiples expansion that comes with Zix's strengthened growth factor, there is little left in free cash flow to support valuation multiples after obligations to other investors are fulfilled. As it stands, Zix is guiding for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24% in FY'20. This is in line with the EBITDA margin reported in Q2'20. This means little margin expansion heading into 2021. The EBITDA guidance is enough to satisfy its debt covenant of net debt to EBITDA margin above 4.75x for FY'20. Equity investors will have to look into other metrics like uFCF/free cash flow to project valuation growth. In the short term, the shift to monthly billings in addition to cash collection volatility (driven by COVID impact to SMBs) is expected to impact operating cash flow. This means Zix has to keep optimizing its customer acquisition cost while driving sales volume to shore up its working capital. Zix's quick and current ratios are less than one, and it has negative working capital. The advantage for Zix comes from the attractive margins of its business when we strip out noncash charges and short-term debt obligations. Zix also has deferred tax assets to shore up its EPS factor via the valuation allowance adjustment of its NOLs ($239m). While the margin guidance is reassuring, Zix has to execute to perfection to manage liquidity worries.Zix's geo-expansion strategy received a major boost after the acquisition of AppRiver. Zix's competitive position has also improved. This is best understood by verticals and segments. By verticals, Zix's strength is supported by growing regulation in the health and financial industry. By segments, Zix is strongly positioned to play in the mid-market space. Upstream, there are more competitors due to the presence of Mimecast (MIME), Proofpoint (PFPT), Symantec, and Barracuda. Across all segments, we have big tech companies offering e-mail security capabilities.We believe its improved sales capacity will drive sales volume and billings to support its cash flow. The cost of capital required to rejuvenate growth will no doubt weigh in on the payback period for common stockholders. This makes Zix a long-term play. Analysts have an average price target of $10/share. Given its double-digit revenue growth guidance and its subdued P/S multiple of 1.54x, Zix is underpriced.Zix needs to deliver its growth promise. It also needs to generate substantial cash flow from customers to fulfill its obligations to debt holders. If it doesn't execute to perfection, it will face liquidity risks.Zix needs to pick all the low-hanging fruit in the mid-market as fast as possible as major competitors are less focused on the mid-market. If competitors pay more attention to the mid-market, Zix's win rate might be impacted.The past quarters have been rocked by macro volatility. If this persists, Zix's ability to generate free cash flow will be impacted.Zix is an attractive investment when we focus on its improved growth factor powered by its product updates and strengthened sales force and partners. In an improved macro environment, Zix has the capabilities to deliver more value to shareholders. The current valuation shows significant potential for multiples expansion if things fall in place as projected.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4315885,35181,2020-01-08T22:28:02-05:00,Zix is a cybersecurity company focused on Email.Business pointed in the right direction now that AppRiver acquisition has settled down.Stock price is showing signs of life.This will be a good year for cybersecurity companies and Zix should do well.,"I wrote an article on Zix Corporation (ZIXI) back in August called Zix: The Mouse That Roared. At that time I was concerned about the company's oversized appetite, with the acquisition of AppRiver, another cybersecurity company. I was also concerned about the state of Zix's business prior to the acquisition, struggling with revenue growth which was ~7%, and customer retention rate which was 90% and declining. For these reasons, I gave Zix a neutral rating.Now after four months I find that Zix is in better shape with Y-o-Y organic Annual Revenue Growth (ARR) of 18% and greater than 100% Net Dollar Revenue Retention which has grown for three quarters.In addition, the slide in stock price appears to be over. After a recent double-bottom, the stock price is pushing higher.The stock price has reached a local resistance level of $7.50 and the stock price will likely bounce around in the $7 to $7.50 range until a convincing breakout occurs that takes the stock to the $10 level.Given the improved company fundamentals, extreme stock price undervaluation and positive movement in the stock price, I am revising my rating for Zix from neutral to bullish.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Zix is well under the trend line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is significantly better than its peers', given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Zix is extremely undervalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.I am not going to dwell too much on fundamentals due to the significant acquisition last year. Large acquisitions tend to skew the fundamentals. But it appears that Zix management is mindful of the Rule of 40% which I have covered in other articles, and Zix essentially meets the Rule of 40%.In addition, I have prepared a scatter plot that shows the company's SG&A expense margin (SG&A expense/sales) is typical of digital transformation companies.Four months ago I was concerned about the low revenue growth of 7%. It appears that revenue growth has stabilized and is in fact improving. In fact, the overall organic ARR growth has improved to 18% year over year.(Source: Zix 2019 Q3 earnings presentation slides)There are several reasons for the improvement, including the synergies between Zix and AppRiver that lead to cross-selling opportunities, as well as the Microsoft productivity suite which has turned out to be an excellent low-cost, lead generation tool.(Source: Zix 2019 Q3 earnings presentation slides)I am expecting that 2020 will be a big year for cybersecurity companies with not only the upcoming US presidential election, but also rising global tensions. There has been a lot of talk about Iran and the country's cyberterrorism capabilities.While software stock valuations have come down in recent months, they are still high on a historical basis. I would not dismiss the possibility of a dot-com-like crash in the future.There are other uncertainties, such as the rising tension in the Middle East, trade disputes, and President Trump's impeachment, which could cause a market downturn. Software stocks tend to get hit hard during any market turbulence.Zix is servicing a high debt level and could be sensitive to rising interest rates. Any misstep in terms of cash flow could result in a difficult situation.Zix appears to have settled down after the acquisition of AppRiver, with stabilized ARR growth of 18% and Net Dollar Revenue Retention greater than 100%.I believe that this stock is extremely undervalued based on my relative valuation technique and in my estimation, the stock price is likely to appreciate from its current $7.50, up into double-digits this year.Cybersecurity stocks should do well this year, given the US presidential election and increasing global tensions. Zix is primed to do well in this environment."
4270396,20715,2019-06-14T18:23:09-04:00,Zix Corporation provides email encryption and data loss prevention solutions.The company has made a turnaround in recent years and is now growing earnings and sales.Management efficiency measurements are well above average.The charts show how the rally has accelerated in recent years.,"During the tech-bubble in the 90s, there were many companies that jumped 500%, 1000% after they went public. Many of them were internet companies, but tech companies, in general, did extremely well and produced huge gains for investors. Of course, many of those same companies came crashing back down to Earth in the bear market of 2000-2002.Zix Corporation (ZIXI) is a pretty good example of the astronomical rally followed by an epic collapse. The software firm formed in 1988 and spent most of the 90s priced under $10 a share. In fact, on January 2, 1998, the stock opened at $4 even. By the end of 1999, the stock was trading right around $40 a share. It would eventually go as high as $96.50 in March 2000. We are talking about a 2,312% gain in just over two years - incredible.Of course, the flip side of that story is the dramatic fall. By the end of 2000, the stock was back down under $10. It would eventually drop to a low of $2.15 in July 2002 before eventually rebounding back up to $18.55 in April 2004. Unfortunately, the stock took another dramatic fall from 2004 through September 2006 and eventually bottomed at $0.51 a share.I hear the term ""parabolic"" used to describe huge jumps in stocks quite often, but to me, the phrase is being used incorrectly. A parabola is a shape that has two sides to it - the upward move and then the downward move or the downward move followed by the upward move. Most of the time when someone uses ""parabolic"" to describe a stock's performance, they are really referring to a huge rally and that isn't a parabolic shape at all. In the case of Zix, the shape of the chart really was a parabola.While that is the story of Zix in the late 90s and early 2000s, the company did survive and, in fact, has evolved and is doing well once again.Zix provides email encryption, data loss prevention (DLP), threat protection, and mobile security solutions to its clients. The Dallas-based company serves clients in the financial services, healthcare, and insurance industries as well as various governmental groups. The company was originally called ZixIt Corporation when it was founded in 1988, but it changed its name to just Zix Corporation in 2002.The company struggled in the first decade of the 21st century, but it has found its footing and has been doing quite well in the last few years. Zix has seen its earnings grow by 10% per year over the last three years, and analysts expect the company to see earnings growth of 24% this year.Sales have also increased by 10% per year over the last three years and they were up 76% on a year over year basis in the first quarter. Analysts are expecting a huge boost to sales in the second and third quarters with estimated increases of 155% and 157%.In addition to the earnings and sales growth, Zix has strong management efficiency measurements. The return on equity is at 33.4% and the profit margin is at 24.8% currently.When the bear market of 2007-2009 ended, Zix was trading around $1 a share. The stock has been trending higher ever since and from the beginning of 2011 through the end of 2018, the stock cycled higher within a pretty clearly defined trend channel. The lower rail connects the lows from 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018.The upper rail connects the highs from 2011, 2017, and 2018. As you can see on the chart above, the stock broke out above the trend channel earlier this year. In fact, if you connect the lows from 2018, you see how the rally has accelerated considerably since the beginning of 2018.Breaking it down even more and looking at the daily chart, we see that the stock appears to be moving higher within a new trend channel. The two lows from April connect with the recent low to form the lower rail of the channel, while the upper rail connects the highs from February and May.This channel isn't as clean as the weekly channel from 2011 through 2018, but it shows a pretty clearly defined upward trend, nevertheless.Looking at the sentiment toward Zix, there are only four analysts covering the stock currently and all four have the stock rated as a ""buy"". If we were talking about a company with 20 analysts following it and all 20 rated the stock as a buy that would be a red flag for me. However, because we are talking about a stock that is under $10 and only four analysts are following the stock, I don't mind that all of the ratings are buys. It leaves room for the stock to get additional coverage in the future.In previous articles about Vipshop (VIPS) and Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (SID), I have talked about how to read the sentiment toward low-priced stocks like these. It's rare to see a high short interest ratio when the stocks are trading under $15 because the shares become hard to borrow. Zix is no exception here either. The current short interest ratio is 1.33.The number of shares sold short has been rising over the past year, but that has been offset by a jump in the average daily trading volume. At the end of December, there were only 784,416 shares sold short, but the average daily trading volume was only 359,072. There are now 1,395,574 shares sold short, but the average daily trading volume has jumped to 1,044,001.The overall changes in shares sold short and average daily trading volume have caused the ratio to fall.I am pretty bullish on Zix. The company has made a big turnaround and now they are growing earnings and sales at a solid pace, and the management efficiency measurements are well above average.The trend on the chart is impressive and I love the way the rally has accelerated in 2019. I think the recent bounce off of the 50-day is a good sign for the stock and I expect it to continue its upward trend.Another factor in why I am bullish on Zix is the ongoing news of major data breaches, the various email hacking stories, and even the election interference during the 2016 election. All of these events drive businesses to increase their cyber-security and that should lead to more business for Zix. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) even partnered with Zix in 2014 to create Google Apps Message Encryption.Data theft and email spying aren't going to go away any time soon. If anything, they are only going to get worse as technology continues to change and as we incorporate technology into our everyday lives more and more. To me, this only means that companies like Zix continue growing well into the future.As for targets for Zix, the obvious first layer of resistance is the recent high at $11.15. I think the stock can take out that high without much of an effort. The next layer of resistance comes in the $18.50 area - the high from 2004. This resistance could be a little more difficult to take out, but I think the stock can move above it within the next few years. If it does move above the resistance, it could continue climbing up to the $35 to $40 range.One strategy investors can take, and I have done this with investments in my own portfolio, is to close half of the position at 100%. By closing half of the position at 100%, you have guaranteed yourself a breakeven trade no matter what happens from there. Even if the stock drops to zero, you would break even on the investment. But you also have half of the position open to collect more potential gains.In this case, the $18.50 area would mean a gain of approximately 100% from the current price and, like I said, it could act as resistance. Closing half of the position at that level makes a lot of sense."

E-mail security specialist Zix Corporation (NASDAQ:ZIXI) is positioned well to ride that trend if it can continue to execute well in a couple of areas.The vast majority of Zix's business is done in the U.S., and it targets the government, healthcare, education, financial services and insurance industries, offering a variety of services associated primarily with e-mail encryption. That includes compliance in a variety of industries, including HIPAA, GLBA, CFPB and FERPA.Along with e-mail encryption, Zix provides its over 19,000 customers with archiving, data loss prevention, threat protection and bring-your-own-device security.Zix has had a history of pushing up above the $5.00 per share mark, and then falling below that as time goes on. Going forward, the question is now that cybersecurity demand and compliance issues are trending in its favor, whether or not the company can sustainably generate revenue and earnings that will push it to new heights.with the headlines pointing out numerous security breaches, and the fines associated with failure to meet compliance and protect customers, students and patients, companies are increasingly looking to specialists like Zix for cybersecurity needs.That is evidenced by ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF, which has jumped by over 20 percent YTD, representing a wide swath of the cybersecurity industry.There's still room for the sector to grow, and I believe Zix has a good chance of breaking through the ceiling it has struggled to surpass in its history, as the momentum from the trend remains in its favor.The key will be winning more business from its installed base and being able to add more new customers than it loses to churn.Over the last five years Zix has been able to boost sales at an annual average of about 15 percent, or 65 percent total. It's not earthshaking, but it's not bad either. I think the time may have come where it will be rewarded for its consistent growth.Historically the company tends to push above $5.00 per share, and then fall back to a little above $3.00 per share.Revenue in the quarter was $16.7, up 5 percent year-over-year. GAAP net income was $1.9 million, up 7 percent, with GAAP fully diluted earnings per share up 7 percent, or $0.04. Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings was $0.08, a gain of 16 percent over the same reporting period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.8 million, a gain of 8 percent.Cash flow from operations fell to $1.0 million. The major reason for the decline measured against last year was a lower deferred revenue balance from its ""designed shorter contract term length.""Annual contract value finished at $68.4 million, an increase of 7 percent, and a record performance for the company. New first year orders climbed to $2.3 million, up 3 percent from last year. Overall orders jumped 7 percent to $14.8 million.Zix’s Chief Financial Officer David Rockvam said this about the quarter:CEO David Wagner cited putting together a full suite of services was a big part of the performance of the company, which should continue on into the future.He said:Zix said the three major revenue catalysts were its ""e-mail protection, bundled offerings and rapid adoption of our cloud based hosted encryption solution.""As for its balance sheet, the company had $29.3 million in cash with no debt at the end of the reporting period.The acquisition of Erado was for the purpose of responding to customer demand for bundled services related to ""unified archiving, supervision, security, and messaging solutions.""This will be a solution to those customers that are required to comply with SEC and FINRA regulations.It will also grow out Zix's cloud-based e-mail archiving capabilities to over 50 content channels. Those include ""social media, instant message, mobile, web, audio, and video.""Zix sees it a way to improve its relationships with legal and financial services customers. This is directly from the strength Erado has in the archiving business.Another key reason for the acquisition is Erado's 100 percent cloud-based architecture should be able have most of its functionality integrated into Zix's platform architecture. The company expects to complete the integration by the end of the year. This will help strengthen its archiving bundles. Zix sees the transition of archiving to the cloud as being subject to disruption. This is particularly true in the broker/dealer segment. Many small financial businesses need help with meeting FINRA and SEC requirements, as well as the ability to securely deliver e-mails and deal with advanced threats.The company also said it ""integrating the additional data channels and supervisory capability into our core ZixArchive product on the ZixCentral platform.""Zix has found in the past that cloud-based solutions also helps to keep some of the churn down.The company said in the earnings report that it is unlikely to return to the stickiness it enjoyed in 2016, where retention was in the mid-90s. It attributed the lower retention rate to ""shortening term of contracts in the market space and a lack of stickiness or the less stickiness in the advanced threat space....""It said that ""we think will be in the low 90s as opposed to mid 90s as our new normal."" That will be achieved by moving more customers to cloud-based services. That's one of the key metrics to watch going forward in regard to churn. Erado will play a key role in this area of the business.There are a couple of reasons I believe Zix will finally break out of its prior share price ceiling of about $5.50. They are the acquisition of Erado and what comes with that, and the strengthening of its bundles and cloud-based business.The company revised its guidance in response to the Erado acquisition. Revenue was upwardly adjusted by $1.5 million, bringing the total for the second quarter to a range of $17.3 million and $17.5 million, an increase of 6 percent to 7 percent year-over-year. Full-year revenue is guided to be from $69 million and $70.5 million, up 5 percent to 7 percent in comparison to full-year 2017. Presumably, in 2019 that should increase with an additional quarter of results added.Updated guidance for fully diluted GAAP earnings per share was from $0.15 and $0.16 and fully diluted non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share is expected to be at $0.30 for fiscal 2018.That suggests to me the share price bottom has increased, and the probability is even if it corrects, it won't be do the degree it has in the past, and in the stronger probability it retains some momentum, it will surpass its prior highs. Finally, while it is still working through additional churn as a result of its on-premise appliance customers, it is improving there, and that will show in the performance results in the near future.The more compelling bundles and the expansion of its cloud-based encryption business should incrementally improve its churn rate, keeping in mind it won't return to 2016 anytime soon.The good news is while it loses some customers to churn, the new customers are offsetting that, and the migration of customers to the cloud make it likely that the new customers will bring more revenue to the company as they buy more products as a result of marketing various solutions across its platform.For that reason I see Zix being able to continue to grow at a measured pace, and believe the market will reward it for the added revenue from the Erado acquisition, and the increase in sales from existing customers.Much of this integration will take until the latter part of the year to complete, but once it's in place it should bring the company up to the next level in revenue and earnings."
3039686,75175,2015-03-31T16:50:14-04:00,"Zix Corp. is a security company that has shown lackluster results, but is in a good position to reward patient investors.Its core markets - email encryption and BYOD - should see accelerated growth over the next few years.This is due to expanded OEM partnerships, recent healthcare regulations regarding digital security, and the growth of BYOD services among enterprises.","Zix Corp. (NASDAQ:ZIXI) is a security solutions company that has shown lackluster results lately, but is poised for significant growth, largely due to its favorable market position and OEM partnerships. Zix mainly provides email encryption, which has been one of the most talked-about tech issues of the past year, and into 2015. For industries such as healthcare, finance and government (read: Zix Corp.'s target markets), email encryption has been an issue for even longer. Yet, the company's revenue and customer growth rates haven't been particularly inspiring. Its revenue grew from $38.1M in 2011 to $50.35M for 2014, but its rate of growth has slowed from 15.36 percent to 4.59 percent, respectively. Earnings per share have been less than exciting as well, falling from $0.17 in 2013 to $0.07 last year. At this point, many investors seem to have grown tired of waiting for Zix to produce better results and have lost interest in the company. This is likely a premature dismissal; however, as Zix's two main services - encryption and BYOD - have been slow to develop. I believe that Zix is poised to see significant growth (and reward patient investors) due to the following factors:1. Zix's OEM partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is starting to show results, and its recently announced Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) deal has great potential, both for sales and brand awareness.2. The latest proposed healthcare regulations put additional emphasis on encryption, which play into Zix's core business.3. BYOD services adoption among enterprises is still low, which presents an opportunity for ZixOne.Let's examine each of these in more detail.1. OEM PartnershipsZix is not a well-known company (outside of the niche encryption industry) and its technology largely plays out behind the scenes. It makes sense for the company then to pursue OEM relationships both as a revenue source and a way to build brand awareness.It formalized a significant OEM relationship last year with Google as the Google Apps Message Encryption (GAME) system. These sales started in earnest in October (after changes on Google's end to its Apps system), but helped Zix double its OEM sales from Q3. According to its latest earnings report, OEM sales from Symantec (SYMC) and Google represented 10 percent of its new first-year orders for Q4. Given a full year of sales, this partnership should make a larger impact during 2015.Additionally, Zix announced a new OEM partnership with Cisco in early March. The partnership will revolve around two products - an update to Cisco's IronPort Encryption Appliance that's targeted at enterprises, and a new solution combining Cisco and Zix technology (probably related to BYOD). Having Cisco as an OEM partner, even more so than Google, should boost Zix's presence in the enterprise security market.2. Continued Emphasis on Healthcare EncryptionThe healthcare market is a major driver of growth for Zix. In 2014, it made up 48 percent of its new first-year orders. This demand should continue (or grow) due to the latest Meaningful Use guidelines proposed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).Meaningful Use is the regulation and certification system that the CMS uses to award financial incentives to eligible providers. Soon, any providers who accept Medicaid or Medicare will need to be compliant with these regulations or face reductions in government reimbursements.The latest guidelines put additional emphasis on electronic communication between physicians and patients and on protecting patient health information (PHI). The first objective laid out by the CMS is better security around PHI, including the encryption of communications and records. The regulations also state that healthcare providers will need to conduct risk analysis regarding their electronic security.According to DataMotion's latest security survey, approximately 25 percent of healthcare organizations said they lack the ability to currently encrypt their email. This suggests there's still a significant market for email encryption among healthcare providers.The CMS' emphasis on protecting patient information, along with providers' lack of adequate technology, plays directly into Zix's core business of email encryption. Zix already has a foothold in the healthcare industry - it is used by 30+ Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations - and should be able to leverage these regulations into increased sales.3. BYOD OpportunitiesZix's latest product is its BYOD application ZixOne, which helps enterprises control their corporate email on employees' personal devices. During 2014, the overall number of ZixOne customers rose to 264, with approximately 18,000 total seats. Just 40 percent of these customers represented new accounts for Zix, suggesting that ZixOne is mainly being sold as an add-on for existing enterprise clients.These numbers are solid, if relatively unimpressive. However, overall BYOD service adoption rates among enterprises have been slow as well. According to a recent report from Flexera Software and IDC, just 28 percent of enterprises have BYOD policies - let alone specific solutions. Another 53 percent though are either currently implementing a solution or have plans to implement within the next 12-24 months. This suggests that 2015-2017 will be a critical period of growth for current BYOD solutions. ZixOne is well positioned to capitalize on this growing market.In SummaryFor patient investors, Zix presents a good opportunity for long-term growth. The company could still do more in certain areas, such as marketing and general sales. Zix is essentially unknown outside of its niche industry and would likely benefit from a longer-term brand awareness campaign - especially for its newer product line.However, its continued development of OEM partnerships bodes well for future growth, and to a lesser extent, brand awareness among enterprises. The healthcare industry should also provide a steady stream of new clients, as lagging healthcare providers assess their security measures and move to implement encryption services. Finally, ZixOne is positioned on the ground floor of a market (BYOD services) that's set to accelerate in the next one to two years. Despite what many see as lackluster management, Zix would seemingly have to struggle to lose over the next two to three years, given its market positioning and product lineup."
3542476,63483,2015-10-01T09:31:53-04:00,"At 4.4x EV/sales, shares of Zix Corporation are expensive on an absolute basis. Relative to close comp MobileIron, they are dramatically overvalued.Following MOBL's Q1 warning, the firm fell 35% due to fears of increased competition from heavyweights such as Microsoft and VMware.Zix did not follow MOBL's lead - shares continued rising after MOBL's warning, and only fell slightly due to an analyst downgrade and a poor Q2.The market appears to be ignoring the fact that Microsoft and VMware are also Zix's competitors. Low-ROI R&D/meager growth indicates intensifying competition/growth is unlikely to accelerate.The Google deal/Cisco's exit & collaboration seems unlikely to yield the benefits expected. If Zix trades in-line with MOBL, shares would see 70%+ downside from current levels.","ThesisShares of Zix Corporation (NASDAQ:ZIXI) are a compelling short at current levels. Specifically, it is my view that shares are an enticing short because:Ultimately, my thesis essentially boils down to this - the bull case is misguided. Zix trades like a high-growth stock despite mere single-digit growth. Increasing competition would result in limited opportunities to grow and investors should not expect a substantial acceleration in the top-line to stem organically given the company's history of product flops (ZixDLP/ZixOne).With limited probability of being bought out by a competitor, and high unlikelihood of results exploding positively, it is my view that potential for shares of Zix to move parabolically higher is severely reduced. Couple this with the fact that a much faster-growing peer (MobileIron) trades at a ~3 turn EV/sales discount, shorting Zix seems compelling here.Company DescriptionGiven the presence of large amounts of publicly-available research on Zix and its industry (EMM/security is a very hot industry at the moment given the numerous data breaches experienced by many organizations recently), I will keep my description brief.Zix operates in the high-growth (though the firm does not seem to be benefiting from this growth) EMM/security industry. The company's main product is email encryption. Given the fact that email is the communication medium of choice for businesses, and that Zix's email encryption offering does not require user authentication, customers tend to be sticky and revenues highly recurring. In addition to email encryption, the firm also has additional offerings such as email data loss prevention (""ZixDLP"") and other BYOD (""ZixOne"") solutions.MOBL's Q1 warning led to a massive selloff, but Zix barely moved following the reportIn April, MOBL issued a Q1 warning, trimming guidance slightly. Given the relatively small haircut (guidance was ~3-5% lower), one could have justified a small selloff. Yet, shares fell 35% following the warning. MOBL cited increasing competition from a number of large players, notably Microsoft and VMware, but the list includes other tech mammoths such as IBM and SAP as well. Clearly, the reason for the huge selloff (instead of a small one) was due to increasing competition.Following a weak Q1 was a soft Q2. Despite beating Q2 estimates, guidance was once again slightly trimmed, and increasing competition was once again cited. Shares of MOBL fell ~8% following the Q2 report.Why does this concern Zix? Simple. As seen in Zix's recent investor presentation, the company cites Proofpoint, VMware and MOBL as competitors.Notably, VMware/MOBL are only cited as competitors in the BYOD market, which is not Zix's crown jewel. This may be a factor contributing to the stock's mispricing - investors could have possibly reasoned that although Zix faces competition, this competition is in one of Zix's smaller offerings.Moreover, the slides do not mention Microsoft/VMware as a competitor within email encryption (Zix's crown jewel). As the reader will learn in the next few paragraphs, the situation is much more dire than implied by the company.Bad news for MOBL is equivalent to bad news for Zix. Yet, shares of Zix soared following MOBL's April Q1 warning (possibly aided by its share buyback program) and have only recently retreated due to a weak Q2 and an analyst downgrade.It is important to note that Zix's email encryption offering is its crown jewel - the offering accounted (and continues to account) for a majority of the top-line (numbers to illustrate this will be provided in a later section). Though the company frequently alludes to the massive market opportunity, it has little growth to show for it (revenues have been growing at mid to high single-digits, not exactly exploding), leading one to wonder - if the opportunity is so large, why can't Zix capitalize on it?One word: competition. Microsoft and VMware, with their entry into the EMM space, have also created their own email encryption offering. Microsoft's offering is known as ""Office 365 Message Encryption"" (it seems to be integrated with its cloud productivity suite and Azure platform) while VMware's offering is called ""CipherMail Email Encryption Gateway"". A brief reading of their descriptions reveals striking similarities with Zix's email encryption offering.Here is how Microsoft describes Office 365 Message Encryption:And how VMware describes CipherMail Email Encryption Gateway:And finally, here is how Zix describes its email encryption offering:Considering Microsoft's and VMware's dominance in corporate productivity/virtualization respectively, I believe it is safe for me to assert without fear of being refuted that Microsoft and VMware are likely to dominate the email encryption space going forward.These players have client bases that dwarfs Zix's, much more widely-known brand names, and drastically higher R&D and marketing budgets. In case the reader is unconvinced, Microsoft's EMM customers jumped 90% y/y to 17K+ while VMware's AirWatch (its EMM offering) rose 60% on a constant currency basis. Contrasting this with Zix's paltry single-digit/low double-digit growth, the story does not look good.The sheer differential between their growth rates suggests that clients are simply looking for a complete solution (email encryption with a productivity suite in Microsoft's case and email encryption with virtualization in VMware's case), not a point product (ala Zix). This certainly explains why Zix is unable to grow past single-digit rates.Low-ROI/relatively small-scale R&DZix has consistently been spending ~$9m-$10m annually on R&D. This spending has resulted in the development of two new offerings: ZixDLP (email data loss prevention) and ZixONE (BYOD). Despite new product introductions, their contributions to revenue have been minuscule.From the Q4 FY14 conference call (emphasis mine):Fast forward two quarters to the most recent quarter (Q2 FY15, emphasis mine):From the above commentary, the unsuspecting reader would probably be thinking that the company is experiencing huge momentum. However, if we put the above numbers into perspective, it appears that this ""momentum"" is nothing to write home about.From Q4 FY14 to Q2 FY15, ZixDLP customers grew from 84 to 119 while seats grew from 155,000 to 186,000. Over the same period, ZixOne customers grew from 264 to 393 while seats grew from 18,000 to 26,000. If we put these growth numbers in percentages, it seems like these offerings are growing very quickly. However, these numbers are infinitesimal compared to Zix's core email encryption offering. Per the July 2015 investor presentation, the email encryption offering had a customer base of 12,000 and ~2.7m seats (paid end users). Any way you slice it, revenue contribution from ZixDLP/One is immaterial.Notably, average seats per customer for ZixOne (the highest price-point offering: $33/seat for ZixOne vs ~$20/seat for the core email encryption offering and ~$4/seat for ZixDLP), actually decreased from Q4 FY14 to Q2 FY15 (68 to 66, data sourced from the quotes above), suggesting at the very least that the company's client base does not seem to be too excited about deploying its solution enterprise-wide. This trend is also present for Zix's DLP offering (data sourced from quotes above) - in Q4 FY14 Zix had 84 DLP customers and 155,000 seats or 1845 seats/customer on average. Two quarters later (Q2 FY15), Zix had 119 DLP customers and 186,000 seats or 1563 seats/customer on average.The above trend suggests one of two things (likely both):Either way, the Zix story does not look good. The narrative becomes even more dreadful if one considers the fact that Zix's R&D/marketing budget is a fraction of that of its competitors (Microsoft, VMware, etc). Talk about bringing a knife to a gun-fight.The apparent bull case for ZixThe curious reader would then wonder: if the story is so bad, why are shares priced so highly?The bull case for Zix is fairly apparent. The company has strategic partnerships with OEM leaders such as Google, Cisco, and Symantec. The firm clearly considers these names as their best partners given that they specifically list them in their investor presentation (slide 28).These players have huge networks and client bases. With Zix partnering up with them, it is not hard to come up with the case for owning Zix. To illustrate the bull case in numbers, Zix claims that Cisco has a distribution network of 68,000 resellers while Zix has a network of only 300 (per Q1 FY15 earnings call transcript).Additionally, Cisco was originally a competitor to Zix, but has exited the space in 2012. In July of that year, Cisco announced the end of its IronPort encryption solution but promised to continue to issue maintenance releases until July 2015. Couple this with the firm's partnership with Zix (in early 2015), one can assert that it is likely that Zix will be able to capitalize on former Cisco's customers' need to migrate over to the new provider.Following these developments (largely occurred during 2014/early 2015), shares of Zix rose substantially from $3 to $5. Clearly, investors were pinning their hopes on Zix's partnerships with Cisco, Google, and others.Reason for the mispricing - the bull case is misguidedDespite the positive developments listed above, Zix does not appear to be benefiting much, if at all, from any of them. Year-over-year revenue growth rates remain in the single-digits quarter after quarter. What's more revealing is that revenue was flat sequentially (at ~$13m) over the past 5 quarters (per Morningstar data). Clearly, nothing in Zix's recent results suggests any near-term explosion in growth.In addition, the firm attributed poor growth at the end of Q4 FY14 to a delay in ramp-up from Google resellers. Q1 FY15 was the first quarter where the company experienced a full 3-month contribution from Google resellers (emphasis mine):Yet, revenue barely budged on a sequential basis - Q4 FY14 revenues were $12.9m while Q1 FY15 revenues were $13.1m. Clearly, even with the aid of Google's reseller network, Zix did not perform at a level that would justify the rise in shares ($3 to $5) in 2014.Despite the apparent poor contribution from strategic partnerships, management comments continue to be upbeat overall, with numerous claims alluding to the possibility that the top-line is on the cusp of exploding. From the Q1 FY15 call (emphasis mine):Notably, the company mentioned that it will begin accepting orders from Cisco's installed base later this quarter (the Q1 FY15 quarter). To ascertain their progress, we need to look no further than the second quarter numbers (or the most recent quarter). The numbers are underwhelming to say the least: new orders grew to $2.5m or a mere 5.5% y/y. Despite this poor performance, management continues to be very positive about the company's future (per their comments on the call).In sum, I believe that the bull case (that the Cisco/Google partnership will result in an explosion in the top-line) is misguided. Probably the two best validators of my bear thesis are as follows:My theory as to why Zix's top-line has been unable to gain traction is rather simple.The company offers point products - products that are meant to address a single problem. Its email encryption offering, ZixOne and ZixDLP are all centered on solving a single problem - email security.However, the data (flat revenue sequentially, single-digit top-line growth rates, declining average seat/customer, etc) suggests that enterprises are not looking for point products, they are looking for solutions.This view is supported by the fact that Microsoft and VMware (who most certainly offer solutions, not point products) have managed to grow their EMM offerings by high double-digits (90%+ for Microsoft and 60% for VMware on a constant-currency basis), far outpacing Zix's meager single-digit growth.Furthermore, Zix is clearly continuing to focus on email - the recent release of ZixDLP is evidence of that. By continuing to myopically concentrate on just email - a small segment of the overall EMM space - Zix will likely be unable to compete against competitors which provide more complete EMM solutions. In fact, it will be nearly impossible, considering the level of Zix's R&D/marketing budgets compared to its rivals.Relative valuationAt ~$50m in annual revenues and ~$28m in net cash, Zix currently trades at ~4.4x EV/sales. In contrast, MOBL currently trades for 1.1x EV/sales (~$130m in revenue and ~$100m in net cash). Both companies share striking similarities: they are about the same size (~$250m) and both operate in the high-growth EMM space (though out of the two, only MOBL seems to be benefiting from the growth trend). MOBL's stock has been thrashed recently, largely due to weak guidance and increasing competition. Given my above commentary regarding Zix, I see no reason Zix will not eventually follow the path of MOBL as increasing competition would also harm Zix.Although one might attribute the valuation discrepancy to the difference between the company's offerings, this assertion does not hold merit. MOBL is arguably much better positioned competitively compared to Zix, given that MOBL provides a more complete solution (unlike Zix, it is not simply focused on email) than Zix. Due to this, MOBL has enjoyed much higher growth rates (20%-30%) compared to Zix (6%-10%). One can reasonably make the case that MOBL should trade at a premium multiple to Zix, not the other way around.One other bone of contention the reader could raise is as follows: Zix is profitable while MOBL is not. While true, this argument does not hold water as one needs to consider that as these companies operate in a high-growth industry, it is very likely that they are priced basedon their growth profile, not their profitability.I believe a reasonable base case is that Zix trades in-line with MOBL. At MOBL's EV/sales multiple, Zix would see ~75% downside from current levels. As alluded to above, there is no reason why Zix can't trade lower, given its weaker growth profile and poorer competitive position.CatalystsThe main catalyst that would push shares lower would be a continued single-digit revenue growth rate going forward (i.e. no explosion to the top-line).Shares of Zix rose sharply (from $3 to $5) as a result of the announced Google/Cisco partnerships. In prior sections, I have detailed why it is highly unlikely Zix would reap much benefit from these partnerships.I expect continued single-digit growth in the following quarters to be proof of this and result in investors adjusting their growth expectations for the firm, which would lead to a drop in Zix's share price.Risks & conclusionEssentially, my bearish view on Zix is based on the fact that the company trades at a sky-high valuation despite a sluggish growth profile, something that is unlikely to continue going forward.Its growth profile is likely to remain weak given increasing competition from very large players (Microsoft, VMware, etc). The company's small R&D/marketing budgets relative to the aforementioned tech giants places it at an insurmountable disadvantage. Although management continues to be optimistic about Zix's future, their aggressive selling of Zix's shares contradicts their upbeat comments.With little reason for operations to accelerate, poor competitive positioning, and a stratospheric valuation, the likelihood of Zix getting acquired is substantially mitigated. Shares are unlikely to rise further as well for similar reasons. With limited downside and huge upside potential (75%+), shares of Zix seem like a compelling short."
2795215,76425,2015-01-04T05:12:59-05:00,Zix has a resale channel with Google that was recently initiated.ZIX is picking up business from customers that were left hanging by Cisco.Zix has a new product that may be a game changer.All of the catalysts are unproven.,"Zix Corporation (NASDAQ:ZIXI) offers email encryption products. Key drivers for encryption demand have been legal requirements to scramble patient records when transmitted over the internet and the increasing menace of cyber hacking. The healthcare sector was 50% of sales, followed by finance at 25% and government at 6%.ZIXI's earnings report in October, for the third quarter came in short on revenues and the stock took a 20% haircut. It has rebounded since then.Here are the reasons why the stock has rebounded:The reseller channel with Google has begun selling after a delayed launch.ZIXI claims that they are gaining sales from customer displacement from Cisco's IronPort Encryption Appliance.ZixOne a Bring-Your-Own-Device that was launched in September offers ease of use unlike other products currently in the marketplace.ZIXI is coming up on lists for best microcap investments for 2015 but I am cautious.Institutional interest in ZIXI waned during the last quarter as interest decreased by almost 1.7 million shares. For me, this is a red flag. Institutional investors are usually ahead of the pack on their way in as well as on their way out.So let's evaluate the three catalysts mentioned above that are driving the price higher and see why hedge funds are selling.The first catalyst is the reseller deal for GAME - Google Apps Message Encryption program for the Google Apps infrastructure. Clear guidance or clarification was not provided by the company during the last earnings call. CEO Richard Spurr is hopeful that ZIXI will see growing revenues from this deal but did not provide much clarity. This is what he said,The second catalyst is new business gained from the displacement in Cisco's IronPort Encryption Appliance. Once again, not much clarity was offered. During the earnings call, when prompted by an analyst, CFO Michael English said that there were between 100 and 200 enterprises that have been or will be affected by the termination on IronPort which will cease to exist in July. When pressed, Mr. English said that ZIXI has so far captured more than five but less than twenty of these customers.The third catalyst is that ZixOne is a potential displacement technology offering a unique BOYD solution that offers employees access to work related e-mail without having to download any software or suffer any impact on their privacy. ZIXI has a patent pending on this technology and believes that this market segment is larger than the rest of their business combined. So far, the company has reported signing on 169 new customers. Only one third are new customers, indicating that ZixOne is more of an add on option to most companies.The quarterly results for revenue and new first year orders were below what the company expected to achieve, coming in at $12.7 million, up from $12.2 million in the same quarter last year, but below guidance numbers. New first year orders for the third quarter were $1.6 million, compared to $2.2 million in the prior year quarter and $2.4 million in preceding quarter. CEO Richard Spurr said, ""We do not think this slowdown is due to any systematic issues and are seeing return to normal activity."" Without an understanding on what caused the revenue miss, or what impact the Google resale channel will have, a dwindling opportunity to catch displaced Cisco customers, ZixOne's failure to capture market share and institutional selling, I think its a good time to keep ZIXI on watch to see how things play out."
3979068,89965,2016-06-01T08:42:43-04:00,"Company possesses a strong balance sheet and even stronger cash flow generating power.
        Protective moat is dwindling.
        Mgmt team seems to lack creativity to boost company into overdrive.","Zix Corporation (NASDAQ:ZIXI) has a balance sheet that reads as one of the simplest in the industry; a strong cash position, hardly anything tied up in capitalized PP&E (rare for a tech company), sizeable DTA, large deferred revenue position (with even larger backlog), no debt, and the scars of the now-shrinking accumulated deficit from years past. With roughly $25M sitting in cash on their balance sheet at all times, this company appears to be safe in a short-term crunch. Moreover, it's the $48M deferred tax asset which sticks out the most as that is mainly comprised of NOL's remaining from the bad years in the early 2000's. Furthermore the amount on the balance sheet only represents the amount the company expects to use and another $46M sits reserved off-balance sheet and could be reclaimed with improved operating results in the near future. For a deeper dive into this a good explanation sits in the footnotes to the company's most recent 10-K but the gist is that they may only use NOL carryforwards as long as they have income to apply it to, and right now the company only expects to use roughly half before they expire. These would further reduce income tax expense and reduce the amount of cash outlay, further returning more cash to the company in the form of tax savings.In a nutshell this company is a cash-producing machine. Ample amounts are already committed each year to R&D and top-line revenues continue to grow at a steady pace thanks to new and returning customers. Margins remain intact, consistently hitting 25-30% OCF of revenues; that equates to upwards of $15M a year in free cash flows. On $55M in revenues that is an incredible return! It's clear that with minimal changes this company is already producing returns at a healthy clip and remains a solid business unit for today's security-focused tech world.The current Enterprise Value calculation shows $199M as of 3/31/16 and has been hovering between $190-220M in recent years (roughly 13x undiscounted cash flows at current levels). I might also argue that any DTA effects should be considered, albeit at an appropriately discounted rate, as these are direct tax savings both in a GAAP and cash-basis sense, and would be a benefit, thereby lowering EV (for the sake of this article no consideration has been given to the value of the DTA's).In recent years the company has spent over $70M in share repurchases but to what effect? One might expect for the overall market cap to remain fairly flat and as a result, the share price to increase following these repurchases. Unfortunately the share price has not moved much with the market clearly being comfortable with a price in the $3's and $4's and rarely testing the upward range. That being said the company has effectively reduced their own market cap and overall EV with these repurchases, which I think should cause some concern with management. With book value consistently near $1 were they really out of ideas of what to do with all this excess cash that purchasing shares at 4x BV and reducing overall shareholder value was the answer? In effect they have reduced their own protective moat to stave off being acquired, making them cheaper and more attractive to a potential buyer.Over the last several years the management has shown little creativity in trying to create growth and explore new opportunities. With all that cash at their disposal each year the best thing they could come up with was repurchasing shares at an inflated value? I would have preferred to see management pursue a strategic acquisition to add a complementary product or even just snap up and competitor and add to their own backlog. Following the news of the former CEO stepping down last year and the company hiring a new CEO only time will tell on whether he brings new ideas and direction but one can hope. Most leadership teams would love to have a clean balance sheet and constant cash flows in order to explore new opportunities, I only hope the company tries a new direction in the coming years.If the stock price continues to languish or if the company continues to shoot themselves in the foot by reducing their own EV, they should be wary of bigger players willing to snap them up on the cheap as they could provide a profitable base for a company looking to get into this market, or just add to their existing operations for players already in this arena."
4100805,103506,2017-08-21T18:19:39-04:00,Zix has seen some of the highest amounts of growth in its industry at 10% and is the leader in its area.A strong balance sheet will help Zix carry out additional acquisitions or withstand adverse economic conditions.90% retention rate of customers help Zix focus on attracting new customers.,"As the costs of cyber attacks continue to increase, so will the need for email security. Zix Corporation (ZIXI) is the leader in email security and protects both inbound and outbound. With strong growth in revenue as well as a robust balance sheet, Zix will continue to see growth in the future because of its acquisition of Greenview Data and the increasing amount of cyber attacks.The FBI reported that more than $3B has been stolen in the past three years from business email compromise scams. It’s becoming increasingly important for businesses to have a strong defense against cyber attacks in order to protect their information and avoid the costs of losing customers personal information. The number of attacks is only rising, with over 400 businesses being targeted by email compromise scams every day. This is a negative thing for businesses but positive for Zix as the more companies that come under threat of a cyber attack the more customers they will attract.Zix operates on a subscription-based model, with cash being collected upfront on an annual basis. Contracts typically have three-year terms, but around 90% of businesses renew their contracts. Not one customer accounts for more than 2% of revenue as well, making their business model more reliable.Zix’s business depends on it continuing to be the leader in email security. As such, investors should keep an eye on their R&D expenses and notice how much they are devoting to their research. Their most recent quarter showed an increase in their R&D spending, increasing from $2.3M to $2.7M. This is due in part to developing new technologies, as well as the increase in the number of employees because of the Greenview Data acquisition. Despite the increase in R&D spending, their overall operating expenses decreased 8.1%. This is due to decreased SG&A expenses. As Zix becomes a more established company, they are becoming better at controlling their costs and we can see the effect of that on their operating expenses. Their reduced costs have also translated into a tremendous amount of growth in their net income and increased 49% from 2016 to 2017.One of the more attractive things about Zix is the fact that they have no debt. With $29.5M in cash/investments, they can continue capitalizing on opportunities that occur or withstand negative market conditions.With 10% growth in revenue in 2016, Zix is one of the fastest-growing cyber security companies in the industry. A price/sales ratio of 4.51 is also lower than its competitors, such as Microsoft (MSFT) 6.21 and Proofpoint (PFPT) 8.8. Zix’s stock price remains near their 52-week high of $5.28, but I believe that it is currently undervalued for the price it’s trading at. If it experiences a dip in the future it may be a good time to swoop in and seize this opportunity.In March 2017, Zix acquired Greenview Data for $6.5M cash. Greenview Data is another email security company that also deals with advanced threat protection, antivirus, and antispam capabilities. This deal will allow Zix to expand their market into these additional areas to complement their email security services.Source: Zix CorporationAs you can see from the visual, the increase that Zix will see from this acquisition is much more valuable than the cost. Zix will now be able to sell additional products to their existing customers in order to produce more revenue per customer and increase their profits. This deal will also attract and retain more customers as Zix is able to offer a broad solution suite and address the entire business email market from enterprise to small businesses.Zix is primarily an email security company. While the vast majority of people continue to use email for their means of messaging, this dynamic is shifting into other messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger (FB), Whatsapp, Slack, and Skype. As the security for these platforms improves, the less likely people will be willing to spend money on email security.As the largest customer accounts for 2% of their revenue, Zix relies on acquiring new customers in order to continue to grow their business. If the pricing on Zix products increases or customers sees a decrease in their satisfaction in their products, this will adversely affect Zix’s revenue. As existing customers have no contractual obligation to continue their service beyond their contract, Zix has to continue to remain competitive both in their product offerings as well as their pricing. One of their largest competitors is Google (GOOG), a large blue chip stock with the capital to drive down the price of their email security products in order to grow their market share. If Google ever decides that Zix is becoming too big of a competitor for them, it would be very easy for them to try to drive Zix out of the market.Since Zix operates in the cyber security industry, they are constantly defending against cyber attacks daily. If one attack manages to successfully break through their defenses, Zix customers may lose confidence in their ability to provide email security effectively. Negative publicity, interrupted service, damage to their reputation, and disclosure of personal information are all effects that could happen should a cyber breach occur.Since Zix is a small-cap company, they still have much room to grow. With a market cap of $285M, they are considerably smaller than their competition. But their size allows them to specialize their product offerings to fit their consumers and enhance their experience. This is part of what allows Zix to maintain a customer retention rate of 90%. With their recent acquisition of Greenview Data, Zix is expanding their market into advanced threat protection and will allow it to grow beyond what they were capable of before. The fact that Zix has no debt on their balance sheets is the cherry on top for this company, and they are able to be flexible going forward regarding capital allocation."
3284875,63483,2015-06-25T18:34:37-04:00,"Cloud email encryption service provider.Narrow moat stemming primarily from scale, switching costs and network effects.Growth opportunities are driven by regulatory drivers.Valuation remains too rich for my liking.","Pop quiz: Name the number one source of data loss among corporations?Most people would probably come up with an answer that revolves around a device (laptops, mobile phones, USB drives, etc).Interestingly enough, email is the main source of data loss, according to research.Email is used on a daily basis by individuals, corporations and governments in order to communicate quickly and at minimal cost. This practice is especially prominent within corporations. In the current technological age, it is safe to say that email remains a mission-critical function for most, if not all businesses.Therein lies the problem.If email is not secured once it has left the sender's network, it can be intercepted along the path from the sender to the recipient, resulting in theft, manipulation or redirection, inter alia. In these situations, it is not difficult to imagine the adverse consequences that are likely to manifest as a result.Zix CorporationZix (NASDAQ:ZIXI) has the solution. The firm provides SaaS-based email encryption services to corporations. Its customer base consists largely of organizations operating within the healthcare (51%), financial (30%) and public (7%) sectors.The company's solution is simple. It acts as an intermediary between sender and recipients. Parties to an email join Zix's network where email is automatically encrypted and decrypted, solving the problem of data loss.Additionally, it also is extremely convenient. Senders/recipients are not required to input authentication codes or anything of the sort in order to read/send email. This ease-of-use is the company's main differentiator compared to its peers.The firm's revenue model is rather simple. It charges subscription fees on a per-user basis. More users, more fees. These fees also are relatively small ($20 per user), which could allow the company some room for increases in pricing in the future.Narrow moat stemming primarily from scale, switching costs and network effectsI opine that the company has a narrow moat. This moat stems primarily from scale, switching costs and network effects, all of which are not particularly significant at the present time, primarily due to the company's small size.A competitor looking to enter the email encryption space would require minimal upfront capital investment (annual R&D for Zix has yet to breach $15m in recent years) and can simply copy the ""intermediary"" model that Zix has pioneered, along with the ancillary services that the company provides. Although I'm not a software guru, I submit that it probably wouldn't take years to develop a competitive offering. It is true that a competitor would have to operate at a loss for quite some time before achieving scale, but in absolute terms, the losses would not be that large (probably less than $50m).Fortunately, switching costs and network effects are present.As switching to an alternate service provider would result in operational disruption, customers are unlikely to leave Zix for a competitor unless there are very compelling reasons to. Additionally, Zix's solution does the job it is meant to do rather well. Hence, there is little need to even consider an alternative.As more members are ""recruited"" into Zix's network, the network becomes more valuable. This is because it is only through using the network can email be encrypted and decrypted with minimal user input/inconvenience. However, I posit that these network effects are probably not particularly significant at the moment.In a nutshell, we have a business that:Now, qualitative discussion is all well and good, but such a discussion needs to be grounded in reality. In this case, the numbers do support the narrative. Perhaps the best manifestation of the above three points are retention rates. Retention rates have consistently exceeded 90% year after year. As the company is still in the growth stage (sales/marketing spend are still rather large), it is not meaningful to form conclusions on the basis of EBITDA margins.Growth opportunities are driven by regulatory driversThe astute reader would have picked up on the fact that the majority of Zix's customers are those within the financial and healthcare sector. This is not a mere coincidence. Legislation such as the HITECH, HIPAA (for the healthcare sector) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Acts drive the adoption of email encryption services.Despite the presence of such regulation, the adoption rate remains low in the aforementioned sectors. Only 25% of US banks and 20% of US hospitals use Zix's services. Therefore, the market for email encryption remains largely untapped, presenting an opportunity for Zix to increase its market penetration.RisksHowever, I postulate that Zix faces several firm-specific risks. The primary risk is the company's slowing growth. In the past five years, the company clocked in a mere 9% CAGR. Sales/marketing spend has increased meaningfully but has not resulted in the growth that one would expect.A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation results in a potential total market size of $5.6b (0.945 x 300 x 20, assuming a 5.5% unemployment rate, population of 300m & $20 per user) in the US alone. With such a large market size, one would think that Zix would be growing revenues at triple digits, but this has not been the case.Although the firm has partnerships with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which should in theory increase brand recognition and result in an explosion in the top-line, this has yet to occur. The company continues to increase its sales/marketing spend, but I remain cautious as to whether it would result in the top-line growth the company desperately needs. The market potential is clearly present, thus poor execution seems to be the culprit here.Valuation remains too rich for my likingAlthough the cybersecurity industry has been exploding in terms of growth, Zix does not seem to be along for the ride. Investors clearly have high expectations for the company as they have priced the company at 75x earnings.Zix continues to generate stable free cash flow but does not seem to have any prudent place to allocate capital. The company has an authorized buyback program, but with the stock at such stratospheric valuations, I doubt returns on the program would be significant. Due to a negative retained earnings number, dividends are out of the question as well. Even if the company was permitted to issue dividends, it does not generate enough cash flow to fund even a consistent 3% dividend yield (largely due to its current valuation). The company could very well increase its sales/marketing spend, but such efforts do not seem to be bearing fruit.Hence, I would advise investors to avoid Zix for a moment until the stock experiences a significant pullback or the company manages to reinvigorate consistent double-digit top-line growth."
3267295,89965,2015-06-18T08:51:57-04:00,"Is management willing to explore creative solutions?Investors seeking maximum value, could be growing impatient with results.Strong metrics but lacking the final touch.","Zix Corp (TICKER: ZIXI) is an innovator and market leader in email encryption services with top notch product offerings in today's technology-driven environment. In recent years they have produced consistent financial performance with a strong cash position and cash flow generation as well as no debt on the books; but Zix still has ghosts in the closet from the past.Zix encountered problems in the early and mid-2000's and incurred significant losses, thus racking up a large accumulated deficit. The Company was able to right the ship and a closer look at recent year's annual report would show the Company is once again profitable and able to generate sizeable free cash flows. This is encouraging but still a long ways away from conquering the mountain of deficit that still exists. This deficit weighs heavily as it is discouraging to investors and restricts the Company to certain activities, such as the inability to declare a dividend while a deficit remains, which I will discuss later. This is where a quasi-reorganization could benefit the company.In simple terms, a quasi-reorganization is an accounting provision which allows a company to eliminate its accumulated deficit by taking a surplus out of the Additional Paid-In Capital (""APIC"") account to get retained earnings back to zero, provided there is a surplus in APIC to cover the deficit amount (cannot drive APIC negative). Per the Company's most recent 10Q filing at 3/31/15 there is more than enough, and would leave approx. $125M in the APIC account should they decide to do so. Furthermore, if the Company were concerned with the APIC account looking depleted it could sell the treasury shares it currently holds at an average cost of $3.71/share and any excess above that price will go to APIC, thus restoring some of the balance. An act like this must be approved by the Board of Directors and furthermore by the stockholder's, and retained earnings will subsequently be dated for the following 10 years to indicate this transaction occurred. The question is: would this be seen as an overly aggressive move or would it free up the Company to have options for how to deploy resources to best serve its existing shareholders.The provision was intended to provide a Company with a fresh start after accumulating a large deficit, rather than trying to slowly dig out of the deficit they are in. Many times it can take years to build a retained earnings balance only for it to evaporate in a few bad years. It's still a bit taboo in practice, but it has been done before by such companies as Lockheed Martin. If the Company does nothing and continues to slowly dig away at the deficit balance it could take upwards of 25-40 years based on the most recent results.Cash FlowsBut if this all flipped tomorrow and there were no more limitations, what would the Company do with their cash flows? I'll quickly summarize what I would describe as the four best and most common ways companies can deploy excess cash:1. Reinvest in the company through R&D, CapEx, etc.Currently the company is spending upwards of $9M a year, or at least 18% of gross revenues, on R&D. This seems reasonable for a tech company who relies on staying at the front of the curve and indicates the company is already committed to investing heavily in R&D and CapEx.2. Pay down outstanding debtThe company has no debt, so this is not an option.3. Repurchase sharesShares are currently trading at 5x BV/share. (BV/share after goodwill @ 3/31 was $0.99)4. Declare and pay dividendsA Company cannot declare dividends with a deficit balance.A key point to take away is that the Company is currently limiting itself to its only remaining option for deploying cash, buybacks. They are already investing heavily into R&D and that will continue but the only other place they can deploy their cash is into buybacks right now, which appear to be very expensive. But if management had the option, would they really choose these expensive buybacks instead of paying a dividend? Currently a modest $0.14 dividend per share (2x EPS from 2014) would cost the company approx. $8M for the year. This would be a yield of 2-3% based on current prices and a payout ratio of 200%! I think investors would be pleased with that usage of capital as opposed to over-paying to acquire their own shares in the open market.In the end dividends may not be the answer right now either, but I would at least like to know there was a decision to be made instead of buybacks being the only thing the company can do."

        Zix's growth rate has slowed but shouldn't continue. Zix operates in a rapidly growing market, should be more aggressive on price, and should get more revenue contribution from partners.","Zix Corporation (NASDAQ:ZIXI) is a provider of email encryption and data loss prevention solutions. They operate in a rapidly growing market. Yet, Zix hasn't been able to take advantage of this growth. From 2009-2013, revenue grew at a CAGR of 16.2%. However, revenue growth has steadily declined over the last several years. In 2010, revenue grew 25.2% but in 2013 revenue only grew 11.0%. The company's revenue growth issues have continued into 2014. Revenue grew 6.5% in Q2 and 4.8% in the first half. The company's slowing revenue growth has impacted the stock. Zix's stock has declined 20.6% year to date. The stock also continues to struggle due to lower than expected future revenue. In Q2, management lowered full year revenue guidance. Revenue guidance is $51-$52 million down from $53-$55 million. Can Zix's management reverse the company's declining revenue growth?In 2014, management attributes their slow growth to weaker than expected indirect sales. Specially, Google's, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) lackluster sales generation was one of the reasons for the company's slow growth. Google's weak sales generation can be attributed to a transition to Zix's new solution. Zix recently released Google apps message encryption or GAME which is an encryption solution specially designed for Google applications. Yet, Google is nearing the end of sales training and should start to deliver better results over the next few quarters. Although Google's subpar sales execution was an issue, it isn't the company's only problem. They are in a very competitive market and are losing ground to competitors. Top competitors are significantly outpacing Zix's growth rate. In order to keep pace, Zix will have to be more aggressive on pricing. Fortunately, Zix has a very high gross margin which gives management the ability to be more aggressive.Zix needs and should be able to accelerate revenue growth. Revenue growth will be aided by Google and the exit of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). Additionally, management can be more aggressive on pricing due to their current margin position. Lastly, the market's double digit growth is expected to continue. TechNavio estimates the global email encryption market will grow at a CAGR of 21.05% until 2018.Cisco's Exit And Google's Sales ExecutionIn July 2012, Cisco announced the end of their IronPort encryption solution. The announcement has naturally resulted in Cisco's customers leaving to other encryption vendors. Yet, there are still many IronPort customers left. This is because Cisco's IronPort customers are still going to receive maintenance releases until July 2015. Customers have less than a year left before they will have to migrate over to a new provider. This presents a great opportunity for Zix to acquire several enterprise customers. On the Q2 conference call, Rick Spurr discussed the Cisco opportunity ""so we believe without substantiation that the total number of these large clients that have this IronPort Encryption Appliance installed are between 100 and 200 very large customers."" The acquisition of a few enterprise customers would meaningfully accelerate revenue growth. Fortunately, the company's sales team has been doing a good job of acquiring large customers. On the Q2 conference call, Rick Spurr talked about enterprise data loss prevent sales ""we signed 13 new DLP customers...Nearly all of these new seats were within enterprise accounts."" Zix's enterprise sales team is vital to taking advantage of the exodus from Cisco. Cisco's exit from the encryption market still represents a significant near term growth opportunity. Yet, Zix will need the help of Google in order to sustain their revenue growth. Especially since, Google's lackluster sales generation has significantly impacted Zix's revenue growth.In Q2, management partially attributes the company's slow growth to subpar sales from Google. On the Q2 conference call, Rick Spurr talked about OEM business ""Our OEM business had a weak quarter as expected. Primarily, reflecting what we believe should be the end of the slowdown from our product transition with Google."" In May 2014, Zix released a new encryption solution specially designed for Google apps. Currently, Google's sales team is finishing training. On the Q2 conference call, Rick Spurr talked about Google's sales progress ""Google will introduce GAME to their direct sales team when the product was announced in May. We are now in midst of more in depth training. We are also in the process of getting Google's resellers reengaged...the training of the reseller channel takes a little longer"" Google's sales team should start to drive revenue growth over the next few quarters. Especially since, Google apps represents a significant market share. Bitglass surveyed 81,253 organizations and discovered Google apps was used by 16.3% of survey participants. Additionally, Google apps is tied with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with an 8.8% market share of enterprise organizations. Google apps' current market share should help GAME quickly contribute to revenue growth. Zix has a great opportunity to accelerate revenue growth. The end of life for Cisco's IronPort will continue to be a catalyst for growth while GAME should start to meaningfully contribute to growth over the next several quarters. Yet, Zix operates in a competitive market which requires being aggressive on pricing. Fortunately, Zix's gross margin is well above the industry average and some margin compression won't significant impact the company.Some Margin Compression Will Help Spur GrowthZix's products have the ability to compete against top vendors like Microsoft. On the Q2 conference call, Rick Spurr talked about the competitive environment ""...in the first half of 2014, the total number of license seats that we won from the competition was 4.5 times greater than the number of seats won in the first half of last year. This significant ramp up is due largely to the enterprise team success with competitive replacements in large accounts this half, most notably one against Microsoft with a large healthcare system..."" Yet in order to accelerate revenue growth, management will need to lower prices. Despite lackluster OEM sales generation in 2014, the company's slowing growth can also be attributed to high prices. Over the last several years, revenue growth has slowed but Zix has maintained a very high gross margin. Management's reluctance to sacrifice gross margin has hurt revenue growth. Yet, this appears to be changing.Zix's gross margin is significantly higher than the industry average. On a trailing twelve month basis, Reuters estimates the industry's average gross margin was 57.4% which is much lower than Zix's gross margin of 84.1%. Zix has a high gross margin but is growing significantly slower than the industry and top competitors. Reuters estimates the industry's average growth rate was 17.5% in Q2 but Zix's revenue growth rate was only 6.6%. Additionally, Zix's growth rate was much slower than top competitor Proofpoint, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFPT). Proofpoint also sells email encryption and data loss prevention solutions to enterprise customers. In 2014, Proofpoint's revenue grew 45.8% in Q2 and 42.4% in the first half. Proofpoint was able to significantly exceed Zix's growth rate without sacrificing an unreasonable amount of margin. In Q2, Proofpoint's gross margin was 67.1%. Zix can't continue to fall behind competitors. Management will need to sacrifice some gross margin in order to keep pace. Zix's gross margin is very high and could fall several percentage points without significantly impacting the company. Fortunately in 2014, management has shown an increased willingness to sacrifice margin in order to grow and gain market share.Management has been aggressively pricing ZixOne (mobile encryption solution). On the Q1 conference call, Rick Spurr talked about ZixOne ""The average price per user per year looking at all ZixOne customers at the end of the quarter was $51..."" In Q2, ZixOne's average price per user per year was $40 and management expects it to eventually reach $21 per year. Management is trying to gain significant market share which is the reason for the aggressive pricing. On the Q1 conference call, Rick Spurr talked about pricing ""We intend to establish a meaningful market share and so as competitive prices come down we have brought our prices down accordingly. As a result, we now think that over the long-term our average price per user per year is likely to be around $21, the same as our email encryption business."" Additionally, management is being more aggressive in order to keep and acquire enterprise customers. On the Q2 conference call, Rick Spurr talked about lower average prices ""This lower than expected average seat price reflects two things number one, the preponderance of large enterprise deals and number two, one specific deal that makes up about half of these new seats, where for strategic reasons we sold at a below market price..."" As Zix adds more enterprise customers, gross margin should start to compress. Yet, Zix's high gross margin allows for plenty of compression before reaching the industry average. Google and Cisco will help growth but management will need to continue to be aggressive on pricing. A high gross margin is good but isn't helpful if revenue starts to decline.Growth NeededZix operates in a rapidly growing market. The market is expected to continue to grow double digits. Yet despite operating in a rapidly growing market, Zix's revenue growth has slowed over the last several years. In 2014, management attributes the company's slow growth to lackluster sales generation from Google. Zix recently released their new encryption solution for Google called GAME. The transition has resulted in lower current sales. Yet, the company's future growth prospects look much better. Google is nearing the end of training and should start to generate significant revenue over the next several quarters. Additionally, Cisco's exit from the encryption market should continue to be a catalyst for revenue growth. Customers still have several months before having to switch to a new vendor. This will be a great opportunity for Zix to acquire several large enterprise customers. Especially since, Zix's sales team has done a good job acquiring enterprise customers. Cisco's exit and Google's sales ramp up should help drive revenue growth. However, management still needs to be more aggressive on pricing.A high gross margin is good but only if revenue growth doesn't significantly slow. Zix's revenue growth has slowed while gross margin has remained high. The company has a higher gross margin than the industry and top competitors. Yet, their competitors are growing much faster and gaining significant market share. In order to keep pace, management will have to sacrifice some margin to grow faster. In 2014, management appears to be more willing to sacrifice margin in order to gain market share and grow. They have been aggressively pricing ZixOne in order to gain market share in the mobile market. Additionally, several large enterprise deals were closed below market prices in order to keep and acquire new customers. These activities show management's willingness to sacrifice margin in order to accelerate growth. Management will have to continue to be aggressive or risk falling further behind. Ultimately, management should be able to accelerate revenue growth. The encryption market is growing double digits. They can and are being more aggressive on price. Lastly, Google and Cisco will help boost revenue growth."

1976401,45951,2014-01-30T11:05:08-05:00,,"A few months ago, I wrote an article about Zix (NASDAQ:ZIXI), which introduced the company and the BYOD opportunity. Now I'm going to make an update on new products, and focus on valuation and growth opportunities.The company is the leader in email encryption and has launched two new products last year; ZixDLP (May 2013) and ZixOne (September 2013), the most promising product for the future of the company. ZixDLP is a cost effective solution, which can remove the risk of data loss. ZixOne is a BYOD mobile email application, which secures email on personal devices used for work.As I stated in my previous article, BYOD will become important for companies in the future:Update on new productsAccording to the last Earning Call Transcript, ZixDLP now has 23 customers with a number of license seats of 8,000. The company mentions that 75% of sales came from existing customers. It is relatively small when you compare it to the email encryption business, but this solution is relatively new. It will be interesting to follow the trend of new license seats in the future.Regarding ZixOne, the company stated to have 11 customers and 19 others are currently testing the service. 10 out of 11 are three year contracts and the average number of license seats is 60. Currently, companies are testing the service on small groups of employees before bringing the service to more people. The company expects to bundle the service with its existing product, email encryption. According to the CEO, ZixOne will be priced on average between $30 and $35 per user per year, depending on the contract size.The Ponemon Institute made a survey for the company, in order to know if customers will want to buy a Zix solution for BYOD challenge. The respondents were small to big companies. The CEO said:Analysis of ZixOne opportunity in terms of revenuesCurrently, email encryption product represents 100% of total revenues. The business is still growing by more than 10% year over year, which translates in a higher net profit year over year, and a nice amount of cash generated. But the big money is not in the email encryption for the future; it will come from ZixOne product, which will become the most important element in the company's strategy for the foreseeable future. As I said, more companies will face the BYOD challenge and will need a solution to address this potential threat. I do believe ZixOne, which is easy to use (literally you just have to download the app and then use your device as usual), provides a secure solution to protect the sensitive information on employees' personal devices. This is why ZixOne is going to be well received by companies in general. Moreover, the CEO appears very confident in the future potential of the new product.Now, let me go through the potential amount of future revenues generated by this product for the company.First of all, the company currently has 2.1 million paid end users with an average selling price of $21 per user per year (coming from Email Encryption business). If I assume that the business will grow by a 10% rate in the next five years, it will add 230,000 new users next year, 253,000 new users for the year 2015 and 278,000 new users for the year 2016 and so on (see the table below). According to the survey, 57% of respondents are currently interested in ZixOne solution for their BYOD needs. I assume the respondents were existing customers of Zix. As the CEO said, the BYOD product will be priced between $30 and $35 per user per year.In order to represent the potential increase in revenues for ZixOne product, I compute a table starting with the total paid end users of Email Encryption business (2.3 million). Afterwards, I take the lowest forecast in terms of price, $30 for the new solution, and I apply a varying conversion rate of Email Encryption ""EE"" product customers to ZixOne product, from 20% to 60% of existing customers. My highest hypothesis of conversion rate, 60% of existing customers, is driven by the fact that 57% of existing customers have an interest in the new solution. I didn't take higher conversion rate hypothesis to not overestimate the potential.For my DCF hypothesis, I assume that the company achieve a 20% of conversion rate of existing customers for ZixOne product for next year, which is very conservative regarding the actual interest of customers from the Ponemon survey. Afterwards, I assume 30% for the year 2015, 40% for the year 2016, 50% for the year 2017 and 60% for the year 2018. These estimates are very conservative because 57% of respondents of the survey are interested by the product right now and I doubt that it will take five years to see 60% of existing customers using ZixOne for BYOD needs. But it is better to be well surprised than disappointed. Therefore, I use the blue boxes to do my DCF computation i.e. :The company currently has backlog orders of $64.2 million and expects $34.66 million (54% of total backlog) to be recognized in revenues for the year 2014, which exclusively come from Email Encryption business. An interesting thing is that Email Encryption customers have a very high renewal rate; 90% of them renews their contracts year over year. And a majority of them have a three years contract, which translates a strong business model and highly forseeable revenues for the future.We can estimate that the same renewal rate will apply for the new product. In fact, BYOD market will continue to grow and will be the norm for the future. The second point is the ease of use and quality build of the product, which will attract more companies to Zix solutions. Therefore, the revenues are likely to increase in the future.ValuationAs I previously said, the company currently has approximately 9,000 corporate customers with 2.3 million paid end users with an average selling price of $21 per user per year. It will generated $48.3 million revenues for the year 2013 ($21 x 2.3 million users), which is in accordance with the company's guidance of generated revenues between $48 and $50 million.Note that the business is well diversified because the weight of the largest customer accounts for only 2% of total revenues. The company doesn't rely on big customers, which is a good thing for margins.The company expects an adjusted EBIT margin of 25% for the year 2014.I assume an EBIT margin of 25% for the year 2015. Afterwards, I use an EBIT margin of 22% for the following years, due to the fact that the business will grow at an impressive rate, which will impact negatively the margins.Finally, I assume the company will pay no taxes on operating income until 2016. As you can see in the last AR, the company paid no taxes in 2012, 2011 and 2010. For the year 2017 and beyond, I assume a tax rate of 10%.I assume a WACC of 7.33% based on Damodaran research and data from last ER. I assume an infinity growth rate of 2%.To improve the quality of this analysis, I built a matrix to understand how the firm value per share is affected by changing the WACC and the future EBIT margin (2016 to 2019).When I apply this valuation model to Zix, I get a fair value per share of $5.46, which represents a potential upside of 20%, based on a price per share of $4.55.The MDM RiskCompanies which cares about mobile security, have two options to deal with. They can choose solutions as Zix offers, or opt for MDM (Mobile Device Management) solutions, which are provided by companies such as BlackBerry (BBRY), Good Technology and AirWatch. The risk is that companies which have to deal with BYOD, move to a MDM solution because they believe it is more secure, because the service will secure the whole device (calendar, navigator, email) and offers more flexibility than Zix solutions (work/personal uses), due to the fact that each company has its own server. In comparison, Zix uses the same server for all its customers.If you go to the BlackBerry Business site, you will see that the solution comparable to ZixOne is currently priced $19 per year per device (BlackBerry, iOS or Android devices), which is less than Zix price for their service. Nevertheless, Zix solutions are easier to use and implement. Therefore, the company still has an advantage on this point.ConclusionAccording to the FCF valuation model, the company is undervalued by 20%, which shows that it's an opportunity to invest in right now, in order to take advantage of this market mispricing. Note that I took conservative hypothesis so it could have more upside. The company has a treasury of $32.876 million, which represents a Price-to-cash ratio around 8.5.The company is currently the leader in email encryption. The future success of the company will heavily rely on the ZixOne service, indeed the company has to successfully implement the service through its existing customers to increase its revenues. I do believe the company is well positioned to benefit from the BYOD market for mobile security.Additional Disclosure: This analysis is based on current market conditions which include a positive U.S. GDP growth for the upcoming years, and a non-deteriorating situation in the Eurozone. The analysis also assume a successful traction among existing customers for ZixOne product.Disclosure: I am long BBRY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: I may initiate a long position in ZIXI at any time"
1499822,34381,2013-06-13T11:21:09-04:00,,"Back in January, I published a brief article profiling Zix Corporation (NASDAQ:ZIXI). At the time, my primary thesis was based on several firm-specific catalysts and ZIXI's favorable valuation metrics. Overall, I initiated a buy recommendation at $3 per share and concluded that investors consider the potential growth ZIXI has to offer. Let's take a look at how ZIXI performed YTD:Over the last five months, its security price has increased nearly 33%. It recently established a 52-week high at $4.20 and is now trading below that right around $4 per share. With 61.87 mm shares outstanding, its market capitalization is roughly $250.04 mm. Overall, ZIXI has experienced positive long-term growth in its earnings per share over the past five years. Given it's a small capitalization company, there is plenty of growth options available for ZIXI to continue expanding its operations. Therefore, investors should expect this growth to continue in the long-run. Analysts estimates remain favorable with an earnings per share estimate suggesting roughly 26% growth just within the next year. It's now time to determine whether investors should realize short-term profits or continue to hold for further upside. For starters, let's revisit ZIXI's business model.The BusinessThe primary focus of ZIXI's business is centered around designing as well as implementing high quality security for different means of electronic communication. As mentioned in my previous article, its business can easily be analyzed by dividing it between two segments, including its email encryption services and its e-Prescribing service. It's important to note ZIXI's services are highly specialized and distinctively different from those provided by its competitors. I will address the importance of these two factors shortly. First, let's understand why these services are unique.#1 ZixCorp® Email Encryption Service's are designed for regulatory compliance and for protecting sensitive communication for clients. ZIXI's management states, ""No competing solution can offer these fundamental components."" The fundamental components of its Email Encryption system include:#2 ZixDLP™ Email Data Loss Prevention services comprise the e-Prescribing segment of its business. This service is unique because it provides clients with real-time access to critical information on demand, which aids in enhancing electronic transmission of prescriptions directly to pharmacies. In addition, this service provides clients with a tool to mitigate risk by monitoring and measuring efficiency. Additionally, customers are attracted to this service for its cost advantages. In addition to the positive results it provides clients, many clients view it as a highly cost-effective approach for managing business risk.As you can see, ZIXI's business models hrive off its ability to effectively address its clients needs. Its services incorporate a high degree of specialization and its service offering is distinctively different than its competitors. For this market in particular, the barriers to entry are moderately high, which is reflected by relatively few competing firms within the industry. The combination of these factors suggest ZIXI operates in a monopolistic competitive market. The fundamental characteristics of this market are highly advantageous for firms who wish to exert a large degree of pricing power. And given the high level of differentiation achieved from ZIXI's specialized services, ZIXI is perfectly positioned to utilize pricing power to its advantage. In the long run, control over pricing power will allow room for margin expansion, help maintain an adequate level of solvency to fund capital expenditures, and ultimately it will increase its market share allowing it to sustain a solid position within the industry.Operating PerformanceOver the last five year, ZIXI has produced stable increases in its revenue year over year. However, based on the changes in net income, it is evident ZIXI has experienced issues with earnings variability in the past. The variation in its net income can be attribute to changes in the pricing structure of its services and additional capital expenditures to expand its operations. Going forward, management anticipates these factors will have less of an influence as ZIXI focuses on its cost structure and adjusting its pricing policy for services.ZIXI Revenue TTM data by YChartsClearly, ZIXI's unique service offering is sufficient for sustaining its operations as a firm. But in order to ensure its margins are substantial enough to maintain an adequate level of solvency and increase the firm's intrinsic value, we must take a look at its ability to generate cash flow. While looking at revenue and net income is important, analyzing cash flow from operations allows us to distinguish whether a firm is generating real earnings or using accounting gimmicks to distort net income. Let's take a look:ZIXI Cash from Operations TTM data by YChartsAbove, you will see ZIXI's cash flows have increased tremendously within the last five years. Its operating cash flow is strong, which indicates the company is producing solid earnings for investors. Additionally, this is expressed through the relatively comparably high level of free cash flow to the firm. One more thing I would like to point out is that, historically, ZIXI has maintained a strong level of cash on its balance sheet. The current cash on its balance sheet of $24.21 mm is roughly 10% of its total market capitalization, which equates to slightly less than $0.50 per share. Overall, ZIXI's profitability is superb for a company in its growth stage. In the future, as ZIXI establishes a solid pricing policy that utilizes the pricing power generated from its market structure, its real earnings produced from operations have the potential to be stronger than ever.What Should You Expect NextEven with steady appreciation in its security price from YTD, its technicals continue to support further growth. Its 30-day relative strength index (RSI) indication does not suggest the stock has been over bought. In the short-run, this is positive for investors because it suggests there is not a high probability of a downward trend in its security price. In addition, analysts remain optimistic. Currently, the six analysts that cover the stock have a median price target of $5.75 per share. While this implies a high upside of nearly 44%, this price per share would not stretch ZIXI's valuation beyond reason. Overall, ZIXI is a company in its growth stage. A highly specialized product exhibiting a strong demand is precisely what is needed for ZIXI to make the transition from operating in a growth stage to sustaining its operations in a mature market. Patient investors have a high probability of being rewarded with abnormal returns as ZIXI continues to grow as a company.Sources: Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, TD Ameritrade, sec.gov, Zix Corporation's Company Website, Bloomberg Market Data, and YCharts.Disclosure: I am long ZIXI.

1515602,45951,2013-06-21T17:37:20-04:00,,"The aim of this article is to introduce ZixCorp (NASDAQ:ZIXI), a small-cap company involved in email security. After a brief business overview of the company, I'm going to discuss its financial statements with some interesting key findings. The company defines itself as a leader in email data protection. ZixCorp offers three main solutions, which are email encryption, email data loss protection (ZixDLP) and email BYOD( ZixOne) to meet the company's data protection. The company does its business primarily with large companies operating in healthcare, finance and insurance, and with governments, for which security is a priority for data.First of all, let's have a quick look at the three solutions developed by the company in order to understand what they are and why they are complementary.Email Encryption ServiceAccording to the 2012 annual report, Email Encryption is:""a comprehensive secure messaging service, which allows an enterprise to use policy-driven rules to determine which email messages should be sent securely to comply with regulations or company-defined policies. (…) ZixCorp's main differentiation in the marketplace is our exceptional ease of use. The best example of this is our ability to provide transparent delivery of secure, encrypted email. Most email encryption solutions are focused on the sender. They typically introduce an added burden on receivers, often requiring additional user authentication with creation of a new user identity and password. We designed our solution to alleviate the receiver's burden by enabling the delivery of encrypted email automatically and transparently. ZixCorp enables transparent delivery by (1)ZixDirectory, the world's largest email encryption community which is designed to share identities, (2) ZixCorp's Best Method of Delivery™, which is designed to deliver email according to the sender's encryption policy, and (3) ZixGateway, which is an enterprise gateway that automatically decrypts the message. The result is secure encrypted email exchange that is transparent for both sender and receiver.""ZixCorp's Email Encryption service is unique thanks to the combination of a community approach with a software-as-a-service architecture. This structure allows to implement an easy-to-use approach for email encryption. As the company stated, email encryption is only effective if it's used, and it's only used if it's easy.Email Data Loss Prevention (DLP): ZixDLP solutionThis solution was launched in March 2013. According to the last quarterly earnings:""ZixDLP addresses business' greatest source of data loss - email. By focusing strictly on email, ZixCorp provides a straightforward DLP approach that decreases the cost, reduces deployment time from months to hours and minimizes impact on customer resources and workflow.""Email DLP is a cost-effective solution which can remove the risk of data loss. This solution is built on the same principle than/as the Email Encryption solution: simplicity of use.Email Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD): ZixOne solutionAccording to the company's website, ZixOne is:""a mobile app that simplifies the BYOD challenge by enabling easy access to the most used business application on mobile devices - email. Of all activities performed on mobile devices, email still remains the most popular - at 79 percent for smartphones and 72 percent for tablets. By focusing on a business' greatest exposure, ZixOne provides the ultimate BYOD solution - uncompromised benefits for both companies and employees - with a simple per user price.""CompetitionThe company competes with Axway (a France-based company), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Echoworx, McAfee (owned by Intel), Symantec (SYMC), Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT), Trend Micro and Voltage Security.Business Solutions: OverviewRight now, email encryption is the main business of the company and represents almost 100% of total sales. The company has more than 8,700 corporate customers (companies) with 1.9 million paid end users at an average of $23 per user per year. The revenues of the company are well diversified, the largest customer representing less than 2 percent of total revenues. They also have backlog orders of approximately $60 million, which are not yet reflected in current sales. According to a research of the Ponemon Institute in 2012, the company is currently the leader of email encryption service.The two other services, email data loss protection and email BYOD, were recently launched in the market (March 2013 and May 2013, respectively). They can be seen as ""add-ons"" to the main solution, which is email encryption. In fact, Email DLP and BYOD services are complementary to email encryption, because encrypted emails need to be protected on every device used by employees. By bringing to the market email BYOD, ZixCorp solves the other gap of email security faced by companies. Data loss also constitutes a disadvantage for companies, which has to be addressed in order to be more efficient in decisions taken. Moreover, the business risk can be reduced. ZixCorp focuses on email and security so the three solutions are well-integrated within its business and offer interesting growth opportunities in the future.Why will Email BYOD solution become so important for companies in the future?BYOD, which permits employees to work with their own devices, becomes an increasing challenge for companies because this phenomenon is still increasing: employees like to use their own devices when they are working. Nevertheless, the devices can experience security threats (steal of sensitive corporate data on unsecured personal devices, for example).Security remains a key component in almost every business. In May 2013, ZixCorp released ZixOne to address this threat. According to the company, it's the first bring-your-own-device (BYOD) mobile email app, which solves the problems faced by companies, which must secure corporate data on employee personal devices. The company targets mainly iOS and Android devices because they are the two most widespread mobile operating systems in the market.By protecting corporate data in email, employees can use their email address without the fear of being spied. The main contribution of the mobile app developed by ZixCorp is to bring a solution of ""non-storage"" for emails on personal devices, where it has greater potential for compromise. Moreover, as the company stated, if the device is lost or stolen, ZixOne can disable access to corporate email from that device.The BYOD app is currently in beta testing and will be released on September 2013 for commercial use. Nigel Johnson, Vice President of Business Development and Product Management, said:""Our beta customers have given us the same response across the board - We're glad Zix is tackling the BYOD problem. The beta version has received only positive reviews so far. We look forward to releasing the commercial version and becoming a key player in the BYOD marketplace.""Financials and future opportunitiesZixCorp's financial situation is very strong. As you can see, revenues have been increasing significantly for the last 5 years. More importantly, the financial crisis seems to not have existed for the company. In 2013, the company expects to generate revenues between $48 and $50 million, which represents an increase of 15% from previous year.The gross margin is still very high and stays at a rate higher than 80% of revenues, which can be seen as a strong competitive advantage. This advantage is also reinforced by the fact that the company is the leader in email encryption.The cash flow from operations and operating margin will be lower this year than the last two years due to the fact that the company has invested more in R&D and marketing in order to develop its two new solutions. As a result, the operating margin will be lower this year but will start to improve by the end of the year and in 2014, thanks to the new solutions delivered to existing customers. In fact, the company said the email BYOD is currently in beta testing and is well-received by existing customers.The cash position of the company is also very strong with cash and equivalents of $24.208 million and the company has only $1 million of long-term liabilities.For the next few years, email BYOD and email DLP will sustain the growth of the company because these new solutions have already been well-received by existing customers, as the company said. Therefore, it is only a matter of time to see these solutions implemented.Let's make a quick evaluation of potential impact on revenues for the two new solutions. The company has currently 1.9 million paid end users at an average of $23 per user per year. If Email DLP service is priced at $5 per user and Email BYOD solution at $10, it can easily double revenues in the 2-3 next years. Moreover, BYOD phenomenon is increasing year over year, this is why BYOD will constitute an important market space for the company's future.ValuationTwo weeks ago, Michael Kim, Imperial Capital analyst, started the company coverage with an outperform rating and $5.50 price target, which represents a potential upside of 40% based on a share price of $3.93. In the report, the analyst said:""We believe ZIXI is a top-tier email encryption service provider and is strongly positioned to capitalize on expanding adoption by organizations seeking to protect their email communications due to security concerns and compliance requirements. ZIXI possesses an established base of more than 8,700 corporate customers, with significant penetration in the healthcare, financial and government verticals. We believe the company's third-party channel expansion could drive broader market reach. We believe ZIXI's multi-year subscription model offers attractive financial visibility - we anticipate continued strong growth in paid end-users and stable pricing, bolstered by 90% contract renewal rates. Near-term revenue is supported by a sizeable backlog. We see potential upside from ZIXI's recently introduced and upcoming products, which could offer significant cross-selling opportunities and new customer wins. We look for increasing sales contribution from e-mail data loss prevention and mobile data security.""ConclusionZixCorp is a strong company when you look at its financial position: leader in email encryption, gross margin higher than 80%, cash of $24 million and only $1 million of long term debts. Moreover, the company will benefit from growth opportunities in the BYOD market area. With a potential upside of 40%, ZixCorp is definitively a stock to have in your portfolio. The risk is low because the email encryption business has high barriers to entry.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ZIXI over the next 72 hours.

2162043,45951,2014-04-25T14:30:10-04:00,New products aren't as well received as previously expected.The CEO's overconfidence led to the current sell-off.Zix is now overvalued based on the new information given by the CEO.,"Two days ago, Zix (NASDAQ:ZIXI) reported its quarterly earnings. The market didn't like it, perhaps focusing on poor guidance regarding the anticipated ZixOne, which leads to a postponing of higher revenue growth. As a result, the share price tumbled 10%.In my last article, I made assumptions regarding the potential of the ZixOne product, based on CEO Rick Spurr's commentary. Nevertheless, nothing positive came from that product, according to the last conference call. In fact, ZixOne is not as well received as the traditional email encryption solution. In this article, I'm going to demonstrate that the CEO was overconfident about ZixOne as well as make my own assumptions about the share price based on sales of ZixOne in the future.ZixOne on iOS and AndroidFirst, I had a look at the Google Play and iTunes store to try to determine how is the product received by the customers.ZixOne's last update was on April 7th. Currently, there are between 1,000 and 5,000 downloads. We can assume the same for iTunes, which doesn't provide any information regarding the number of downloads. Therefore, ZixOne has been downloaded a little 10,000 times at best. This is totally worthless when you compare it to the million users of email encryption solutions.At first glance, the new product is currently taking off very slowly, which is not encouraging for future sales.CEO over confidenceNow, I'm going to quote the CEO's ""overconfidence"" from last conference calls. I believed in the CEO's previous remarks, but it was a big mistake, because the solution wasn't as well received as he expected. The CEO blames higher competition and slower adoption rate for new products. As a result, my previous analysis is totally flawed.Fortunately, I was waiting for the earning release before investing in the company. I wanted to have a clearer picture of the adoption rate and revenues generated from new products. At the least, I expected positive guidance regarding ZixOne for this year. But the CEO came with a totally different message. He was overconfident and now, shareholders pay the price of this overconfidence.In Q4 2013, the CEO said:As of today, we have learned that ZixOne and ZixDLP won't contribute to the 2014 results as previously expected. In fact, the guidance on revenues ($53 to $55 million) includes sales from the existing email encryption business, and no meaningful contribution from ZixOne or ZixDLP are expected for next year. However the company introduced ZixOne in September 2013. Therefore, the product has been on the market for 7 months and still doesn't generate any revenues. But the CEO was very confident about its future success in the Q3 2013 conference call, when he said:57% was a great response for a newly implemented solution in the market. But in 7 months of availability, only 10,000 people effectively downloaded the solution. Moreover, the CEO expected a higher pricing than the existing email encryption business, ranging from $30 to $35. He also said the price was below that of competition. Nevertheless, in the last conference call (Q1 2014) he said:Now, the company blamed higher competition for its solution. As a result, ZixOne will be pricing at $21 as the email encryption solution. ZixOne's pricing decreases by 30% (from $30 to $21) in one single quarter due to higher competition. However, the CEO said in Q3 2013 (emphasis mine):The company was totally wrong on new solution pricing and the interest from existing customers. This has led to the sell-off from yesterday. The market no longer believes the company's story about the new products. In my opinion, it takes too much time to effectively generate revenues on new products despite the company's previous confidence.Update on ZixOne revenue assumptionsWhile I was optimistic about ZixOne sales in the future, I'm currently very disappointed with the guidance given by the CEO for the year 2014, because the guidance only includes sales from existing products.Previously, I assumed around $15 million in revenues coming from ZixOne for the current year. Now, I won't expect any new revenues for 2014 because if the new product was as well received as the company pretended, it would already have materialized in meaningful additional revenues. At the moment, the CEO still says that they are making marketing investments to develop the future sales of ZixOne and ZixDLP. In the Q4 2013 conference call, the CEO said that the company was already massively investing in marketing and that they had 216 active VARs (Value added resellers). 6 months later, there are still no revenues generated from ZixOne, despite the supposed great early interest from customers.ZixOne future revenues were the main component of my previous analysis. To assess the company's share price, I based my assumptions on the CEO's words; ZixOne pricing between $30 to $35 per year per user; and increased adoption rate from existing customers. My revenues assumptions weren't optimistic, they were conservative. As a result, my analysis and valuation are now completely obsolete.My previous assumptions regarding the existing email encryption solution are still valid. Regarding the ZixOne solution, I still estimate the revenues according to the Ponemon survey but I change the pricing because as the CEO said, ZixOne will be priced $21 per user per year as the email encryption solution. This is a decrease of 30% in one single quarter, which is a very bad news because it demonstrates the fact that the company has totally misunderstood the pricing of the new solution as well as the competitive offerings. As a result, the good news coming from the release of a new promising product (ZixOne) has transformed into very bad news due to the overconfidence from the CEO. He was too optimistic in his own expectations.As I previously said, in order to represent the potential increase in revenues for ZixOne product, I compute a table starting with the total paid end users of Email Encryption business (2.3 million). Afterwards, I use the $21 price for the new solution, and I apply a varying conversion rate of Email Encryption ""EE"" product customers to ZixOne product, from 10% to 50% of existing customers (more conservative than before, i.e. 20% to 60%, to point out the soft guidance on the new products). I didn't use a higher conversion rate hypothesis to avoid overestimating the potential.ValuationAs I previously wrote, the company currently has approximately 2.3 million paid end users with an average selling price of $21 per user per year. For the following year, the company gives a guidance between $53 million to $55 million, which won't include any meaningful new revenues from new products.In the last conference call, the CEO said that he will increase marketing efforts behind the new products, so I decided to decrease the previous EBIT margin to take that into account. As a result, I assume a decreased EBIT margin year over year with stabilization in the year 2018 and 2019 at 20%. Because new products are less well received than expected, the company will have to spent more dollars on expenses to improve its future sales.Other assumptions:To improve the quality of this analysis, I built a matrix to understand how the firm value per share is affected by changing the WACC and the future EBIT margin (2018 - 2019). Although the company is financially sound with a lot of cash and no meaningful debt, Zix is currently overvalued based on my new assumptions, which are fairly conservative. When I apply this valuation model to Zix, I get a fair value per share of $3.07, which represents a potential downside of 11%, based on a price per share of $3.47.ConclusionWhile ZixOne's prospects from previous quarters appeared very promising for the current year, the market has finally realized that the story is totally different. ZixOne was not as well received as previously said, because no meaningful revenues were directly generated from new products. Moreover, the company doesn't expect any contribution from new products for the current year. As a reminder, ZixOne was released September 3, 2013.I do believe the market (and I) were misled by the CEO's overconfidence in the new solutions, as I pointed out with comments from previous conference calls. This led unavoidably to the current sell-off in the share price.Based on the new data available, I would recommend avoiding the stock at the moment and take a wait and see approach. There is enough room for more downside. Moreover, any bad news regarding the new products will lead to a further decrease in the share price. Before investing in the company, I will wait for some positive signs of a real take off from ZixOne solution in the market, because the company's value is highly correlated to the future success of this new product.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

This article provides a brief overview to ZIXI's business model, highlights its current performance as well as valuation metrics, and concludes with four reasons why ZIXI is a speculative buy at its current market value per share.ZIXI's operations and service offering entities are supported by ZixData Center, which is a network operations center focused on electronic transaction processing. ZIXI's email encryption service serves the purpose of two key functions:One, it enables the use of email for information exchange primarily in the healthcare, financial services, insurance, and government sectors. Co.'s Email Encryption Service is a messaging service, which allows an enterprise to use policy-driven rules to determine which emails should be sent to comply with regulations or company-defined policies. Co. enables delivery by ZixDirectory, which is designed to share identities, Zix's Best Method of Delivery, which is designed to deliver email according to the sender's encryption policy and ZixGateway, which is an enterprise gateway that automatically decrypts the message.Two, it enables a user to send encrypted email to any email user at any email address by using the ZixCorp Best Method of Delivery protocol, which determines the appropriate means of delivery based on the sender's and recipient's communications environment and preferences. The protocol supports a number of encrypted email delivery mechanisms, including S/MIME, TLS, OpenPGP, push delivery, and secure portal pull delivery. These last two mechanisms enable users to send messages securely to anyone with an email address, including those who do not have an encryption tool.As I have illustrated below, you will see ZIXI is currently trading right above $3 per share. Taking into account its price to free cash flow and PEG ratio are 13.84 and 0.44, respectively, it is fair to say ZIXI is trading at a deep discount to fair valuation.Figure 1: ZIXI's Five-Year Price GraphClick to enlarge image.Here are four reasons why ZIXI is a speculative buy at only $3 per share:In conclusion, basic valuation metrics suggest ZIXI is trading at a nice discount to fair value. With the combination of increasing profit margins, strong sales growth, and positive outlook from analysts, ZIXI is now an attractive play for FY 2013 and has the potential to provide investors with substantial upside.Sources: Bloomberg Market Data, TD Ameritrade, Google Finance, and Yahoo Finance.Disclosure: I am long ZIXI.

Consider the situation at Zix Corp (NASDAQ:ZIXI). The Dallas-based company has a small but growing business selling email encryption. In mid-2003, Zix moved into electronic prescriptions through its $1.5m acquisition of the assets of PocketScript. The plan was to expand its business of providing secure communications to the billions of prescriptions written every year in a less costly and more secure way.However, after nearly six years of trying to realize those goals, Zix has little to show for it. Revenue from the e-prescriptions unit totaled just $5.4m, or 19% of Zix’s overall sales, in 2008. Sales at the division last year slipped 11% from the year before, compared to a 26% increase in its core email encryption business. (And we would note that both units employed some 73 people, giving an idea of the relative returns of each unit.)Moreover, the e-prescriptions division has only one-third the number of subscribers that Zix estimates would be required to cover the costs of developing the service, according to the company’s own calculations. And now, Zix has acknowledged that it may never get the business to that level on its own. The firm hired Allen & Co late last week to advise it on ’strategic alternatives’ for its e-prescriptions unit."

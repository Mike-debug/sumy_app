        Strong billings growth of 55% y/y, not showing any deceleration at all, is no longer enough to satisfy the markets.
        While Zscaler has distinguished itself from many other growth SaaS stocks by generating positive EPS, it is still a long way from being valued on an earnings basis.
        Trading at just shy of 30x forward revenues, Zscaler remains one of the most expensive stocks in the SaaS sector.","Investors who have held onto Zscaler (ZS) so far have been very lucky: the security-as-a-service stock, a perennial investor favorite since its IPO at just $16 per share, have risen nearly 3x year to date, and at one point in late August before the September tech selloff those gains had even stretched to 4x. Zscaler's premise of ""rethinking digital security"" through its cloud-native tools has won the praise of many investors and industry analysts. Its flagship Zscaler Internet Access tool, which helps corporate employees access the internet and other internet-based applications through a secure network, has been well-positioned to take market share away from traditional network security providers like Palo Alto Networks (PANW). There's no question that security tools that are better aligned to the way we work now (through cloud applications) are vital - yet Zscaler's massive run has priced the stock for perfection.And that's why, despite strong fiscal fourth quarter results and an upbeat guidance for the FY21 that Zscaler just entered, the company was unable to sustain its year-to-date rally.My bearish view on Zscaler has only intensified after seeing the speed of the tech selloff in September. Investors should be well aware of the fact that even after a ~20% fall from peak values, Zscaler's over-pumped valuation could still see a meaningful correction and take away more of the stock's year-to-date gains.At present share prices near $130, Zscaler trades at a $16.77 billion market cap (we'll note here that this puts Zscaler among the most highly valued enterprise software stocks in the market, with a market cap that is roughly now equal to Slack's (WORK) and Citrix's (CTXS)). After netting off the $1.37 billion of cash and $0.86 billion of debt on Zscaler's most recent balance sheet, meanwhile, the company's enterprise value is $16.26 billion.Meanwhile, Zscaler has just issued its first pass at guidance for FY21 (the year that began this August for the company) that calls for $580-$590 million in revenue (34-37% y/y growth), substantially above the $557.0 million (+29% y/y) that Wall Street had called for. Figure 1. Zscaler guidance updateSource: Zscaler Q4 earnings releaseIn spite of that bigger-than-expected FY21 revenue range, however, Zscaler still now trades at an optimistic 27.8x EV/FY21 revenue. Needless to say that puts Zscaler among the highest-valued software stocks in the market, right up alongside names like Datadog (DDOG), Okta (OKTA), and Docusign (DOCU).We've seen from names like Alteryx (AYX) that the ""fall from grace"" from a huge valuation can be sharp and swift. In my view, the fact that Zscaler is expecting to decelerate to mid-30s growth next year (from high 40s growth this year) will act as a further impetus to drive its valuation multiple down.Be very careful of investing in Zscaler at peak values. Investors would be wise to position themselves out of Zscaler and into more value-oriented tech stocks (some names that are still fast growers that I like at the moment include Slack (WORK), Medallia (MDLA), and Elastic (ESTC) - all representing much better value than Zscaler). Let's now dig into Zscaler's latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q4 earnings summary is shown below:Figure 2. Zscaler Q4 and FY20 resultsSource: Zscaler Q4 earnings releaseZscaler's revenue of $125.9 million grew 47% y/y to $125.9 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $118.7 million (+38% y/y) by a wide nine-point margin. Perhaps more impressive than revenue, however, was the fact that Zscaler managed to grow billings in excess of revenue at 55% y/y, the same pace of growth as in Q1 (very difficult to do for a company at Zscaler's >$500 million annualized revenue scale).Figure 3. Zscaler billingsSource: Zscaler Q4 earnings releaseZscaler credited much of this top-line strength to its decision to invest in building out a broader sales organization - which is the top strategy in any enterprise software company's growth playbook. CEO Jay Chaudry noted some of the highlights of the company's sales force expansion on the Q4 earnings call:Yet we do feel that this top-line strength somewhat came at the expense of profitability - which is unfortunate, as I'd expect in a market selloff that investors will look to take shelter in companies that have more of a cash flow/earnings story backing them.Zscaler's gross margin, as can be seen in the chart below, fell three points on a pro forma basis to 78%. This may strike investors as somewhat odd, as most software companies find margins will gain leverage through greater scale. Yet Zscaler commented that because of a 10x surge in ZIA user traffic since February, the company has had to correspondingly surge its usage of cloud platforms like AWS (AMZN) and Azure (MSFT), which CFO Remo Canessa noted ""run at significantly higher costs compared to our data centers.""Figure 4. Zscaler gross margin trendsSource: Zscaler Q4 earnings releaseZscaler is also an odd man out in this earnings season for being one of the few enterprise software companies to see pro forma operating margins decline, down to positive 6% (a three-point reduction versus 9% in 4Q19). Many other companies have been able to utilize lower T&E costs as well as cancelled sales/customer events to drive tremendous growth in operating margins, but these cost tailwinds for Zscaler were more than completely offset by its gross margin headwinds and expanded sales force spend. Similarly, while Zscaler was still able to generate $27.5 million of free cash flow in FY20, its 6% margin fell four points short of the 10% FCF margin the company notched in FY19:Figure 5. Zscaler FCFSource: Zscaler Q4 earnings releaseTo me, a company trading as richly as Zscaler should have more to show for itself than strong growth. It's true that Zscaler's >50% y/y billings growth is impressive, but the company has failed to back that with meaningful improvements in profitability margins, which will be the key driver for Zscaler to sustain its rally and elevated valuation multiples. In my view, the Zscaler correction still has plenty further to go, as the company's ~28x forward revenue multiple (a far richer multiple of revenue than the S&P 500 is trading as a multiple of GAAP earnings) signals a stock priced for perfection.Tread cautiously here."

Work from home will slowly return to something like the old days, but Zscaler's services will in our view remain in tune with the zeitgeist.The value proposition offered by the company is simple. Your company needs computing devices to be able to connect from anywhere, across a network, to applications and microservices (that is, the underlying bits and pieces that form parts of applications) which are also likely to be hosted, well, anywhere. The promise of the Internet is that this is possible. The standardization of the enterprise network on TCP/IP, HTTPS and other related protocols makes it possible. The huge, sustained, and increasing degree of malevolence among unwelcome snoopers, hackers, thieves and other forms of ne'er-do-wells preying on the corporate network however - that mitigates against using the Internet as an any-to-any network for the enterprise. Companies solve for this using all manner of expensive private network partitions sold to them at great cost and delight by the likes of Verizon (VZ), AT&T (T) and others in the telco sector. Alternatively - indeed sometimes additionally - corporates will then buy great racks full of network security systems, from the likes of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and others. This stuff is expensive to buy, upgrade and maintain. For the most part, security itself has yet to make it into the cloud. Companies spend their time and money protecting their networks and traffic from the gremlins that lurk in the cloud. ZS operates to a different thesis. Its proposition is, let's assume you cannot trust anything in the cloud; let's say you can trust ZS; and let's say that if your devices and applications connect to the ZS network environment as the first hop to the cloud, the protection and cleansing service can be applied there. Which means no need to buy expensive private circuits from a telco or pay out lumps of capex to buy kit from hardware vendors. You remember this pitch, right? Salesforce.com (CRM) was making this pitch for application software in the late 1990s. Their byline at the time was, ""No Software"", meaning, ""No Installed Software"". (Their phone number at the time was 1-800-No-Software). It worked out pretty well for CRM and all the other cloud application software companies that followed. It's still working out pretty well.We cover two security software companies, being ZS and CrowdStrike (CRWD). There's a lot of companies around in this sector but the reason we like these names is the incredibly strong financial fundamentals both companies offer. (You can read our prior work on CRWD here).ZS put in an exceptionally strong quarter to the end of July - that's Q4 of their financial year FY7/20. Here's the numbers; a brief commentary follows.Source: Company SEC filings, YCharts.com, Cestrian AnalysisGreen, as you might surmise, shows the good parts. Here's our key takeaways:Now here's the part that caused us to go to Buy yesterday in our Marketplace subscription service. Deferred revenue growth. If you read our work here on SA you know we can bore you for a long time about deferred revenue growth. But this is why - it's a little glimpse into the future. Deferred revenue is pre-paid contracts; money that customers have given the vendor in order to deliver a service in the future. It shows up, confusingly, as a liability on the balance sheet - because having already received the money, the vendor has a liability to deliver services of that value to the customer. Most cloud companies have a high level of ""current deferred revenue"" vs. ""non-current deferred revenue"", in other words, a high level of prepaid contracts which will be recognized in the next twelve months, not much to be recognized in the next twelve months. That tells you they win prepayments on a one-year basis a lot of the time, and relatively few prepaid multiple years. We look closely at deferred revenue as a percentage of TTM recognized revenue. If deferred divided by TTM is say 1.0 (100%) - that tells you that the company has already been paid for, and is expected to deliver, 100% of last year's revenue next year. In other words, everything but the growth is in the bag already. Compare that to a normal business where every morning you wake up and think, hm, I wonder what we will sell today. At ZS or similar companies - CRWD is even stronger on this front - you get to work and say, ""OK, all of last year's revenue is already in the bag for next year. Now I can just focus on winning the new revenue"". That's both a relaxing place to work, and also likely to be a high growth place to work. Look at the deferred revenue above. It's now 86% of TTM revenue, and it's growing at 46% vs this time last year. In short: that's good. The stock barely moved on the earnings print yesterday, which we thought was odd given the growth acceleration. The guidance - for about 36% revenue growth in FY7/21 - looks light. One analyst on the earnings call asked how to reconcile that with the big new sales team hired by the company this year; the company answered, ""you know we like to be cautious on guidance"". So they could be wrong but when you factor in the recently increased sales costs, plus the acceleration in deferred growth (meaning more in the bag for next year already) plus the acceleration in recognized growth (meaning the flywheel is turning faster), you may very well conclude the same. We would be surprised if the company grew by just 36% this year - we would expect 40% plus, all other things being equal.We moved to Buy for subscribers yesterday when the stock was at $131.50; the stock is up about 6% at the time of writing since then. We think there's more to come and remain at Buy.Cestrian Capital Research, Inc - 10 September 2020."
4375272,105510,2020-09-19T07:08:37-04:00,"Zscaler has been a key beneficiary of COVID-driven shifts in work preferences.But signs of normalization are emerging as we roll off the 3Q/4Q peak.I question the sustainability of current revenue growth momentum, particularly given the competitive risks.With ZS stock already trading at a very rich multiple, any disappointments in the upcoming quarters could drive significant downside.","Zscaler's (NASDAQ:ZS) recent earnings report offered plenty of positives and largely affirmed my positive view of its long-term positioning as a secular beneficiary of the shift toward secure and efficient access for remote work. That said, there are competitive risks on the horizon, particularly from Palo Alto Networks' (NYSE:PANW) Prisma Access. I also question the sustainability of the exceedingly strong billings momentum in recent quarters and how the trajectory changes post-COVID.Like many of its software peers, multiples have also meaningfully re-rated - ZS's current ~28x fwd EV/Sales multiple screens expensively even relative to its security and SaaS peers. Perhaps it's my value bias talking here, but I tend to favor buying stocks on disappointment (vs. the rampant optimism in ZS). High multiples need to be matched with high expectations, and I'm just not seeing how the price matches the value at these levels.Data by YChartsThere was a lot in the recent 4Q earnings report for growth investors - revenue growth of 46% YoY was handily above consensus, driving $125.9m in quarterly revenue. Billings of $194.9 million further outpaced revenue growth (+55% YoY) on increased adoption of both Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). The latter offering has been particularly strong and now accounts for ~29% of new/upsell business in FY20 (vs. ~14% in FY19).Source: Investor PresentationThe revenue strength in 4Q largely justifies management's decision to reinvest into the business via expanded sales capacity (+60% headcount in FY20) and a broader solution portfolio. Net retention has also remained strong throughout, coming in at 120% (up from 118% a year ago and 119% in the prior quarter), allowing ZS to step up sales of ZIA and ZPA throughout the existing customer base and new customers as well. In total, ZS's customer base reached 4,500 (+15% Y/Y), with smaller businesses (i.e., non G2K) driving much of the growth this time around.Source: 10-K FilingTellingly, though, 4Q activity has been more balanced relative to the prior quarter, which saw accelerated adoption of ZPA as enterprises rushed to improve access amid COVID-driven lockdowns. While ZPA did still account for ~29% of new and add-on Annualized Contract Value (ACV) for the full year, it was still well off the 3Q peak (~43% contribution).There was a price to pay for all that growth - gross margins for 4Q were impacted by ZS's ""augmented use"" of Azure/AWS to meet the surge in traffic (ZPA traffic was up >10x). Going forward, ZPA and ZIA margins should improve as ZS moves back to its data centers, but newer products like ZDX still run on Azure, so incremental growth here will be a short-term headwind to margins. But no worries longer term - as Zscaler scales and moves these products to ZS cloud, margins will naturally expand in line with ZPA and ZIA.Source: Earnings ReleaseOperating margins at 6.2% benefited from operating leverage, particularly at the sales/marketing line, as incremental revenue largely dropped through to the bottom line. On a YoY basis, Q4 (non-GAAP) margins still declined 200-300bps, though, as management did not let up on investments, particularly in the buildout of ZS's go-to-market initiatives.Source: Earnings ReleaseThat said, management still guided for FY21 operating margins to remain roughly flat YoY at ~8%, reflecting continued investments in building out the sales force. No changes to the long-term margin outlook, though, as guidance remains for 20-22% by FY24, which implies a fair bit of optimism around the margin expansion path post-FY21.The revenue guide was well above consensus for both 1Q and FY21, though skeptics like myself were likely watching the FY21 billings guidance a lot more closely. The current forward year guide at $710-720m implies ~30% billings growth YoY, a notable deceleration from the ~41% YoY growth in FY20.Source: Earnings ReleaseThat said, there wasn't much qualitatively to suggest ZS's 3Q/4Q outperformance were one-offs - commentary was bullish on the pipeline and the aggressive hiring/investment plans in the year ahead. Thus, the key debate likely turns to the durability of the current momentum in a post-COVID world. The slower billings guide would seem to point toward some demand pull-forward in FY20, but if we are at the cusp of an accelerated shift into cloud-based Zero Trust architectures, these numbers could well prove conservative.A key tenet of the ZS bull case is its improved positioning post-COVID, as the company looks to accelerate the displacement of incumbents (e.g., Symantec Blue Coat with ZIA in secure web gateway). But with next-generation firewall (NGFW) players all moving into cloud-delivered arenas, the competition looks set to heat up. In particular, competition from similar firewall-as-a-service offerings like Cisco (CSCO) Umbrella and Palo Alto Networks Prisma could slow ZS's momentum going forward.Prisma Access, for instance, has comparable use cases, and given PANW already has a large installed base and established enterprise relationships, I think ZS's cloud platform could come under pressure - even if it is more mature. Expect the competition to move beyond feature gaps into pricing (e.g., discounting tactics) as differentiation becomes more challenging. As the following responses from ETR+ suggest, ZS's price increases earlier this year have not been popular - expect pricing pressure on upcoming renewals.Source: ETR.PlusAnother key adverse implication of a competitive marketplace is the shift in customer mix toward small business customers - a segment that typically comes with higher churn (and by extension, lower retention). Thus, while the company is moving ahead with its investment plans in anticipation of future growth, the >20% medium-term margin target is far from a given.ZS has clearly been a significant beneficiary of the work-from-home shift in recent quarters, but the sustainability of current growth trends is in question. Specifically, I question how much demand has been pulled forward in 3Q/4Q, particularly amongst existing customers. Plus, competitive risks are also top of mind, and the emergence of comparable offerings such as PANW's Prisma could see pricing come under pressure in the upcoming quarters.That said, I do acknowledge the secular tailwinds around remote working and Zero Trust Architectures (a security approach treating all network traffic as untrusted), with improving sales productivity potentially driving upside to the FY21 guidance. But I wonder how much of this has been priced in at the current ~28x fwd revenue multiple, which screens expensively even by SaaS standards. With a fair bit of optimism already priced in, it might be better to await a better entry point to get more constructive on the stock.A quick note on additional risks - given ZS's move to rapidly expand its sales force to build new pipeline opportunities (+60% YoY headcount growth), I also expect some degree of sales disruption in the short term under new sales leadership. Additionally, ZS's exposure to larger transformational deals also leaves it exposed to longer sales cycles in the current environment. Should these risks filter through to the P&L in the coming quarters, I see the potential for significant multiple compression."

ZS reported revenue of $125.9 million versus the consensus estimate of $118.8 million. Revenue was up 46% Y/Y, accelerating from 40% in the prior quarter. ZS reported billings of $195 million, again beating the consensus estimate of $176 million. Billings grew 55% Y/Y, in line with the previous quarter. EPS was $0.05 versus the consensus estimate of $0.03.The company provided F1Q21 revenue guidance in the range of $131-133 million, which was above prior consensus of $127 million. ZS guided EPS in the range of $0.05-0.06, which is again above the previous consensus estimate of $0.04. For the full-year fiscal 2021, the company guided revenue in the $580-590 million range, versus the previous consensus estimate of $566. ZS guided EPS in the $0.28-0.30 range, versus the prior consensus estimate of $0.29.ZS beat estimates on every metric it guided and was exuberant on its prospects. We believe the company is becoming the de facto standard for securing remote workforces and accessing applications both on-prem and in the cloud. Given its solid execution, first-mover advantage, deep moat, we are buying the stock on the dips due to the lofty valuation. The following chart illustrates the key metrics for Q42020.Source: Zscaler PresentationBusinesses worldwide are transforming their businesses by automating large parts of their operations by what is called Digital Transformation (DX). DX is a top priority of CEO/CIOs, as DX enables companies to become more agile and efficient in serving their customers and their partners. To digitize their operations, enterprises are now running applications in multiple public clouds such as Amazon (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) Azure, or Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) GCP. Also, enterprises are using applications such as Salesforce (CRM), Veeva (VEEV), Workday (WDAY), which are all hosted in the cloud. Despite the trend above, a majority of applications continue to remain on-premises data centers.On top of the DX trend, COVID is forcing employees to Work From Home (WFH). In a situation where users are accessing applications and data from anywhere, and where the applications and data are located both on-prem and in the cloud, enterprises need to rethink their security strategy. ZS is in the business of providing secure access to applications from wherever the users are located.ZS's security-as-a-service is the best solution to secure users, applications, and their data, wherever located. While COVID drove WFH initially, we believe many enterprises will let their employees work remotely once the pandemic ends. This remote work will continue to drive the business of securing remote users for ZS. As digital transformation accelerates over the next few months and years, we expect ZS to benefit from this trend. We believe ZS revenue will continue to grow in the mid-to-high 30% for the next several years.Cloud/SaaS applications and Office365 access are currently driving ZS's business. ZS provides secure access to these applications by Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) product. With SD-WAN, Work-From-Anywhere (WFA) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) growing in importance in the enterprise, ZS believes these trends will accelerate demand for its ZIA business. The company has other products such as Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) to address applications within various clouds and on-prem. Enterprises are giving access to on-prem and cloud applications to its customers and partners. To connect these users with applications securely, ZPA is being used. According to ZS, ZPA is the fastest-growing product in the company's portfolio. The following chart illustrates the present and future drivers of growth for ZS.Source: Zscaler presentationZS is executing well on both the product side as well as on the sales side of its operations. ZS is now a multi-product company, having expanded from its flagship ZIA product at the time of its IPO to now having three other products – ZPA, Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX), and Workload Segmentation. The following chart illustrates ZS's expanding product portfolio.Source: Zscaler PresentationZS has expanded the product portfolio from ZIA (Users to the Internet) and ZPA (User to Private Applications) to ZDX (User App experience) and App-to-App communications products. The majority of the revenue currently comes from ZIA and ZPA, but we expect ZDX and App-to-App communication to drive growth in 2021 and beyond.To augment its product families and fill the gaps within its product portfolio, the company is making small tuck-in technology acquisitions. These acquisitions are then deeply integrated into its core platform and rolled out to all its customers worldwide. The company acquired Appsulate (browser isolation), Edgewise (Zero Trust App Segmentation), Cloudneeti (Cloud Security Posture Management), and TrustPath (AI/ML technology) for real-time security analysis. We expect ZS to make additional tuck-in acquisitions to fill gaps in its portfolio and to drive new growth.The federal business could be another growth driver for the company. ZS made significant investments in growing its federal business. To sell to federal customers, software providers need to achieve FedRamp certification for each product they sell. ZS achieved FedRamp High certification for its ZPA product and also achieved FedRamp In Progress certification for its ZIA product. The company expects FedRamp High certification for ZIA to be granted later this year or early next. We expect the Federal segment to be a good revenue contributor in the future.We believe significant upsell opportunity exists for ZS. The company believes it can significantly upsell ZPA and other new products into its install base. The company noted that out of 450 of its Global 2000 customers, only 1/3 (150 of them) had purchased ZPA, with 2/3rd still to go. In a similar vein, the newer products such as ZDX have a handful of customers with no meaningful revenue yet. ZS's management believes that it can sell ZDX and ZPA widely across the install base. On top of this, the company has newer products such as Application Segmentation, which should drive growth in the future. Application-to-Application security will be a significant theme in the future, especially when applications are built using containers and microservices.When valuing ZS, we use EV/Sales as the primary valuation metric. Given that many of the companies in the peer group are currently in transition to a SaaS/Subscription revenue model or not sufficiently profitable, EV/Sales makes the comparisons meaningful. Also, in a takeout scenario, one of the primary metrics used to evaluate takeout price remains EV/Sales. EV/Sales makes it easier to compare with historical takeout multiples.ZS is currently trading at 20.4x EV/C2022 sales, well above the peer group average of 11.7x, despite growing 5% above the peer group average. ZS is forecasted to grow at 29%, versus the SaaS peer group at around 24%. ZScaler's multiple is 175% higher than the SaaS/Subscription peer group. The following charts illustrate the valuation of the SaaS and the Security peer group.Source: Author based on Refinitiv dataSource: Author based on Refinitiv dataAs the preceding charts indicate, ZS is given a significantly higher multiple than many of its peers, such as CRWD, DT, FSLY, SPLK, PANW, etc. We believe ZS is afforded one of the highest multiple in security given its deep moat, leading customer base, lack of decent competition, and execution. We believe ZS is perfectly positioned for two of the biggest secular trends in the enterprise – remote and mobile workforce and digital transformation. Both DX and WFA will drive growth in the near term, but DX will remain the main driver for growth for an extended period.After the company's blockbuster 4Q21 results, many well-known analysts on the street raised their Price Targets (PT) for the stock. According to Refinitiv data, the median PT on the Street is $153, and the mean PT is $143. Based on the same Refinitiv data, out of the 24 analysts covering the stock, 12 are buy, and the remaining are hold, as the following chart illustrates.Source: Author based on Refinitiv dataOver the last 12 months, ZS significantly outperformed both the Nasdaq as well as S&P 500. ZS is up about 159%, while the Nasdaq is up only 33%. The following chart illustrates ZS's performance relative to the market.ZS significantly outperformed both OKTA (OKTA) and CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD). We believe ZS has no compelling competition in the enterprise that can scale. Any competition to ZS to materialize will take a few years of sustained investment. Given this, we are bullish on ZS's growth trajectory.We expect ZS to continue to grow for the next several years, given that DX is still in the early innings. Given our belief that ZS will remain a core technology to secure users and applications, we will be buying shares opportunistically and in small increments while accumulating a decent position over time."

The multiple investors are willing to pay to participate in this SaaS business is ultimately misaligned with its near-term prospects.There's no question that the demand for access to internally managed applications through secure platforms will continue to be in very high demand as our economy shifts towards a work-from-home economy.The question here is whether investors' expectations have got slightly ahead of themselves.I argue that paying more than 25x to 27x forward sales for a company with a clear line of sight towards a decelerating revenue growth rate is simply too high a multiple to leave investors with any further upside potential. Ultimately, investors should look to sidestep this opportunity. Here's why:Note: Don't forget to check out the video!Source: author's calculations, ***fiscal 2020 guidanceThe key takeaway from Zscaler is that revenue growth rates are starting to come down. If the period of fiscal 2017-2019 was marked by strong and steady revenue growth rates, fiscal 2020 is seeing a marked deceleration of more than 1,800 basis points - assuming that Zscaler is low balling its guidance so it can it beat its own guidance.In fact, we know that Q4 2020 is guided towards 38% revenue growth rates, so this implies that Zscaler's exit Q4 2020 rate is now more likely than not going to grow its revenues at 40% into fiscal 2021. But this story doesn't end here.Confounding the story is that calculating billings in Q3 2020 jumped back up to 55%:Source: Q3 2020 resultsIrrespective of the position bears have on whether or not Zscaler is slowing down, calculating billings are a strong indication that Zscaler's future orders are looking healthy. These are orders that have been booked in but not yet recognized.For now, there has been a dramatic slow down in Zscaler's Q4 2020 run rate compared with its growth rates just 12 months ago.Meanwhile, I don't believe it has a strong enough path to profitability to compensate for this revenue growth rate deceleration. Consider the following:We can see that despite Zscaler's growth rates coming down, its non-GAAP operating margins are still only hovering around 10%. What's more, we should remember that Zscaler's biggest cost is retaining its talented executive team.Put another way, Zscaler's biggest cost is in the form of stock-based compensation, as these real costs will later translate themselves as management exercises their options and the market cap starts to ballon higher.Case in point: On a GAAP metric, Zscaler's operating margins for Q3 2020 was firmly in the red at negative 18%.The brutal question investors should be asking themselves is whether, in the post-COVID environment, the rate of growth will be sustainable.Put another way, even though during work-from-home there was a rapid swing towards digitization and securitization of users, will the pace of growth will be there in fiscal 2021 and beyond?This is the most difficult question to try to objectively answer. Indeed, looking in the rear view, there's no question that Zscaler was well position to benefit from this unexpected boom in demand.The question right now is: Can investors can bank on a similar unexpected boom next year? Or will enterprises continue over the next 12 months to adopt Zscaler for their needs in a zero trust environment?Source: author's calculations, using trailing sales metricsThe obvious observation above is that investors are tripping over themselves to pay an ever-increasing multiple for Zscaler. If 2019 investors paying 18x sales looked reasonable for a SaaS company, right now, paying 38x trailing sales is anything but reasonable.Source: SA Premium ToolsAgain, we can see that the Street is expecting Zscaler's revenue growth rate to continue to slow down to roughly 31% next year, putting Zscaler at approximately 27x forward sales.Consequently, it appears that even though Zscaler's sales trajectory is pointing overwhelmingly in one direction, the multiple investors are willing to pay to participate in this narrative is pointing in the diametrically opposite direction.I'm concerned that as Zscaler gets into H2 2021, and it comes to lap the results from this year, it will struggle to grow anywhere near in line with investors' expectations.There appears to be too much optimism here and not enough doubt among shareholders. Even if we assume that Zscaler's fiscal 2021 guidance given at the end of next quarter positively impresses the Street, investors are still having to pay at least 25x to 27x forward sales. This type of valuation in the absolutely best case scenario is justified if Zscaler outperforms significantly every quarter over the coming 12 months. But any mishap in execution will be met with a very rapid sell-off by shareholders."
4373461,69905,2020-09-10T05:31:07-04:00,"Guidance comes in stronger than expected, but Zscaler doesn't appear to be benefitting much from the COVID ''work from anywhere'' narrative.Billings were strong, and RPO are also at a healthy level, but its Rule of 40 is middle of the road.Zscaler's trade may be starting to run out of steam as expectations got ahead of themselves, leaving new investors with unimpressive upside potential.","Zscaler (ZS) had rallied hugely into its earnings these past several months.It was a case of buying the rumor and selling the news, as investors' reactions echo the sentiment we have seen the past week, where investors want to be positively surprised to continue the ''work from home'' trading theme.Presently, Zscaler trades for 29x forward sales, and investors are not seeing enough upside potential here.Indeed, given that its revenue growth rates are guided to decelerate, I posit that Zscaler won't offer new investors an attractive investment opportunity. Investors could consider this stock at a lower entry point. Here's why:Zscaler offers customers a cloud-native platform for securely connecting users to applications. It is set up to benefit from users needing secure access to internal applications in a zero-trust environment.During COVID, this cloud security company should be seeing a strong and sustained benefit as companies are forced to take their networks from premises towards the cloud.However, as we can see below from Zscaler's high-end guidance, that narrative doesn't seem to be playing out:Source: author's calculations; **high-end company guidanceConsider this, if we look back over Zscaler's fiscal 2020 (calendar 2019-2020), in the pre-COVID environment Zscaler was actually growing at a faster pace than it has guided for the upcoming year.To illustrate, if we see that Q1 2021 is guided to grow at 42% y/y (high-end guidance) and Zscaler's fiscal 2021 is expected to finish up 37% y/y, this implies that H2 2021 should be seeing some deceleration compared with the first half of 2021.Having said that, we can see that Zscaler's guidance is meaningfully stronger than analysts were expecting, with Q1 2021 expected to reach around 36%, whereas management's high-guidance points to a 600 basis point beat compared with The Street's estimate.Source: SA Premium ToolsSource: Q4 2020 Investor PresentationAs readers will know, billings in the SaaS world are viewed as a forward indicator of companies' revenue prospects as companies book customers upfront and recognize revenue over time.On this note, Zscaler delivers very reassuring and healthy billings growth of 55% y/y. The fact that billings remain so strong is certainly positive and reassuring for shareholders.Similarly, Zscaler's remaining performance obligations (''RPO'') are up 41% from one year ago, further noting that its pipeline remains strong.Another positive attribute of Zscaler is that it has been set up for operating on a large scale. In fact, its essentially in its name, as Zscaler stands for Zenith of Scalability.Accordingly, given that subsystems have been optimized for high throughput, this reduces the number of servers needed, which translates into high gross profit margins.Source: Q4 2020 Investor PresentationGiven that Zscaler processes more than 120 billion transactions, this large data set uses AI for better recognition and detection of anomalies.Compared with other network security vendors, Zsaler argues that its biggest advantage over its peers is that its fully cloud-native, rather than having to retrofit their legacy operations to the cloud.From an investors' perspective, despite Zscaler reporting what would typically have been a strong set of results, the stock didn't move all that much after hours.Having said that, compared with its peer CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD), the stock performed meaningfully better.However, if we take a step back, we should bear in mind that Zscaler already trades at 29x forward sales (fiscal 2021 revenues). This is a punchy valuation for a stock that has had a very strong run already and close to tripled in 2020.Furthermore, when investors look around, it appears to be that theme we have seen these past few days with the likes of Slack (WORK), CrowdStrike, and PagerDuty (PD): all these companies have failed to impress investors despite reporting strong numbers.Consider this, as I made the case for my Marketplace Deep Value Returns members, CrowdStrike is trading for 25x its fiscal 2022 sales (ends in January 2022). Thus, CrowdStrike is growing at a meaningfully faster pace while it arguably trades cheaper that Zscaler.Having said that, despite Zscaler's valuation being punchy, on a Rule of 40 metric, for the year ahead it should at the top end fall into 45% -- implying a healthy balance of growth and profitability.On the other hand, for comparison, CrowdStrike's Rule of 40 for its fiscal 2021 is higher than 70%. There are some minor adjustments that don't fully overlap in the two companies, but this comparison works for our purposes, and it reinforces that Zscaler doesn't leave investors with sufficient upside potential.Zscaler reported a strong set of results, yet the market barely reacted. Why? Because the stock had close to tripled already in 2020, and investors are looking to be overly impressed to drive its shares forward.Investors are being asked to pay more than 29x next year's revenues for a company that is seeing its growth rates starting to tail off. It appears that the ''work from home'' trade is starting to lose its appeal with investors."
4358101,104608,2020-07-13T09:02:01-04:00,"Zscaler continues to demonstrate very strong revenue and billings growth and are a clear beneficiary of the work from home environment.
        Management recently raised their full year guidance, though investors will continue to expect strong performance over the next several quarters.
        The biggest pushback with this name is valuation, which is currently ~38x forward revenue, implying strong results over the next several quarters.","Zscaler (ZS) recently reported a much better than expected Q3 a while back, with revenue growth actually accelerating to 40% and billings growth remaining even more impressive at 55%. This company has been a clear beneficiary of enterprises transitioning to a work from home environment as the need for seamless internet security has increased more than ever.Given the strength during the quarter and strong underlying demand trends in the market, management raised their guidance for the full year. Investors quickly solidified their bullish positions in the name given the secular trend of working from home could stay for a long time.In addition, the company announced the pricing of a new $1 billion convertible senior note due 2025, with an interest rate of only 0.125%, pretty much free money. While the company maintains a strong balance sheet with good liquidity, the extra $1 billion will help as they continue to re-invest heavily into the company to achieve strong growth.The company has historically beat and raised expectations during the quarterly earnings reports, however the current valuations seems to already bake in very strong results over the next two years. At over 24x FY22 revenue, that being two full years out, I find it challenging for valuation to push much higher in the near-term.Billings growth during the most recent quarter was very strong at 55% and this could translate into near-term revenue growth above expectations. However, with current valuation already baking this into the stock price, investors should use a little more caution when looking to build a position in the name ahead of the quarter. Nevertheless, the company is poised to maintain their above average revenue growth rates for the next few years, leading to a long-term buy on the name.Revenue during the quarter grew an impressive 40% to $110.5 million, which was nicely above expectations for ~$106 million and actually accelerated from the 36% growth last quarter despite the more challenging macroeconomic environment. As companies started to increase their workloads from home, the need to have strong and secure internet security has increased in tandem.Source: Company PresentationBillings continue to be a good indicator for future growth, as billings collectively represent deals the company has won but have not yet collected revenue on. Billings grew 55% to $131.3 million, a significant improvement from only 18% growth last quarter. Despite significant growth and expenses from transitioning to a work from home environment, the company reported operating margins of 8%, which were similar to the year ago period. Investors will start to focus more on profitability levels over the next few quarters given revenue growth is not likely to continue to accelerate longer-term.Given the strong performance during Q3 and continued strength in underlying trends, the company raised their full-year revenue guidance to $422-424 million, up from the previous range of $414-417 million. Billings were also raised to $529-531 million, up from $512-517 million. While there is only one quarter left during the company's fiscal year, investors have already started to focus on FY21 and FY22 for valuation purposes.A few weeks ago, the company announced the pricing of their new $1 billion 2025 convertible senior note, with an interest rate of only 0.125%. To many investors, that's pretty much a free $1 billion check for the company to re-invest into their business.Zscaler has benefited immensely from the transition to a work from home environment, as many companies look to increase their internet security protocols. This extra $1 billion gives Zscaler increased ammunition to invest in near-term projects in order to capture additional customers. While the company likely did not absolutely need to $1 billion at this time, with such a low interest rate and with customer demand spiking in the near term, it makes sense.The low interest rate will require minimal interest expense over the next five years and the benefit of immediately using the $1 billion far outweighs the interest expense payments. Since the company announced this a few weeks ago, investors welcomed the cash and the stock has been up 15% since.After reporting earnings a few weeks ago, the stock initially popped nearly 45% the following two days and has increased even more after the senior note offering. Like many other investors, I immediately looked at valuation to understand whether or not this significant pop was well deserved or a bit over-hyped.The company reported a very strong quarter for both revenue and billings growth, which undermines the company's success they are seeing in their salesforce and the current demand from customers. The rapid shift to working from home has caused many enterprises to re-evaluate their technology spending and direct security spending to the right buckets. With employees working outside of the office, the need to have superior internet security increases dramatically, thus, Zscaler's services have become even more valuable than before.Over the long-term, Zscaler will continue to benefit from more companies maintaining a work from home environment. The company is poised to remain a market leader for many years to come and long-term investors should feel confident about their positioning.The above chart does a good job showing just a few of the winners resulting from the global pandemic and the massive shift to corporations encouraging employees to work from home. All of these companies have one main thing in common, they offer software subscription services that are relatively simple to implement in a work from home environment. Thus, they have all seen their forward revenue multiples expand significantly.The stock has a current market cap of ~$16.4 billion and with cash of ~$400 million and now $1 billion debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$17.0 billion. While management recently raised their FY20 revenue guidance to $422-424 million, we should start to look at both FY21 and FY22 for a better understanding of valuation.Currently, expectations for FY21 are revenue of ~$555 million, or just over 30% growth for the year. This also represents a current valuation of ~30.6x FY21 revenue. However, the company has seen a lot of success with their sales and demand, and growth could actually come in above expectations next year. When looking at FY22, revenue could grow another 25%, which means we could see revenue reach ~$700 million. Using this for FY22, this means valuation is 24.3x FY22 revenue.While valuation does remain at the high end of comparable software-based companies, Zscaler continues to grow revenue at impressive rates and current expectations could prove to be conservative. Billings growth demonstrates the strong underlying demand in the marketplace and as the company continues to gain scale, they will become better positioned to benefit from economies of scaleI remain a long-term bull for Zscaler, however at the current valuation, revenue growth needs to sustain at least 25%+ over the next two years for the current valuation to begin to be justified. Anything short of that would mean the sock is overvalued and investors should start using a little more cautious around this name."

Zscaler is using this strategy to pull away from competitors in the network security space.The recent DoD win makes its sales and marketing activities easier. This will further strengthen its brand positioning.Zscaler's valuation remains elevated. Regardless, investors with the faith in its new bets can prepare for another cycle of value creation.","Source: ZscalerZscaler's (ZS) valuation has been rewarded for its preparedness for the demand-side tailwinds it currently enjoys. Zscaler doesn't have the time to celebrate this victory due to pressure from competitors. Innovation is not new to Zscaler, and it will tap this power to create more cloud security solutions before competitors spot them. Investors with an abundant risk appetite should focus on the huge potentials in the cloud security space. Zscaler's potential to drive more growth from its new products and solutions will continue to propel its growth factor.Globalization-Billings-ARR-ACV-SASE-Cloud-LatencyZscaler outperformed last quarter. Its offerings are used by companies in over 158 countries across the globe. With more companies migrating to public and private cloud platforms, the deployment of its products has been accelerated. Its ability to spin up new cloud VMs (virtual machines) using public cloud platforms, in addition to its network of data centers strategically located across the globe, means extending the breadth of its reach will be easy. This will ensure Zscaler can leverage its expertise to make the trade-off between the speed of deployment and quality of service after deployment to provide the best service to its customers.Revenue came in above expectations last quarter due to the huge demand for ZIA (employees accessing internet apps) and ZPA (employees accessing private). Existing customers without ZPA and new customers buying both ZPA and ZIA drove demand. Because of the ease of deployment, Zscaler was able to win a lot of new deals, expand existing deals, while getting customers to make long-term commitments. As a result, metrics like ARR (reflects future growth least likely to churn), ACV (reflects up-sell and cross-sell), and RPO (reflects long-term service and support commitments) came in above expectations. Billings also outperformed as Zscaler was able to get more cash to shore up its liquidity.Going forward, a mix of favorable near- and long-term trends (WFH, network transformation, cloud adoption) will drive sustainable growth. This will be assisted by Zscaler's ability to provide the best of breed security solutions and its significantly improved brand posture after the recent DoD win.Platform-Land & Expand-ZTNA-Margins-FCF-LiquidityProductsZscaler is a cloud-focused security platform. Its land and expand strategy has been accelerated by the adoption of cloud platforms. This has enabled it to cross-sell ZPA to employees accessing private networks. Like most cloud platforms, the returns investors are enjoying today are outcomes of strategic bets that were made with the conviction that ""cloud will eat the world."" Software did it first. Mobile is set to grab the next bite.In its usual innovative way, readers will observe that Zscaler is adding more capabilities to its cloud products and platform. This will expand the breadth of its solutions. New features include remote browser isolation for ZIA, and cloud security posture management (from the acquisition of Cloudnetti). RBI is like a sandbox for serving web content to eliminate web-based threats. CSPM is for assessing the security posture of cloud assets. As more companies migrate workloads to the cloud, the complexity of those workloads will grow. This will provide an opportunity for Zscaler to offer cloud security solutions for cloud workloads. ZPA supports the two biggest cloud infrastructure providers (Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT) and AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN)). With time, Zscaler will expand its coverage to more cloud platforms to help customers protect their cloud deployments.Going forward, Zscaler's cloud platform will help it leverage its capabilities to provide tons of cloud security solutions that are yet to be imagined. It will also fast track easy partnerships with cloud providers. For example, Zscaler is able to partner with VMware (VMW) VeloCloud to power its SD-WAN capabilities. This partnership would have been tough without an extensible platform.FinancialsSource: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Zscaler's gross margin was impacted by the necessity to provide cloud security services in short notice as the WFH trend gathered steam. Going forward, margins will return to the historical rate as Zscaler normalizes these deployments. Zscaler now has tons of solutions to sell to its installed base. Hiring will assist greenfield wins and upsell. Its DoD project win will provide an easy sales pitch for its sales reps. This is also a nice brand advantage for marketing to leverage going forward. I see Zscaler winning deals that would have been tough to land due to the DoD win.Zscaler has a debt-free balance sheet. Deferred revenue will continue to drive asset growth and operating cash flow. This will be assisted by share-based compensation. Share-based compensation transfers the huge early-stage cost of capital problem to the EPS line. In a market with significant multiple expansion, potential EPS dilution isn't much of a concern. Zscaler has a lot of favorable factors to accelerate its growth factor — the future points to more partnerships and innovation of products to provide more solutions.Integrations-Acquisitions-Partnerships-International ExpansionZscaler's extensibility has driven the ease of its integration with other platforms. Zscaler has benefitted from some of the integrations forged from partnerships with platforms like Azure. Competitive worries from partnerships can be de-emphasized when businesses are in their growth stage. Integrations with competitors like the recent CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD) partnership helps platforms growth-hack each other while improving customer satisfaction/retention when customers prefer to combine capabilities from different platforms. Zscaler hasn't hesitated to acquire capabilities where it deems it fit. Adding more capabilities in areas like threat intelligence, EDR, and SD-WAN will reduce its reliance on the partnership strategy.Going forward, Zscaler will continue to face competitive pressure from network security vendors like Fortinet (FTNT) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). Top network security vendors have acquired the technical capabilities to provide cloud security at scale. They have also acquired capabilities beyond cloud security to cross-sell to their installed base. The result of this could lead to pricing pressure to land new deals.Network Effect-Economies Of Scale-Switching Cost-Momentum-AnalystsSource: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Zscaler's expertise in deploying cloud security solutions will give it an edge as more enterprises focus on latency and QoS (quality of service). This capability and advantage will fuel its growth factor, which has helped its momentum.Analysts are less optimistic after the billings outperformance due to its expensive valuation. Compared to its peers, Zscaler is fairly valued. Though, its strict cloud focus means its new innovations will be tough to compete with. Its product retention and expansion are attractive.Source: AuthorThe biggest risk factor with Zscaler is competition. There are enough network security players interested in cloud security. Network security players have the expertise to deliver excellent security services. They have the ability to provide attractive security bundles to win new customers. This explains Zscaler's speed of innovation to improve its platform while adding more features to ZIA to drive customer retention. Another near-term challenge to its growth factor will come from EMEA deals with long sales cycles. Zscaler's liquidity position has improved due to the recent billings outperformance. Investors should also watch the tech sector oversubscription risk. Cloud stocks are overvalued by historical measures.Source: Author (using data from YCharts)In periods of favorable demand-side tailwinds, Zscaler will win because it has the right cloud security capabilities. However, competition from network security players can slow its momentum. Its valuation ratios are tough to justify.

        Investors may be starting to put a cap on Zscaler's valuation, which at ~24x forward revenues is among the most expensive stocks in the market.
        Zscaler saw strong revenue and billings growth in Q3, though contract durations shortened slightly.
        Though Zscaler has seen tremendous growth, it has failed to materially improve its profit margins. Gross margins even fell in the most recent quarter.","Ever since its IPO in 2018 at just $16 per share, Zscaler (ZS) has been one of the stock market darlings that investors have loved to chase upward. The company can seemingly do no wrong, and to its own credit, Zscaler's fundamentals have been fantastic. Two years into its public debut, Zscaler is still growing top-line revenue and billings in the 40-50% y/y range, even as the company approaches a half-billion annual revenue run rate. Not very many companies can lay claim to these feats.The coronavirus, however, really cemented Zscaler's story. With the rise of work-from-home and the increasing reliance on logging onto work applications that are hosted in public clouds, Zscaler's cloud-friendly ""security as a service"" platform has garnered a lot more attention and utility, and Zscaler's billings have shot through the roof on new implementations. Shares followed suit, with Zscaler's stock up more than 2x in the year-to-date.But investors who are attempting to chase Zscaler upward should not be blind to its valuation. Right now, the market is chasing cloud-centered technology stocks almost like they're defensive plays, and traditional valuation metrics have gone out the window. But as the coronavirus begins to fade from being the primary market mover, and as stocks in the travel/retail sectors begin to recover, these heavily overbought names will start to look incredibly overvalued.It's true that the coronavirus has accelerated Zscaler's goal of cornering the security market. Traditional firewall providers like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) were already lagging behind, but services like Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA), which protects corporate users as they log into applications over the internet, have become increasingly more critical. But as Zscaler's revenue scale has expanded, its valuation multiple has rocketed upward by a disproportionate amount.At current share prices near $104, Zscaler trades at a market cap of $13.61 billion. After we net off the $391.3 million of cash on Zscaler's most recent balance sheet (the company is still in the process of raising a ~$1 billion convertible bond offering), we arrive at an enterprise value of $13.22 billion.For the next fiscal year (Zscaler is currently in its fourth fiscal quarter), Wall Street analysts are expecting consensus revenue of $555.0 million, per Yahoo Finance, representing 31% y/y growth over this year's guided revenue range of $422-$424 million. Against that consensus view, Zscaler trades at a mammoth 23.8x EV/FY21 revenues. Not very many software companies ever reach this valuation echelon, and very few still can continue rising above that. It's worthwhile to point out that Zscaler trades at a richer multiple of forward revenues than the S&P 500 trades at as a multiple of GAAP earnings. As such, Zscaler is essentially priced for perfection and even the slightest misstep could cause its huge year-to-date gains to unwind.I'd exercise caution here and wait for share prices to cool off before considering an investment.I'll stress again here that the focal point of this thesis is that Zscaler is too expensive to be a good long position, not that the company itself isn't doing well. Take a look at the company's most recent quarterly results below:Figure 1. Zscaler 3Q20 resultsSource: Zscaler 3Q20 earnings releaseZscaler's revenues grew 40% y/y to $110.5 million in Q3, far surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $106.2 million (+34% y/y) by a six-point margin. Zscaler's billings showed an even better story. Coming off a weak 18% y/y billings quarter in Q2 (though this was largely due to an unfavorable one-time deal comp in the prior-year Q2), Zscaler managed to grow billings at a fantastic 55% y/y rate to $131.3 million. As seasoned software investors are aware, this is a solid forward-looking indicator of Zscaler's revenue pipeline over the next few quarters. The only slight weakness on the top-line front is that Zscaler's contract durations shortened slightly in the quarter, as the company began offering shorter contract terms to stimulate demand in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.Figure 2. Zscaler billings resultsSource: Zscaler 3Q20 earnings releaseTwo factors influenced Zscaler's strong performance in the quarter. First, as a remote work-oriented stock that helps companies manage and secure logins, Zscaler saw a lot of natural demand generation in the quarter. Per CFO Remo Canessa's prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:The demand environment notwithstanding, Zscaler itself has been preparing for stronger execution by building out a larger and more tenured sales force - which, for any high-growth software company, is the biggest variable in determining revenue growth rates. Here are CEO Jay Chaudhry's comments on sales team development:Despite (or perhaps because of) strong sales momentum, however, Zscaler lagged behind on the profitability front. Higher usage of its products forced Zscaler to lean more on expensive public cloud hosting, which caused a two-point reduction in pro forma gross margins. Figure 3. Zscaler 3Q20 margin trendsSource: Zscaler 3Q20 earnings releaseThe good news is that, with margins in the ~80% range, Zscaler is already in the top tier among software margins, and management does expect this headwind to fade. We are disappointed, however, that in spite of strong sales growth and the fact that sales expenses should be dramatically lower (due to a stoppage of travel and client events), Zscaler's pro forma operating margins still remained flat year-over-year at 8%.Again, this margin profile is still strong (many high-growth software companies are still showing negative operating margins), but Zscaler is already priced for perfection - so we should expect margin expansion along side strong top-line growth.Enthusiasm for Zscaler as a key vendor in the remote work trend is valid, but it has certainly run too hot this year. Investors should be wary of a multiples compression in Zscaler - a ~24x forward revenue valuation that isn't also supported by meaningful earnings or cash flow is difficult to defend. Stay on the sidelines here."

Zscaler’s stock has benefited from the COVID-19 work-from-home narrative but it is yet to be seen how large an impact this will have on the company’s finances. Zscaler is richly valued given its declining growth rate and stiff competition and investors may benefit by waiting for a more attractive entry point into the stock.The shift towards cloud infrastructure and cloud deployed applications, along with increased internet traffic and a proliferation of endpoints, has resulted in the internet becoming the new corporate network and the cloud becoming the new data center. This shift is being driven by enterprise demand for greater IT agility and lower costs and is creating changing network security requirements.Table 1: Development of Cybersecurity Market (Source: Created by author based on data from Check Point Software)Traditional security approaches focused on establishing a perimeter around the corporate network, but this approach was based on the premise that all enterprise users, data and applications resided on the corporate network. Traditional security approaches have limitations and security policies that are consistently applied within the traditional corporate network either cannot be enforced or are easily circumvented in a cloud environment. Cloud applications which are heavily used can also put significant strain on network capacity and data center infrastructure.Security appliances are expensive to purchase and maintain which has led to many organizations utilizing a limited number of internet gateways, routing traffic from branch offices across wide area networks through these gateways to apply security checks and access control, referred to as a “hub-and-spoke” architecture. The hub-and-spoke architecture is slow and provides a poor user experience which reduces the benefit of cloud deployment.Newer approaches route traffic directly to the internet and provide the functionality of a traditional internet gateway as a cloud service. A zero-trust approach is utilized where every user requires authentication for every application they access, providing increased security. Using the castle-and-moat approach users are given access to the corporate network instead of just the specific application they are utilizing which increases vulnerability because a single compromised VPN user can expose the entire corporate network.Cloud-based is the future of network security and the shift toward this approach has likely been accelerated by COVID-19 dramatically increasing the demands on corporate IT networks due to a proliferation of endpoints and traffic outside of the traditional corporate perimeter.Figure 1: Approaches to Network Security(Source: Created by author using data from Zscaler)In addition to the issues caused by cloud deployment, the sophistication and volume of cybersecurity threats continue to increase. Hackers, motivated by financial, criminal and terrorist objectives, are exploiting the gaps left by existing network security approaches with increasingly sophisticated and evolving threats.These factors have created a large and growing market opportunity for cloud-native network security solutions which can protect the corporate network and provide secure user access without impacting the user experience. Zscaler estimates that approximately $17.7 billion is spent annually on security functionality which is provided by its platform.Zscaler is a cloud-native cybersecurity company focused on connecting the right user to the right app on any network. Zscaler’s platform secures user access to applications and services utilizing a network of more than 100 data centers around the world, which allows traffic to be routed locally and securely to the internet.Zscaler’s cloud platform was designed to perform full in-line inspection of internet traffic and real-time threat correlation and delivers the functionality of a traditional internet gateway as a cloud service. This is achieved using a proprietary TCP/IP stack, which is protected by over 100 issued and pending patents. Zscaler’s value proposition is enhanced corporate security through improved network architecture and lower total cost of securing the corporate network. Cost reductions are achieved by eliminating the cost of buying and managing hardware and reducing dedicated wide area network costs.Zscaler’s primary services are:Figure 3: Zscaler Services(Source: Created by author using data from Zscaler)Revenue comes primarily from subscriptions to access the cloud platform along with related support services with a small amount of revenue generated by services associated with implementation, network design and training. Subscription pricing is calculated on a per-user basis and subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the contract, which is generally one to three years.Zscaler predominantly relies on a channel partner network to sell their platform, which includes telecommunications service providers, system integrators and value-added reseller partners. Service provider partners include BT Telecommunications (BT.A), Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGF), Orange (NYSE:ORAN) and Verizon (VZ). Systems integrator partners include, Deloitte and HCL America (HCLTECH). Zscaler’s sales team supports these channel partners by providing them with education, training and programs which enables them to sell Zscaler’s solutions independently. Zscaler’s sales force also directly develops relationships with customers and engages with senior IT personnel. This approach allows Zscaler to actively push their services with minimal sales staff and allows them to compete with much larger companies.Given the nature of Zscaler’s services and the scope of rerouting all internet traffic through Zscaler’s data centers, sales is a high touch and lengthy process and often involves C-level personnel in discussion of strategic network transformation and cloud migration projects. Zscaler’s sales and marketing expenses should therefore be expected to remain relatively high while the company is growing rapidly. As growth declines sales and marketing expenses should normalize as Zscaler’s services are likely to be sticky, with low customer churn and relatively long subscription periods.While most customers protect all users by routing all internet-bound traffic through Zscaler’s platform, some customers only deploy the platform for specific users or specific functionality. In these cases Zscaler can leverage a land-and-expand sales model and generate incremental revenue by:This strategy has proven effective so far with ARR expanding over time and contributing significantly to revenue growth.Figure 4: Zscaler ARR by Customer Cohort(Source: Zscaler)While Zscaler has yet to achieve operating profitably, the economics of its business is potentially compelling. Gross profit margins are high and the contribution margin of customers after the first year where sales and marketing expenses are elevated is also high. The contribution margin is defined as ARR minus the cost of revenue minus sales and marketing for the customer cohort and generally expands over time as ARR grows and sales and marketing expenses decline.Figure 5: Zscaler 2015 Customer Cohort Contribution Margin(Source: Zscaler)Zscaler plans to open its cloud security platform to third-party developers and applications to further extend its functionality in a strategic move similar to CrowdStrike’s (OTC:CRWD) store. Third-party solutions are likely to fulfill specific requirements and verticals that Zscaler has yet to introduce to the platform. While this may create additional competition, the focus for Zscaler is scaling the functionality of the platform rapidly and in a low-cost fashion to maximize its attractiveness to customers. This strategy could also be an additional monetization avenue if Zscaler decides to take a commission on revenue from applications sold through its platform.Zscaler still has significant potential for growth as only 200 of the Forbes Global 2000 were Zscaler customers in 2018. Zscaler currently has over 3,900 customers distributed across all major geographies and spanning every major industry, including airlines and transportation, conglomerates, consumer goods and retail, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media and communications, public sector and education, technology and telecommunications services.Zscaler has achieved relatively rapid revenue growth since it was incorporated in 2007, but this has begun to slow in the last 12 months. While revenue growth is still greater than 30% annually, the growth deceleration is concerning given Zscaler’s annual revenue is only approximately $360 million and they are targeting a $17 billion market. Investors should look for revenue growth to stabilize or increase in coming periods otherwise valuation multiples are likely to compress significantly.Figure 6: Zscaler Quarterly Revenue(Source: Created by author using data from Zscaler)Figure 7: Zscaler Revenue Growth(source: Created by author using data from Zscaler)The deceleration in revenue growth is supported by declining billings growth, which points to further potential revenue growth deceleration. Zscaler will likely receive a large revenue boost from COVID-19 forcing corporations to upgrade their network security solutions but the size of this boost is uncertain, as is the extent to which it will translate into long-term growth. The cost of Zscaler’s service is potentially an issue as it is priced on a per user basis. If a company has a large number of employees who are concentrated in a small number of locations, then traditional network security is likely to be comparable or less expensive which could be prohibiting adoption of Zscaler’s solution.Figure 8: Zscaler Revenue and Billings Growth(Source: Created by author using data from Zscaler)Zscaler continues to achieve strong growth in customers and revenue per customer which should support long-term growth. Expanding revenue per customer could be indicative of customer satisfaction with the platform leading to expanding deployment over time.Figure 9: Zscaler Customers(Source: Created by author using data from Zscaler)Figure 10: Zscaler Customer Net Retention Rate (Source: Created by author using data from Zscaler)Zscaler’s gross profit margins are high, even for an enterprise software company, which indicates a strong competitive position and places the company well for future profitability. Operating profit margins are negative, which is to be expected for a small SaaS company with high growth.Figure 11: Zscaler Margins(Source: Created by author using data from Zscaler)As the business scales and revenue declines, operating expenses will decrease relative to revenue and Zscaler should be able to achieve high operating margins. Zscaler’s operating expenses are slightly higher than comparable companies at a similar size but they are showing the same general trend. Operating expenses are dominated by sales and marketing, which is not surprising given the relatively long average subscription period and high-touch nature of the sales process.Figure 12: Zscaler Operating Expenses(Source: Created by author using data from Zscaler)Figure 13: Zscaler Operating Expenses(Source: Created by author using data from company reports)Despite not yet achieving operating profitability, Zscaler has generally generated positive free cash flows over the past few years. This is largely the result of stock-based compensation being a large contributor to total costs. Although this isn’t a cash cost it is a very real cost for existing shareholders in the form of dilution.Figure 14: Zscaler Free Cash Flow(Source: Created by author using data from Zscaler)Corporate network security is a well-established market with a number of strong global competitors. Zscaler’s successful entry into this market has been enabled by the transition to cloud computing and the new challenges it presents for network security. Zscaler segments its competition as follows:Competition is based on:Figure 15: Gartner Magic Quadrant for Secure Web Gateways (Source: Zscaler)Zscaler’s position as a cloud-native vendor gives it a strong position for the future as companies are transitioning to this style of network architecture. On-premise vendors have been aware of this transition for many years though and have been positioning themselves to compete in this market. Zscaler is now facing increased competition which makes its declining revenue and billings growth rates even more concerning.For example, Palo Alto Networks has a cloud solution that is similar to Zscaler’s, which it is strengthening through acquisitions. Palo Alto Networks’ billings show that its cloud service is similar in size to Zscaler but growing much faster. Palo Alto Networks aims to deliver a multi-cloud, multi-platform integrated security solution both for cloud security and new cloud-based network architectures. Palo Alto Networks already has a global footprint and is able to build on its existing relationships, potentially giving it an advantage in scaling adoption. In addition, it is able to offer an integrated suite of on-premise and cloud solutions which may enhance functionality and reduce costs for customers.Figure 16: Palo Alto Networks Customers(Source: Palo Alto Networks)Figure 17: Palo Alto Networks Next-Gen Security Billings (Source: Palo Alto Networks)Companies like Cloudflare are now introducing security solutions which place them increasingly in competition with Zscaler. Cloudflare can offer a range of network solutions and can provide better security in areas like DDoS mitigation. It is yet to be seen if Cloudflare will achieve widespread adoption amongst larger enterprises but they are a credible threat, particularly amongst smaller companies who may already be users of other Cloudflare services.Figure 18: Cybersecurity Market Landscape(Source: Created by author)Zscaler has a strong business with a large market opportunity and this is reflected in the stock’s rich valuation. Zscaler’s EV/S ratio is in line with its historical average since listing in 2018 but this is despite significant deceleration in growth.Figure 19: Zscaler EV/S Ratio(Source: Created by author using data from Zscaler and Yahoo Finance)Zscaler’s EV/S/growth ratio is at a historical high and shows how richly the company is currently valued given its growth rate. This is largely a function of the COVID-19 work-from-home narrative, but it is unknown how much the current situation will benefit Zscaler or how sustainable any additional revenue will be.Figure 20: Zscaler EV/S/growth Ratio (Source: Created by author using data from Zscaler and Yahoo Finance)There is a large premium for comparable companies that are cloud-native as they have strong competitive positions relative to on-premise incumbents and are achieving rapid revenue growth. Zscaler’s EV/S ratio is high for its current growth rate compared to companies like Okta (OKTA) and CrowdStrike. Companies like Fortinet and Palo Alto Networks trade on significantly lower multiples despite achieving growth rates not that much lower than Zscaler. This is at least partially due to the fact that their core firewall hardware businesses are likely to face pressure in the future as network security continues to change.Figure 21: Comparable Company EV/S Ratios(Source: Created by author using data from company reports and Yahoo Finance)Based on a discounted-cash-flow analysis, I estimate the intrinsic value of Zscaler to be approximately $83 per share. While I believe Zscaler is strongly positioned for the future and is fairly valued, I do not think this is a good entry point. Sentiment is high due to the COVID-19 work-from-home narrative and a failure to deliver significantly improved revenue growth in coming periods is likely to result in a share price decline. In addition, Zscaler faces strong competition and it is not clear it will remain the market leader in cloud network security."
4371724,102293,2020-08-31T12:41:45-04:00,"Cybersecurity has been one of the major beneficiaries of the work-from-home economy.Zscaler has demonstrated overall healthy financials and has increased its full-year guidance.Cheap capital can prove to be a major positive for Zscaler.The stock, however, is pretty expensive and is subject to price volatility.","The cloud-based information security company Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) has been reaching new heights for the past few months. Ironically, the pandemic caused the stock to plummet and touch its 52-week low of $35. However, the stock has not only recovered its losses, but has also jumped up 198.41% YTD to close at $141.13 on August 29.Although Zscaler has reaped the benefits of a superior product portfolio and brand recognition, the company is experiencing decreased growth rates in revenue and calculated billings. Macroeconomic instability and a lumpy sales cycle are some of the reasons for this decline. Then, there is also a higher prior-year base, which also affects growth rates. The company is overvalued and subject to high share price volatility.In this backdrop, while Zscaler can prove to be a good investment, it is also important that the price is in a reasonable range. I believe that retail investors should wait for a pullback to start with a small position in this stock.I will highlight how I came to adopt a neutral stance for this company in this article. First, we will see what is working in favor of Zscaler. Thereafter I will highlight the risks involved.The pandemic has resulted in accelerated digital transformation in all sectors. Companies are forced to adopt work-from-home and hybrid models to keep their businesses up and running. Since employees are working from outside the corporate network, traditional on-premise security has become redundant. The implementation of a remote workforce has resulted in increased cyber-risk for enterprises. Additionally, the threat landscape has dramatically broadened and is constantly evolving. In such a situation companies need to enable employees to work from anywhere securely. Hence, the increased operational risk associated with the digital economy has made cloud-based cybersecurity technologies particularly attractive.Zscaler estimates the total market opportunity for internet access and private access technologies to be $20.3 billion. The company's proprietary cloud-based applications are built for the current distributed-network environment. Hence, the company's cloud-based applications can prove far superior to legacy applications.Zscaler saw a healthy rise in total subscribers in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The company has a highly diversified customer base of over 3,900 customers across 185+ countries.We now see the company's existing and new customers increasingly adding new clients to the Zscaler ecosystem. This jump in the upsell activity is a direct result of multiple clients going digital and opting to include ZPA (Zscaler Private Access) service. However, there is a much bigger market to pursue considering that only 32% of the company's Global 2000 customers have purchased ZPA to date.The company has shown strong YOY growth for multiple fiscal years. The subscription model lends its high revenue visibility.Going beyond the business, let us take a look at the company's financial metrics.Zscaler reported revenue of $110.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which is a 9% sequential increase and a 40% YoY increase. The company's revenue is expected to grow 21.4%, faster than the U.S market which is expected to grow 9.7% and the industry which is expected to grow 12.1% in the next one to three years. However, although we are now working with higher bases, there is definitely some deceleration in YoY revenue growth trends.Zscaler has guided revenues in the range of $422 to $424 million indicating a 39% to 40% YOY growth. This is a slight improvement compared to the previous guidance of $414 to $417 million, which indicated a 37% to 38% YOY growth. The increased guidance is a show of confidence by the management of the company's continued growth.Zscaler reported the calculated billings of $131.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, indicating a 55% rise YOY. Like revenue, calculated billings are working on higher bases and are experiencing a deceleration in YOY growth trends.The calculated billings saw a considerable decline in the YOY growth rate for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2020 but significantly improved in the third quarter. Similarly, due to the strong third-quarter performance, the management raised the full-year guidance for calculated billings. The company expects the calculated billings to be in the range of $529 to $531 million, implying a YOY growth rate of 39% to 40%, again higher than the previous guidance of $512 to $517 million, implying a YOY growth rate of 37% to 38%. Increased guidance for calculated billings indicates that the company is expecting a surge in new customers and better cross-selling in the following quarters.Zscaler maintained a high dollar-based net retention rate for the third quarter. The company reported a 119% dollar-based retention rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. This compares well to 118% reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 116% last quarter. The increased retention rate can be attributed to the current COVID economy. Existing ZIA (Zscaler Internet Access) customers opted to include ZPA (Zscaler Private Access) service to their platform. Thus, increased cross-selling improved the dollar-based retention rate for the quarter.Zscaler has maintained a high non-GAAP gross margin YOY. The company reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 80% in the third quarter, 2 percentage points lower than the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Additionally, the company expects gross margin to be in the range of 76% to 77% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and 78% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. This decline in the gross margin is primarily due to the increased traffic for the company's ZPA (Zscaler Private Access) service. To meet this increased demand, the company is using AWS and Azure which runs at a significantly higher cost compared to their own data centers. However, the company expects its gross margins to return to 80% by the end of the second half of fiscal 2021.Zscaler has reported positive non-GAAP EPS of $0.07, beating the consensus by $0.05. However, according to the analysis done by Simply Wall St., the company is expected to remain unprofitable for the next one to three years.The company has increased its R&D expenditure by 20% sequentially and 39% YOY to $17.1 million. Increased R&D in higher levels of technology can directly boost the company's growth in future quarters.Zscaler has reported a positive cash flow of $9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The company's cash and short-term investments have grown to $391 million while the company has a total debt of $40.85 million as of 30th June 2020.However, the company has announced convertible senior unsecured notes offering worth $1 billion priced at 0.125%, due July 1, 2025. Although the new offering would significantly increase the company's overall debt, one should note that the interest charged on this borrowed money is negligible. The money comes at exceptionally low risk for the company and hence is lucrative. This offering will allow the company to invest even more into its business and ensure more growth.To wrap it up, the overall financial performance appears to be significantly strong for the company. The revenue and the calculated billings YOY growth rates have shown a slight decline, but nothing too alarming. Particularly, management seems positive to attain higher growth in future quarters.Zscaler is trading at a remarkably high P/S multiple of over 45x and a P/B ratio of over 50x and hence is exposed to significant share price volatility.According to the analysis done by Simply Wall St., the stock is 53.2% overvalued compared to the fair value that it has estimated. The fair value estimate is based upon the cash flows the company is expected to generate in the future. This analysis makes it clear that in the case of market correction, the stock will lose a considerable amount of its gains.Similarly, according to the analysis done by Seeking Alpha, the stock would experience a reduction in the forward P/S multiples in consequent years. This analysis is based on multiple analysts' projections for the company. Seeking Alpha estimates that forward P/S multiple for the stock will reduce to 30x with average sales of $556.56 million in fiscal 2021 and 24x with average sales of $710.43 million in fiscal 2022.Thus, we can assume that the stock price is more likely to go down in the future aftermarket correction. However, investors seem highly reluctant to adjust to this reality.Zscaler is highly favored by multiple Wall Street analysts. Most notably Citi analyst Walter Pritchard has upgraded the company from neutral to buy with a price target of $152 from $86 on July 9th. Similarly, the analyst from Morgan Stanley Keith Weiss upgraded the stock from underweight to equal weight with a price target of $104 on June 18th.So overall we can see that analysts are very bullish for the stock and expect good results from the company in ensuing quartersTo sum it up, Zscaler has outperformed consensus expectations in most of its quarters. It has shown a progressive growth in revenue and maintained high revenue visibility. Although the company is expecting a decline in the growth rates of annual revenue and calculated billings for the current fiscal year, it is not a matter of concern as the management is confident of its future growth. However, the concerning issue is that the company is overvalued. This valuation is making the stock very volatile and investors are subjected to higher risk.So, in my opinion, retail investors should wait for a pullback from Zscaler and take a position when the stock is reasonably valued with a time frame of at least one year."
4338566,103480,2020-04-20T12:47:33-04:00,"Zscaler's shares have surged ~45% so far in the year-to-date, making up for massive losses in the stock in the back half of 2019.Zscaler hasn't yet solved its fundamental problem: a deceleration in billings growth, to just 18% y/y in the most recent quarter.Investors may be banking on work-from-home trends to drive increased need for cloud security, but the stock is pricing in too much enthusiasm amid uncertainty.Zscaler looks excessively valued at ~18x forward revenues.","This article was highlighted for PRO subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.We live in a changed world, at least for the time being. Restaurants, stores, and offices are shut down across the country, and as millions of workers file for unemployment benefits, millions of others are logging into work remotely from home, sometimes for the first time. The internet and cloud services have made possible a near-total migration of the workplace into our homes, and investors have made huge bets that the technology companies supporting remote work will see large lifts in demand.Zscaler (ZS) is one of the high-profile recent IPOs expected to benefit from this trend. Battered toward the tail end of last year for a sharp slowdown in billings, investors are seeing opportunity in the current remote-work environment for Zscaler to redeem its growth and dramatically expand its market share amid heightened public discourse over security, especially with the recent trend of ""ZoomBombing."" Shares of Zscaler are up a dizzying ~45% in the year-to-date, defying a double-digit loss in the broader markets:Data by YChartsYet in trying to justify Zscaler's massive rebound this year, we have to ask ourselves several critical questions:In my view, Zscaler's rally has already run too far. While still acknowledging that Zscaler is a great product that was designed for the cloud and has won multiple consecutive years of top Gartner recognition, it's difficult to justify the company's valuation amid a still-bruised stock market.Let's start with the principal problem with investing in Zscaler: it's simply too expensive. Zscaler's towering valuation and the hyped-up expectations that came with it was one of the principal reasons why the stock crumbled from above $88+ last year when Zscaler's growth rates came down from the ~50% rates that investors were used to at the time of IPO to around ~30% y/y, which is more in-line with other growth software stocks.But now, Zscaler's growth rates have gotten only worse, at least as of the end of the second fiscal quarter ending in January. Consider this: Zscaler's revenues in Q2 grew at 36% y/y to $101.3 million, marginally winning out over Wall Street's expectations of $99.0 million. However, Zscaler's billings flashed some warning signs.Figure 1. Zscaler billings trendsSource: Zscaler Q2 earnings releaseAs shown in the table above, Zscaler only grew its calculated billings by a weak 18% y/y to $135.4 million, decelerating nineteen points from Q1 billings growth of 37% y/y. As most software investors are aware, billings growth is the best forward-looking indicator of future revenue growth, as it represents the value of the deals that Zscaler has signed and will recognize as revenue in future quarters. Put another way, Zscaler's mid-30s revenue growth doesn't take into account the fact that the company isn't building up sufficient deferred revenue balances to grow at similar rates in the future.Now, Jay Chaudhry did note that the company had a tough prior-year compare from 2Q19, citing a non-recurring private cloud sale to a ""large public sector customer last year."" Excluding this deal, billings growth would have been 30% y/y - but even so, that represents seven points of deceleration, and raises the question of whether Zscaler depends on large, lumpy deals.The company is squarely focused on execution for 2020, initiating a large increase in its sales headcount. Per Chaudhry's remarks on the Q2 earnings call:We can read the ramp-up in sales hiring as either well-timed or poorly timed. On the one hand, if Zscaler truly does see a surge in customer interest thanks to remote work arrangements, it's good that the company has more sales capacity in place. But even so, with global travel limited and many larger companies likely delaying purchases and installations of new software, a heavier headcount is unlikely to be efficient and may only result in deeper costs.Despite the risks of a billings slowdown and faulty sales execution, investors have already priced in a rebound in Zscaler's performance. At present share prices near $68, Zscaler trades at a market cap of $8.80 billion. It's also still up ~4x from its March 2018 IPO at a mere $16 per share. After we net off the $384.9 million of cash on Zscaler's balance sheet, we're left with an enterprise value of $8.41 billion.Over the trailing twelve months, Zscaler has generated $360.1 million in revenue. If we generously assume that Zscaler can keep up a ~30% y/y growth rate over the next twelve months (which is very aggressive consider its most recent billings growth rate was 18% y/y, or only 30% y/y excluding the one-time public sector comp), we arrive at a forward revenue estimate of $468.1 million. This puts Zscaler's current valuation at 18.0x EV/forward estimated revenues. That's a good deal more than where many other high-growth SaaS companies are currently trading. Companies like Alteryx (AYX), Avalara (AVLR), and Elastic (ESTC), which have similar or better growth rates, can be had for substantially cheaper value:Data by YChartsConsidering that we're already relying on aggressive assumptions that the shelter-in-place order will drive accelerating revenue/billings growth for Zscaler, I'd say any outperformance for Zscaler is already priced in. We should also note that Zscaler doesn't exist in a vacuum, and a surge in interest for security products could also easily see deals pass to legacy competitors like Cisco (CSCO) and Symantec (SYMC).There's a secondary problem with Zscaler as well. Right now, investors are prizing safety and profitability above growth in the stock market, which has made large-caps and safe havens outperform over the past month.Zscaler's profitability story, on the other hand, has seen dubious trends as of late. In Zscaler's most recent quarter, pro forma operating margins slipped from 13% in 2Q19 to 11% in 2Q20. Note that there's no light at the end of the tunnel for this weak trend: if Zscaler truly does plan on continuing with its plan of increasing its sales headcount by ~60% y/y this year amid a baseline revenue growth trend of ~200-30% y/y, its operating margins can only continue to decline.Figure 2. Zscaler operating margin trendsSource: Zscaler Q2 earnings releaseThe free cash flow story may even be worse. Though Zscaler had previously managed to produce positive free cash flow in the second quarter, that slipped slightly negative in 2Q20, as shown in the table below. In the first half of FY20, Zscaler's FCF has slipped by -57% y/y, while free cash flow margins have crumbled nine points. The company cited some one-time headquarters renovations as part of the driver of increased capex this year, but even the underlying operating cash flow trend is approximately flat despite a 42% y/y growth in revenue across the same period, suggesting overall efficiency is down:Figure 3. Zscaler free cash flow trendsSource: Zscaler Q2 earnings releaseThe one saving grace that Zscaler can claim is its strong balance sheet, which, to the company's credit, is a strong distinguisher in this jittery market. Zscaler has kept its balance sheet free of debt, even when convertible debt issuances have become massively popular in other mid-cap software companies around Zscaler's size.The roughly $385 million of debt-free cash on Zscaler's balance sheet is significantly larger than its most recent quarterly cash operating expenses of ~$72.5 million (opex less stock-based comp, depreciation and amortization, and a one-time litigation payment), suggesting Zscaler has plenty of liquidity to navigate through the difficult macro landscape.Figure 4. Zscaler balance sheetSource: Zscaler Q2 earnings releaseAll in all, however, Zscaler's declining margins will be another black eye for a company that is also seeing decelerating growth rates.I find it difficult to justify Zscaler's ~18x forward revenue valuation, no matter how much incremental growth we assume that the coronavirus can provide for Zscaler. I'm wary of buying high-flying names with questionable fundamental trends amid these choppy markets, and investors would do well to avoid purchasing this stock until prices come down again."
4334826,102101,2020-03-29T14:36:20-04:00,The market barely budged to the record jobless claims as the ~$2T emergency relief package comes to the rescue.Zscaler has shaken off its weaknesses to ride a new wave powered by fresh catalysts that will propel cloud security players.Investors have largely baked in the projected gains and late entrants should remain wary of buying into the overvaluation territory.,"Amidst the COVID-19 induced panic, investors keep sorting through stacks of tech equities to recalibrate their portfolio and possibly add companies whic are in great shape to survive a possible recession. Like its cybersecurity counterparts, Zscaler (ZS) hasn't been spared in the market volatility that has ensued as VaR shocks trigger stop losses across asset classes. For investors who are in doubt about the potential of Zscaler, the answer is simple: Zscaler will win; however, the win will come at a huge sacrifice. This means you should demand a huge risk premium.Demand for Zscaler’s offerings will play a more significant role in its valuation in addition to its cash flow dynamics and financial leverage. My previous thesis on CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD) highlighted the net positive effect of COVID-19 to top endpoint players. While I tried to sort through the top players, I left out Zscaler and its role in the future of digital transformation. My initial hypothesis was that enterprises that are jostling to protect remote endpoint devices want to snap up endpoint platforms like CrowdStrike and BlackBerry/Cylance (BB). However, that's just one approach to securing endpoints, data, and networks. After SA contributor Harris highlighted the partnership between Zscaler and CrowdStrike, I took more interest in Zscaler after realizing it is equally as formidable as CrowdStrike in acquiring more market share as companies go remote.My approach to infosec has always been to protect devices and networks. However, the proliferation of data and apps means security can be approached differently. Zscaler's offerings are structured to protect access to cloud networks and apps, which means by serving as a web proxy, CASB, or VPN; it can inspect communication between a remote device and a network or cloud infrastructure. This means we can either choose to protect all endpoints or protect access to critical business infrastructure when setting up a remote network. Better still, you want to protect both. Though, I expect an endpoint security solution to have the capabilities to protect devices at rest, in transit, data at rest, and data in transit.In an environment in which SMBs and large enterprises will grow increasingly tightfisted due to market uncertainty, I don't think most companies will be deploying multiple security solutions. Though, at some point down the line, they all have to follow cybersecurity best practices. This austere financial environment naturally favors cloud and endpoint security solutions as IPs are mostly stored in cloud platforms and accessed via endpoints.Going forward, the wave of cybersecurity attacks are expected to increase due to the growth of internet traffic and data in transit bouncing across multiple internet nodes, networks, and devices.FireEye (FEYE) recently published a report to confirm a spike in nation-state attacks.While the rise of ransomware attacks will also favor the adoption of endpoint security solutions, the cloud-centric network topology of most businesses will make it easy for Zscaler to make its case. In Gartner's latest magic quadrant for secure web gateways, Zscaler and Symantec are the leaders. So I expect Zscaler to continue to compete strongly in top access security RFPs. Zscaler recently beefed up its sales leadership, indicating its preparedness for the task ahead.Zscaler has typically had the opportunity to gain a lot of wins during refresh cycles when companies choose to do away with their hardware appliances for more nimble cloud security deployments. Right now, any refresh will favor Zscaler if it can offer a cheaper and easy to deploy solution. However, winning those product refresh cycles won't come as easily as anticipated. This has spurred a gradual revenue growth decline and lower than expected forward revenue guide. The Street has a 29% revenue growth estimate for 2021. This is based on the assumption that Zscaler will continue to succeed in its push to drive the adoption of its zero-trust network access approach to security. This isn't the only security deployment approach; however, it is one of the most compelling and adaptive to the cloud-centric nature of enterprise networks. This means opex will continue to be on the high side, and the recent sales events further solidify my conviction that Zscaler is spending to rewrite the security adoption narrative in favor of its approach. For this growth strategy to be successful, Zscaler needs to be lucky with the crop of talent it recruits. They either produce a performance akin to what the kick-ass sales team at Palo Alto (PANW) produced between 2016 and 2019, or the music stops before we know it. DBNER further decelerated last quarter, which means the task ahead isn't going to be easy.This means valuation is not a bet on products (the products are great) but on sales to deliver on the forward growth guidance. As a result, I want to demand a huge risk premium when calibrating my valuation. This means not going beyond the upper boundary (40x) of its historical P/S multiple (currently 50% off high) or the peer average P/S ratio. This also means buying into weaknesses while sitting aside when the stock becomes frothy. Zscaler is already trading close to the average analysts' price target of $64, which means there is little bargain opportunity left. It’s tough to achieve what Palo Alto did in the past five years, though it's not impossible. However, at any FY 2021 P/S multiple above 10x, you want to tread with caution.Source: AuthorI see Zscaler making a strong case to help enterprises accelerate their digital transformation projects by provisioning them with its ZTNA approach to security. This will come at a huge capital cost, which means margins will continue to be sacrificed. Given its strong balance sheet, there is no reason to worry about the health of the business in the short term. Zscaler will win deals; however, investors need to be careful buying into the overvaluation territory.I'm grateful to commentators who have shaped my ideas and thoughts about cybersecurity over the years by making a great case to refine my competitor analysis approach as most cybersecurity vendors don't offer competing products. They mostly complement each other to ensure cybersecurity best practices. I want to point out that my methodology is borne out of my desire to try to predict who wins key RFPs before enterprises decide to double their security spend. Most companies still consider security as an afterthought. Given the rise of data privacy laws and regulations, most companies will no longer be able to get away with doing the barest minimum.While my approach isn't the best at informing the public about the need to adopt cybersecurity best practices, investors should note that the point of my competitor analysis is to pick who wins in the worst-case scenario assuming enterprises have little to no discretionary spend to commit to buying best of breed cybersecurity solutions. This optimizes for valuation not product adoption and it is important that readers note the difference."

It is entirely dependent on channel partners to sell its products.","I gave Zscaler, Inc. (ZS) a very bullish rating in my last article written back in September. Despite the bearish sentiment for most cybersecurity stocks since that time and the recent onset of the pandemic, Zscaler's stock has managed to outperform the S&p 500 by more than 40%.(Source: Seeking Alpha)Zscaler is perceived by many investors and analysts as a prime beneficiary of the transition to work-from-home as COVID-19 spreads, forcing many companies to adjust their way of doing business. Zscaler has two products that cater to increased cloud adoption and mobility: Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). The latter is considered to be an alternative to the widely used virtual private network (VPN). In addition to ZIA and ZPA, Zscaler is moving toward a new all-encompassing vision for cybersecurity called Secure Access Service Edge (SASE).(Source: Zscaler)I have some concerns regarding Zscaler's ability to capitalize on the seismic shift to the cloud despite the cloud-centric product-positioning. My concerns include:Given the above factors, I am downgrading my rating for Zscaler to neutral.Zscaler is considered to be a high-growth investment, justifying its high stock valuation. In July, its TTM sales growth peaked at 60% but has been in decline ever since. In February, Zscaler reported 2020 Q2 revenue growth of 36% and billings growth of only 18%.(Source: Portfolio123)The management has indicated that they had a difficult comparison against Q2'19 which was aided by nonrecurring revenue from a large customer. Excluding that specific revenue source, revenue growth was 41% and calculated billings growth was 30%, still down fairly significantly in what was supposed to be one of the strong quarters.The company management is treating the reduced performance as a sales execution issue that is being solved by bolstering its sales force:One area that I am concerned about is Zscaler's sales model which consists almost entirely of channel partners. 98% of the revenue comes through such partners.(Source: Zscaler)There are several issues here. From a sales perspective, Zscaler is completely dependent upon its partners, which are not exclusive relationships. Channel partners may decide to sell the competition's products if they are perceived to be superior or the channel partner can make more money.At present, Zscaler has a high concentration of business with a few partners which is a pretty significant risk.(Source: Zscaler)I also don't understand Zscaler's ramp-up of its sales force. It is more-or-less pushing on a rope. Adding more salespeople probably isn't going to convince channel partners to sell more product. The root cause of Zscaler's sales execution issues likely has more to do with competition and product positioning.Finally, in this unique situation where companies are reaching for immediate solutions for the work-from-home mandate, it would probably be more beneficial for companies like Zscaler to have a direct sales force. Using channel partners puts the company at a distance from the customer C-suites that will be making fast decisions.I assess a company's cash burn by examining the SG&A expense relative to sales. In the case of Zscaler, I find the SG&A expense margin of 91% to be quite high, considering that the company sells entirely via channel partners.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)91% of revenue intake is being spent on SG&A expenses (plus R&D). This figure is likely to go up during the remainder of the year if the company makes good on its promise to increase its sales force by 60%. In addition to rising SG&A, I expect revenue growth will be tempered due to the impending global recession which will put further pressure on margins.The following scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth illustrates Zscaler's stock valuation relative to the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red on the scatter plot and represents a typical valuation based on next year's sales growth. As can be seen from the scatter plot, Zscaler is situated well above the best-fit line and, in fact, has one of the highest EV/forward sales multiples of all the stocks that I track. This suggests to me that the company is quite overvalued at present. If Zscaler continues to have sales execution issues, then I expect that the stock price will show significant declines as it has in the past two quarters.The company management assumes that the sales execution issues can be fixed by bolstering the sales staff, adding regional VPs, and getting a better handle on the sales pipeline. But it is possible that the declining revenue growth is a result of increased competition.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) announced that billings for its next-generation security product are expected to grow 79% to 82% YoY. Palo Alto has a SASE platform called Prisma. CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD), which should benefit from the work-from-home movement due to its endpoint protection products, has guided for a ""conservative"" 50+% revenue growth this year. There are other competitors such as Cloudflare (NET) with revenue growth of 50% among others.On the surface, it appears that Zscaler may be having issues beyond what can be fixed by an improved sales force.On the surface, it appears that Zscaler should be a prime beneficiary of the very urgent work-from-home movement. Investors certainly believe this is the case, as Zscaler's stock is bucking the downward trend of the stock market during this COVID-19 scare. While I am sure there will be some benefit to Zscaler's revenue, I have concerns about the company's ongoing sales execution issues and how they are being addressed, the company's high level of cash burn in the face of an imminent global recession, and the high stock valuation based on forward sales multiple. For these reasons, I am giving Zscaler a neutral rating."

4335769,41961,2020-04-03T00:45:47-04:00,Zscaler is a cloud-first network security platform with distinct product advantages over competitors.Secular trends such as mobile workers and increasing cloud application access serve to act as powerful tailwinds for the business.The coronavirus pandemic will serve to accelerate CIO adoption in a way that no company marketing can.,"Zscaler (ZS) provides security as a service for enterprise networks, cloud-related applications and platforms. The business has a market capitalization of just over $7.8 billion and delivered $300 million in revenue in 2019. It has delivered at 300% return since listing in 2018.Addresses a critical enterprise need of network-level securityZscaler provides a multi-tenant security platform that offers security capabilities traditionally delivered as purpose-built appliances. What’s unique about the Zscaler solution is that the business is leveraging a distributed cloud to provide a security platform that’s purpose-built for the way that cloud computing is delivered. The business provides network security capabilities such as cloud firewalls, data leak prevention as well as more application-centric security, which includes malware detection and application control.With the growing usage of cloud-based application and software and the increase in connected endpoints throughout an enterprise, a cloud-based security framework of the type that is offered by Zscaler is something that is seeing increasing demand within enterprises as CTOs scramble to get their hands on the increasing number of threats which are being introduced into the enterprise with the surge in cloud-based offerings.Stickiness comes from being core to enterprise architectureZscaler, or any enterprise network security protocol, requires a re-architecture of security protocols and processes to incorporate network-level security. Traffic authentication needs to be systematically done before entry into an enterprise network, and so, routing of traffic will need to take place in such a way as to allow traffic inspection. Once implemented, enterprises are loath to disrupt the cyber safeguards that are now in place to protect the network, to then turn around and adopt a new solution.This inertia becomes magnified as the number of the endpoints within an enterprise increase and the size of the network to be protected and the number of cloud instances to be secured expand over time. This high degree of customer stickiness and mission-critical nature of the product that Zscaler provides are not only in reflected in the retention of existing customers and strong addition and growth of new customers, but also in the company's dollar retention rate, which is close to 120%, indicating that existing customers are spending close to 20% more with the company each year.Strongly leveraged to secular trendsThe increasing shift to software as a service and the public cloud has resulted in an increasing number of cloud-delivered applications for critical systems and processes within an enterprise. Cloud-based infrastructure and application delivery is a trend that is only going to accelerate as more enterprises gain an increasing awareness of the scalability, cost advantages and maintenance benefits that cloud-delivered infrastructure and applications provide.In particular, the delivery of enterprise productivity applications such as Microsoft Office 365 (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) via the cloud will increase the amount of Internet traffic and workloads and pathways that open to the Internet that an enterprise will be required to secure and protect. Traditional security solutions such as Palo Alto Networks (PANW) which were architected via individual appliances may struggle with scalability and processing power to be able to manage such a volume of connections and traffic that will need to be inspected once there is broader adoption of cloud-based software.When coupled with an expected rapid increase in wireless mobility of employees accessing enterprise services from remote devices as well as the likely plethora of Internet-connected devices which will soon make their way onto corporate networks, there is a broad convergence in a number of trends, all of which will increase demand and the need for Zscaler's cloud security offerings.Coronavirus TailwindThe coronavirus epidemic should act as a nice tailwind for Zscaler and act as a natural accelerant to its business momentum in a more effective way than even its own marketing could likely convey. The remote work environment that the coronavirus pandemic has created will help accelerate many natural, organic trends that were already taking shape and help further magnify these. Enterprises will no doubt look to accelerate cloud access to many of the software services that they already consume, to simply ensure easier accessibility as part of their own contingency planning.Further, with an explosion of new external connections into enterprise networks that is taking place at present, and likely into the future, there is an exponential increase in threat vectors occurring into the enterprises that Zscaler sells into, at a capacity that will likely start to test legacy purpose-built appliances like Palo Alto Networks. The coronavirus may end up serving up a better business case for Zscaler than even its marketing department is able to develop.Zscaler is still very much focused today on the land grab for market share within the enterprise. Roughly 30% of the Fortune 500 are Zscaler’s customers today; however, the business is in an arms race for broader penetration, fighting an aggressive battle against incumbent security vendors and networking vendors such as Palo Alto Networks and Cisco (CSCO) to gain enterprise main share.This competitive battle with legacy incumbents bears watching out. While Zscaler's product is the only ""cloud-first"" cybersecurity solution that has been architected, there is significant noise from incumbent vendors concerned with the company's sharp market share acquisition. The muddied technical claims of competitive providers who are better-resourced and capitalized than Zscaler may serve to create confusion and elongate scale cycles, which may slow Zscaler's growth.Given the active land grab that is taking place in the cybersecurity market, Zscaler is not currently optimizing for operating profitability, but rather, market share and revenue growth are the company's top priorities. It has successfully grown revenues at a rate of 55% annualized over the last three years. The company has also progressively improved both gross and operating margins, with gross margins improving from 73% in 2015 to over 80% in 2019 and operating margins also showing a similar rate of improvement over the last five years.Another aspect of some concern with Zscaler is its lofty valuation. The company is currently trading at 21x revenues, even though it is still down almost 33% from all-time highs reached last year. If current market volatility continues which happens to hit Zscaler's share price, this could certainly be a business for long-term growth-oriented investors to consider."

Is there more to the problem? Could Zscaler be ""stuck in the chasm""? Is competition striking back?Research by McKinsey emphasizes the importance of maintaining high revenue growth for successful tech-companies: ""Grow fast or die slow"".Zscaler's story is not broken yet but recent developments are alarming. Holding and buying shares require a bit of a leap of faith.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.When I first wrote about Zscaler (ZS) a bit more than a year ago I had a clear investment thesis:Zscaler was seeing explosive and accelerating revenue growth while also showing great profit margin potential. At the same time, the company seemed to have major long-term tailwinds from its disruptive approach to cybersecurity. Their competitive advantage as a first mover and market leader indicated a very long runway of growth.At the time of my article (in December 2018), Zscaler was trading around $40 a share and had just come out of a quarter (Q1 2019) growing revenue at 59%, billings at 55% and deferred revenue at 68%.Subsequent quarters showed an acceleration of revenue growth to 65% (Q2 2019) and 61% (Q3 2019) which catapulted the shares to an all-time high around $88 a share in late July 2019.Since then Zscaler was hit by a combination of broader market turbulences in the Cloud/SaaS-space (which has already abated but seems to be picking up steam again as I write this) and weakness in business performance. What started with the company admitting to lengthening sales cycles in Q4 2019, culminated in the recent Q2 2020 earnings report where the company reported year-on-year revenue growth of only 36% and billings growth of 18%.This steep deceleration in top-line growth metrics needs further discussion. Should investors be patient and wait this out or move on?If you read or listen to the opening statements of the recent conference call without knowing the numbers and their context you might be surprised to see the stock drop more than 15%. CEO Jay Chaudhry started the call saying:I must admit this start stunned me a bit since there were not too many ""solid"" or ""tremendous"" aspects of the report in my opinion. Zscaler should hold itself to different standards and it is obvious that they are not performing according to expectations at the moment.I don't want to create the impression that Zscaler's management is not aware of the fact that there is a problem. Sales problems combined with some comparability issues related to one-time billings and sales in the previous year have been identified as reasons for the recent trend of decelerating growth. Management was quick to point out that they are working hard on solving sales execution issues and that they are already seeing many improvements. In fact, these topics took up most of the time at the conference (which will be discussed a bit more later).However, this is not really the main issue that is concerning to me as an investor. As the famous saying goes, it ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.What if management is focusing too much on sales execution issues when the problem might lie elsewhere? Even worse, what if there is a problem they can do nothing about?In my last article on Alteryx (AYX) I argued that having the best product is rarely the only reason for market success: you need superior sales & marketing execution (which Zscaler is admittedly struggling with) and you also have to get the timing right (which is normally out of your control).The problem is this: Yes, Zscaler might have the right architecture and the best product. They might also overcome their sales issues. But what if their product is simply too disruptive to gain mainstream adoption in the enterprise? Or, conversely, what if the (perceived) additional value of Zscaler's cloud products does not justify a fundamental change of the cybersecurity architecture? What if hybrid cloud solutions provided by ""legacy"" cybersecurity providers like Palo Alto (PANW) are ""good"" enough for most clients? What if competitors like Cloudflare (NET), who seems to be selling very similar solutions to Zscaler, are heating up the competitive battle?How do you reconcile the idea that Zscaler is disrupting the industry when they just posted quarterly billings growth of 18% while still being a relatively small company with revenues of less than half a billion dollars?Zscaler had a great use case example of GE who completely changed its security infrastructure. Analyzing that use case, it was easy to imagine Zscaler landing similar customers; large customers who are willing to abandon their network architecture for something entirely new and better. The story looks great, but do the numbers still fit?Source: Author's table (numbers from Zscaler's earnings press releases). Q3 2020 and full-year numbers are based on the high-end of guidance provided by management in Q2 2020.Zscaler has seen revenue growth declining since Q2 2019 when they hit a record growth rate of 65%. The 36% year-on-year growth rate achieved this quarter is by far the lowest number on deck. Both year-on-year and sequential growth numbers have seen notable declines.If you look at the absolute year-on-year and sequential dollar-additions (in millions), the picture doesn't look that bleak (but also not great):Source: Author's table.As you can see, the company added around $27 million in revenue in Q2 2020, which is the least since Q1 2019. They added $7.7 million sequentially, which is the second-highest sequential addition in the company's history but also cannot compare to the $11 million sequential dollar-additions achieved in Q2 2019.The takeaway here should be twofold:In my view, the issue of revenue growth has to be the main focus of investors right now. Decelerating revenue growth, especially for younger companies, is more often than not a harbinger of future problems. These could be that the addressable market is not as big as projected, that competition is causing troubles, or that there are internal issues.One way of looking at this problem of lacking revenue growth is through the framework of crossing or being stuck in ""the chasm"". Geoffrey A. Moore coined this term in his book Crossing the Chasm where he argues that there is a chasm (gap) between the early adopters of a product and the early majority (there are five main segments in the technology adoption lifecycle: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards). Crossing that chasm is the most difficult step in developing a high-tech market. It's when a company manages to transition from an early market dominated by a view visionary customers to a mainstream market dominated by pragmatists. If you cannot make that jump, you (or maybe better: your investors) might be in trouble.So, is a company that has seen growth slow from 65% to 36% in only one year stuck in the chasm? There is no easy answer. Analyzing if a company is crossing or stuck in the chasm is not exactly a science. After all, this is economics, not physics (even worse, it's marketing). There are no direct causalities that could be studied. The best you can do is to examine case studies, look for patterns and try to combine the dots based on experience. As such, it would be interesting to have a discussion on that topic in the comments section.One obvious pattern to indicate if a company has successfully crossed the chasm is sustaining a high growth rate until reaching a dominant market position. Conversely, slowing revenue growth is a very straight-forward symptom for being stuck.Luckily, there is some tangible research on the topic of the growth pace of high-tech companies. Consulting firm McKinsey & Company has even created a catchy phrase for the importance of growth in the high-tech space: Grow fast or die slow.There are some very interesting insights from the McKinsey-research. For example, there are several leading indicators of a coming revenue growth stall:Unfortunately, in the concrete case, we cannot answer if any of the indicators above are applicable to Zscaler. Management is only sharing the number of customers adds at the end of the fiscal year, so there is no concrete information if or how much customer acquisition is stalling (although, it is easy to deduct from the information at hand - slowing revenue and billings growth and a focus on larger deals with longer sales cycles - that Zscaler is not adding record numbers of customers at the moment). The other indicators are also hard to pin down. It is worth mentioning, though, that there haven't been any reports claiming that any of the indicators mentioned above are concerning Zscaler at the moment.However, there is a further (a bit more troubling) finding from the McKinsey research, and I will quote this because it is so important: ""Most interesting to us, companies whose growth rate fell off and then recovered created less than a quarter of the value of the companies that maintained growth - despite similar rates of growth at the $1 billion threshold. Taking their foot off the pedal for even a short stint had dramatic long-term consequences. Bankers call this the ""humpty dumpty"" problem: once growth is broken, it is impossible to put back together again."" (emphasis by the author)Thus, even if Zscaler manages to stabilize (or even reaccelerate) revenue growth, there is empirical evidence that future stock returns are already damaged by the recent deceleration.Furthermore, of the nearly 3,000 companies that McKinsey studied in 2014, only 28% reached $100 million in annual revenues; 3% got to $1 billion in annual sales, and just 0.6% (17 companies in total) grew beyond $4 billion. Will Zscaler be one of the lucky few?If you believe Zscaler's management, they definitely are. As already mentioned, they stated this very clearly in the conference call and tried to give investors confidence in their ability to turn sales execution around.Since I have no experience in sales operation I must admit that most of the comments regarding sales execution in the conference call - which took up the majority of the call - sounded a bit jibberish to me. It is impossible for me to evaluate if the steps taken are the right steps to take in the current situation and what outcome these efforts will have. It is clear, though, that management has taken steps to address sales issues.One tangible insight from the conference call was that sales cycles have not changed. Over time, Zscaler expects to see a shortening of sales cycles again, but currently, they are about the same: three to six months for smaller accounts and six to 12 months for larger accounts. Since the company is focusing more on larger deals, revenue recognition should be expected to be lumpy. Currently, Zscaler is seeing the negative effects of that lumpiness, as they haven't been able to close enough deals to keep growth numbers up. On the other hand, if sales initiatives are fruitful, closing a higher amount of larger deals in later quarters could also lead to the reacceleration of revenue growth.Since Zscaler sells transformational products it means that they have a top-down sales approach with the involvement of C level executives on the customers' side. Zscaler has always understood this process but acknowledged that they did not have proper discipline and structure and enablement to take their sales process at a large scale level. Since the new CRO (Chief Revenue Officer) Dali Rajic took over, Zscaler increased their ""sales enablement team"" from 2 to 15 people to address this issue.Zscaler's management also mentioned that the sales pipeline quality has seen significant improvement in terms of both volume and quality. As a result, the company is quite optimistic about the second half of FY 2020.It's important to note, though, that the current company guidance (top of the range) calls for 35% revenue growth in Q3 2020, 34% in Q4 2020 and 38% for the full year 2020. Thus, this optimism is not really expressed in the guidance numbers provided. Whoever hopes that Zscaler will quickly turn around their recent sales woes and return to accelerating growth will probably be disappointed.Also, important to note is that the company only just beat revenue guidance this quarter by a narrow 1.3%. As a comparison, they beat revenue guidance by 4% in Q1 2020, 3.7% in Q4 2019, and 5.5% in Q3 2019. This is also a worrying trend to acknowledge. While in FY 2019 investors could happily ignore the very prudent guidance given by management, FY 2020 is painting a quite different picture.What becomes clear is that the company wants investors to think they only have sales execution issues which can be - and actually already are - addressed. Management continues to insist that there are no competitive issues, that ""the market is coming to us"", and that they have the right architecture for the cloud (as opposed to competitors who claim to have the right architecture but actually don't have it).I'm not sure I'm buying that, though. Remember, Zscaler added $27 million of revenue year-over-year and $7.7 million sequentially in Q2 2020. Last year, they added $29.3 million year-over-year and $11 million sequentially. However, last year they had sales & marketing expenses of $38.8 million, while this year they spend $61.1 million. In other words, they spent 60% more to get worse results.Of course, some of that additional spending is related to the sales ramp up that will only show effects later. Also, the marketing expenses of a quarter are not directly contributing to revenue growth in the same quarter - there is always a certain lag, especially if sales cycles are longer. Still, it is a worrying fact to look at.One reason for my excitement about a Zscaler-investment when they came public was that they saw extremely high and accelerating top-line growth while showing a very clear path towards profitability. Currently, they are showing quickly decelerating top-line growth while profitability and cash flows are waning.The real investment story, however, was a story of disruption. Rethinking network security and providing a cheaper and better new paradigm of cybersecurity that supports increasing mobility of the global work-force. Current growth numbers tarnish the overall picture of that disruption story.Maybe Palo Alto was right when they claimed a couple of quarters ago that they are seeing competitive wins against Zscaler. At the time I interpreted that comment from Palo Alto as weakness and confirmation of the disruptive nature of Zscaler's product. Maybe I was wrong.A few days ago, Palo Alto reported rather disappointing earnings numbers. However, they also mentioned that ""billings for our Next-Generation Security offerings continued to perform very well. As customers progress on their journey to the cloud and elevate cybersecurity as an integral part of network transformations, Palo Alto Networks remains a trusted partner to organizations worldwide."" Next-Gen Security billings are expected to be in the range of $810 million to $820 million, representing year-over-year growth of 79% to 82%. So, Palo Alto is growing these offerings at a much higher pace at more than double the scale of Zscaler. Of course, you cannot compare Palo Alto's ""Next-Gen Security"" to Zscaler's products apples to apples. We don't know what these ""Next-Gen Security"" products comprise of concretely and how this growth is related to the cannibalization of other product lines within existing customers.But there are other companies like Cloudflare, which seem to have a lot of potential to compete with Zscaler. In the article I already linked above, it is stated that Cloudflare ""wants to replace corporate VPNs and firewalls with its own networks"". Sounds awfully similar to Zscaler, right? Well, it is. Netskope is another cloud-first cybersecurity company, which even got a mention in the conference call.This is not an attempt to analyze the competitive landscape of Zscaler in any detail or to suggest that these competitors are ""better"" than Zscaler. It's simply a recognition of the fact that while Zscaler might have a competitive advantage against legacy cybersecurity vendors like Palo Alto through their disruptive approach, their competitive advantage against other competitors with similar products - like Cloudflare and Netskope - is not as clear. For example, I thought that Zscaler had a competitive advantage through its 100 data centers around the globe - a clear scale advantage in my view that seemed hard to replicate. Well, it turns out Cloudflare has 200 of these data centers.Finally, there is valuation: As of this writing, the company has a TTM EV/S of around 18. Using a 35% growth rate for the next twelve months, the forward EV/S comes to 13.5. That is neither incredibly expensive nor particularly cheap.As a comparison, when I first wrote about Zscaler they were trading at a forward EV/S just below 18. However, I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that shares are a bargain because of this. Back then, the company was firing on all cylinders. Comparatively, I would even argue that the shares are more expensive now than a year ago - despite the lower EV/S multiple. One simply has to consider the current business outlook, especially the (justified) uncertainty about future growth.Data by YChartsAlso, compared to other software companies with similar 30%-40% revenue growth rates Zscaler doesn't look particularly cheap. Among the companies shown in the graph Zscaler is also the one with by far the lowest TTM revenue (the second largest among the group, HubSpot, has almost double the TTM revenue as Zscaler) and the steepest decline in quarterly revenue growth over the last quarters. Thus, it could be argued that, while shares of Zscaler have already fallen a long way from the top, they are still relatively overvalued because investors have been reluctant to adjust to the new fundamentals.Then again, it is not unreasonable to put a little faith in the company's management and believe that the current fundamental weakness is only temporary. Until now, management hasn't given investors any reason to distrust them, so you might as well give them some slack. Also, if you take the time to read some of the customer stories of Zscaler, and the kind of companies they were already able to onboard, it seems difficult to argue that they are currently ""stuck in the chasm"" - it appears that they have already jumped that gap some time ago. It also doesn't hurt that IT investing expert Bert Hochfeld seems to believe firmly in Zscaler's prospects.I still think there is a good chance that Zscaler's disruptive story is intact and that they can reaccelerate growth. However, there are problems in Zscaler's growth that simply cannot be ignored. At the least, they have to be monitored closely.I haven't decided yet if I will trim my position in Zscaler but it is likely; I'm probably going to hold some of the shares to keep them on my radar. I'm definitely not going to add shares because I generally try to avoid buying into company weakness. As I said in the introduction, holding and buying shares of Zscaler requires a bit of a leap of faith at the moment.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on my latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4340164,104608,2020-04-27T08:35:04-04:00,"Zscaler continues to remain a leader in internet security with demand likely surging given the transition to work-from-home models.
        Underlying billings growth and margin trends remain under pressure and could present headwinds to the company.
        Valuation has become a bit concerning at ~18x forward revenue using my normal-case scenario.","Given the rapid change in economic conditions, enterprises and people have adapted to living and working from home, something we would have thought as nearly impossible only a few months ago. The clear beneficiaries of this work-from-home trend are technology and cloud-based companies that have made this migration as seamless as possible.Zscaler (ZS) is one of these companies who have benefitted from significantly increased demand related to internet security. As companies move their employees to a work-from-home model, internet security has become increasingly more important. The increased demand will surely accelerate the company’s revenue growth and expand their market share, however, investors should still be cautious around investing in high-valuation names.While the company continues to have a significant opportunity to disrupt the cloud-based security market, valuation has risen over the past few months as the stock has gone up over 40% year-to-date. While investors are riding the bullish train on companies benefitting from the work-from-home transition, valuation should still be a concern for long-term holders.Historically speaking, ZS has consistently beat their quarterly expectations and investors have become accustomed to big revenue beat and raises. Even if ZS does not continue to provide guidance metrics given the significant uncertainty around the global pandemic, investors are likely to expect heightened growth patterns for at least the next several quarters.One of the biggest questions is whether or not ZS will be able to execute on this heightened demand patterns and at what point do things normalize, thus potentially deflating the company’s valuation multiple. Competitors are also experiencing increased demand and there could eventually been a shake-out among leaders of the group. I believe ZS could become a clear leader of internet security, though as these price levels, I am a little more cautious around putting money into the name.Revenue during the quarter grew 36% to $101.3 million, which was only ~$2 million ahead of expectations for ~$99 million. Revenue growth did however decelerate from the 48% seen in Q1, which could partially be a factor of the law of large numbers. Even more challenging is the company’s billings, which grew only 18% during the quarter, down from the 37% growth seen last quarter.Source: Company PresentationBillings are known for being a good indicator of future revenue growth as they represent deals the company has won but has not yet converted into revenue. With billings growth decelerating to only 18% growth, the underlying trends in the business may have started to slow down. These figures are somewhat irrelevant today because of the large demand spike caused by the work-from-home trend. However, once demand starts to normalize, investors will have a heightened awareness of billings growth trends.Operating margins were a little weak, coming in at 11% during the quarter, down from 13% in the year ago period. Over time, investors are expecting margins to expand as the company gains scale and is better able to leverage their operating expense base. However, in the near-term, it seems like the company is sacrificing some of their margins for continued strong growth. With the company planning on expanding their sales headcount during this year, operating margins are likely to remain under pressure during the near-term.Source: Company PresentationThe company also provided updated guidance which includes full-year revenue of $414-417 million, up from their previous guidance range of $405-413 million. Billings were also raised to $512-517 million, up from $500-510 million. However, given the significant change in demand over the past few weeks, investors should not place a lot of weighting on their current guidance.Given the 40%+ year-to-date performance, valuation has increased as well. I believe ZS remains a great position to have in a long-term portfolio, however, investors should be aware of a few items before making an investment.First, the company’s billings growth seems to be slowly decelerating prior to the global pandemic caused enterprises to transition to work-from-home models. The increased demand could last for several quarters, and potentially longer if working-from-home becomes a long-term trend. Second, margins have remained under pressure, though the company is investing heavily into their workforce. Finally, valuation, the stock’s valuation has increased significantly and is now a bit of a risk to the nameUsing TTM revenue for ZS of ~$360 million, we can start to generate different potential outcomes related to growth and valuation. With a current market cap of ~$8.7 billion and net cash of ~$400 million, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$8.3 billion.First, let’s assume growth trends accelerate from the current ~30% rate and grow ~40% over the next year. This could result in revenue of ~$500 million, which implies a current valuation of ~16.6x forward revenue. While this multiple doesn’t seem too expensive, we are also assume revenue growth accelerates quite significantly over the next year.Next, let’s assume the growth rate remains pretty stable at ~30%, which would imply revenue of ~$470 million and imply a revenue multiple of ~17.7x, a somewhat expensive premium to pay for a company who has seen margin pressure and cash flow challenges.Finally, let’s assume revenue growth slows down as competition increases and the work-from-home trend is short-lived. While I believe this is unlikely, if revenue were to grow only ~20%, similar to their recent billings growth, we could see revenue of ~$430 million, which would imply a loft forward revenue valuation of ~19.3x. Investors who are skeptical of the next 12 months of revenue growth are surely to be scared away from a near 20x forward revenue multiple.Even though ZS is likely to be a beneficiary from the global pandemic, I am hesitant to put new money to work given the current valuation is already baking in strong revenue growth over the next year. My concerns over underlying billings growth and margin trajectory outweigh my optimism that revenue growth will meaningfully accelerate, thus implying a more reasonable forward revenue valuation.The valuation chart above does a good job demonstrating several other software and cloud-based technology names that have 20%+ revenue growth and trade at a much more reasonable forward revenue valuation. While I remain a long-term bull of ZS given their leadership position in internet security, I remain on the sidelines for now until we are better able to understand medium-term revenue growth and margin trajectory.Risks to the name include a continued slowdown in billings growth as new sales may be more challenged given the stay at home order many states and countries are currently under. This may make future revenue growth lumpier as larger contracts may become more common. Other risks include increased competition from legacy vendors who are also likely experience increase in demand given the shift to work-from-home. The high forward revenue valuation also poses a risk as investors are typically harsher on growth names when the market goes through a correction phase."
4316193,104608,2020-01-10T12:02:00-05:00,"Zscaler reported Q1 revenue growth of 48%, which came in well above expectations.
        Management raised full year revenue by ~$9 million at the midpoint, greater than the ~$4 million revenue beat during the quarter.
        Valuation remains at a premium at ~15x forward revenue, though somewhat attractive at ~11x FY21 revenue considering 35%+ revenue growth.","After reporting a good Q1 earnings report, Zscaler (ZS) initially saw their stock go down ~15% in the days following. However, investors quickly saw this as a buying opportunity and have pushed the stock back up to pre-Q1 earnings levels. The company continues to have a significant opportunity to disrupt the cloud-based security market and despite the premium valuation, this should be a name owned in almost all long-term portfolios.Q1 revenue grew 48% to $93.6 million and was above management's guidance for $89-90 million. Despite gross margin contracting slightly, operating margins expanded compared to the year ago period, leading to an EPS beat. Management also raised their revenue guidance by ~$9 million at the midpoint, greater than the ~$4 million revenue beat during the quarter.Investors have continued to expect significant growth numbers from this company and the past few quarters, investors have been somewhat disappointing. Despite revenue, margins, and EPS consistently coming in ahead of expectations, investors have become used to big revenue beat and raises. So when the company does not meet this undetermined quarterly revenue beat number, the stock can come under pressure.Valuation has pulled back since the late July high of ~35x forward revenue down to the current ~15x forward revenue. While this pullback was almost inevitably going to happen at some point, it is challenging to predict such a dramatic pullback in such a short period of time. Revenue growth continues to remain healthy and implies ~34-36% growth for the year, though I this could still be slightly conservative. Even if there is some conservatism baked into guidance numbers, investors are surely expecting revenue growth to come in near 40% by the end of the year.With the stock currently ~$55 and valuation coming down yet again, I believe investors have an opportunity to buy a stock with revenue growth likely coming in 35%+ for the next few years on top of improving margins. FY21 revenue multiple of ~11x seems reasonable enough compared to other faster-growth software names and Zscaler has a significant growth opportunity within the cloud-based security industry.ZS offers two main products, Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). ZIA essentially is a secure internet and web gateway solution enabling customers the ability to use the internet through ZS in a fully secure way. ZPA provides customers with remote access to internal applications running on the cloud of a data center, with the applications never being exposed directly to the internet.During Q1, ZS reported another quarter of strong revenue growth, coming in at 48% to $93.6 million, which was above management's guidance for $89-90 million. While revenue growth has continued to decelerate over the past few quarters, the law of large numbers is starting to hit in as it becomes more challenging to maintain a 50%+ revenue growth when your revenue is approaching a $400 million run-rate. The company also has a history of providing conservative guidance, which can bring additional upside to quarterly revenue growth expectations.One bright spot was billings growth showing signs of acceleration, coming in at 37% growth to $88.3 million, compared to 32% last quarter. Billings continues to be an important metric for investors to follow because this drives future revenue growth. While billings growth did improve from last quarter, the growth rate remains well below revenue growth, which could mean continued revenue deceleration.Source: Company PresentationInvestors have become spoiled with the company not only beating their expectations, but beating them by quite a bit. However, the past two quarters have been a little different as the company is beating expectations, but it appears investors are expecting bigger beats. This is a challenging aspect to balance as a public company as if management sets guidance too conservative, then investors continually expect big beats. If management sets guidance too high, then the company risks not meeting or exceeding expectations. I believe ZS is caught in the first bucket of investors continually expecting more from the company.Source: Company PresentationGross margin during the quarter remained strong at 81%, though was down slightly from 82% in the year ago period. However, given the company's highly recurring software business model, gross margins should continue to remain ~80%, very strong even for a software company.While operating margins for the quarter did expand to 3% compared to 2% in the year ago period, I think investors are starting to expect a little more from the company at this point. Typically, when a software company starts to see their revenue growth decelerate, operating margins should be the beneficiary, however, a 1% margin expansion is a relatively small improvement for the quarter. With revenue growth coming in well above expectations, this led to EPS of $0.03 during the quarter, above expectations for breakeven.Source: Company PresentationQ2 guidance calls for revenue of $97-100 million, which was better than expectations for ~$93 million. In addition, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be $3-4 million, or ~3.5% margin at the midpoint, leading to EPS of ~$0.03 for the quarter.Full year revenue guidance was raised by ~$9 million at the midpoint to $405-413 million, up from $395-405 million last quarter. The ~$9 million revenue guidance raise was also bigger than the ~$4 million revenue beat during the quarter, implying continued strength throughout the year. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be ~4% at the midpoint, similar to previous guidance. In addition, EPS is now expected to be $0.13-0.15, a slight increase compared to the previous guidance of $0.12-0.15. I think investors were also expecting a little more EPS guidance raise, considering Q1 beat by ~$0.03 and the company raised revenue guidance.While billings guidance was raised by ~$10 million at the midpoint to $500-510 million, billings growth for the year is only expected to be ~29% for the year. The company recently hired a new CRO and they could be setting expectations low for the year in which we could ultimately see a string of beat-and-raise quarters.After initially reporting earnings, the stock went down ~15% over the following days. While now up slightly since reporting earnings, the stock remains nearly 40% below their late July highs. Valuation has significantly pulled back over the past few months and rightfully so. Valuation was once near 35x forward revenue as revenue growth was 60%+, but has pulled back to ~15x forward revenue now.Over the past few months, the investment community has pulled away from higher valued, faster-growth software names. The chart below shows a good job demonstrating how some of the higher valued software names have seen their valuations come down since July. While ZS experienced one of the larger valuation pullbacks, the company's stock remains near the higher-end of the valuation spectrum, given the company's ~50% revenue growth and significant market opportunity.Management's recently raised FY20 revenue guidance of $405-413 million appears to be slightly conservative even after the ~$9 million raise (after a ~$4 million revenue beat in Q1).The company currently has a market cap of ~$6.90 billion and with ~$675 million in cash/investments and no debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$6.25 billion. Using the midpoint of management's recently raised guidance, which appears to be a little conservative, this results in a FY20 revenue multiple of ~15.2x.Given management's current guidance implies growth of ~34-36%, we could assume slight deceleration in FY21. If FY21 revenue comes in at ~32%, which could be conservative if FY20 revenue beats and raises the remainder of the year, we could see FY21 revenue of ~$550 million, implying a FY21 revenue multiple of ~11.3x.Current guidance continues to have some conservatism baked into the numbers. The company recently hired a new CRO and they likely wanted the bar to be set relatively low, leading to potential beat-and-raise quarters throughout FY20. Q1 proved to be a beat and raise quarter and I believe we could see that happen again in Q2 and Q3.Investors seem to remain bullish around the name despite the initial pullback in the stock post-Q1 earnings. The stock did fall nearly 15%, though investors saw this as a buying opportunity, pushing the stock back up to the pre-Q1 level. ZS continues to have significant long-term potential to massively disrupt the cloud-based security market and this should be a name owned in almost all long-term portfolios. It is times like these where investors should look to pick up some shares.Right now, I am a buyer with the stock trading ~$55 and believe we could see quite a bit of upside over the next few quarters as the company likely beats their revenue guidance and raises full year numbers. In addition, investors will continue to re-gain the lost confidence in the name if numbers come in ahead of expectations, which could lead to a higher revenue multiple.Risks to ZS include competition from new players or legacy security providers. Its revenue multiple also poses a risk as these fast-growing names typically correct the most when the market begins to turn."
4307011,102101,2019-11-15T11:45:24-05:00,Zscaler doesn't offer a compelling risk/reward at the current valuation.This is a story stock backed by heavy SG&A spend.Zscaler needs to unlock more market size in the cloud security space for this to be a safe investment.I will be initiating a HOLD rating with a price target of $41.I believe the market has priced in the expected growth in the cloud market.,"Source: TelegraphAfter Zscaler's (ZS) recent sell-off, investors have been trying to reposition ahead of the next earnings call. For long-term investors, I'm sure you're not worried, especially if you got in early. Timing is key. For new investors, the thesis remains the same: hunt for a pullback. Patience is also key. I will be sharing some visuals alongside some analysis proving that Zscaler is still not cheap. I have a HOLD rating with a price target of $41.According to Gartner, the cloud secure web gateway market is expected to grow at a rate of 25% in 2019, while the appliance-based secure web gateway market is expected to grow at 7%. Zscaler is a leader in the cloud secure web gateway market which was valued at $2 billion in 2018.Zscaler is one of the fastest growth plays out there. If it hits its revenue target this year and next year, valuation ratios will come down by 40%. Management made it clear during the last conference call that it will keep spending money to pursue growth. Therefore, come next earnings, we shouldn't be surprised by a revenue beat and earnings miss. The world has bought into the cloud migration narrative, and Zscaler is trying to position itself as the go-to vendor for cloud security. The last earnings call was all about the narrative that Zscaler is the cloud security king. It was easily clear that investors shouldn't bother scrutinizing profitability ratios. This isn't safe; regardless, I'm bullish on Zscaler's growth initiatives, which will be driven by new additions to the leadership team to drive sales efficiency and a ramp in OPEX to expand its total addressable market.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha, data in millions of USD)Zscaler isn't a profitable business. However, profitability ratios aren't as bad as other SaaS plays. Like I argued in my previous thesis, Zscaler relies too much on its cloud proxy solution. While this is the future, Zscaler will need to keep spending a lot on SG&A to help the market transition from appliance-based SWGs (secure web gateways) to cloud SWGs. This partly explains the EPS miss last quarter. Going forward, I expect Zscaler to double down on its marketing strategy to achieve this goal.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha, data in millions of USD)To achieve its lofty future growth projections, Zscaler has to keep spending on stock-based compensation to attract top talent.Cash flow from investing activities has been driven by CAPEX spend and purchase of intangible assets. There is a strong possibility that Zscaler will look into more acquisitions to sustain its cloud security domination in the coming quarters.Cash flow from financing is a function of its issuance of common stock. This trend will continue as more stocks reach their vesting period. Also, investors shouldn't rule out the possibility that Zscaler will issue debt as the debt market has been more attractive due to lower interest rates.Lastly, Zscaler has a strong balance sheet with zero debt. Overall, its financials aren't the most attractive, given the lack of profitability, and negative cash flow.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Zscaler appears expensive compared to its sector median valuation ratios. This is because it is expected to grow at ~5x the sector median. This means Zscaler will take a big hit when the sector takes a small hit. Risk-averse investors should trim their position due to the huge volatility inherent in the stock. Zscaler reminds me of Proofpoint (PFPT) in 2016. Proofpoint had a similar momentum, narrative, and valuation. Proofpoint was all about growth with little regard for profit. The stock managed to stay afloat as management always found a way to renew the growth narrative. Zscaler's valuation might begin to stabilize if management can retain the growth narrative. From the last earnings call, it is clear Zscaler will be sailing in the growth direction. This doesn't erase the fact that Zscaler will sell-off off the back of a slight macro or competitive headwind.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)I have a price target of $41. This assumes revenue will continue to grow in the double-digit range as Zscaler capitalizes on the expanding cloud SWG market. This also assumes SG&A spend as a percent of revenue will come down from 67% in 2019 to 52% in 2024. R&D and COGS as a % of revenue are also expected to improve by 100 basis points yearly as Zscaler scales. Using the revenue assumptions above, assuming FCF % of revenue improves from 10% to 38% in 2024, driven by improved margins and cash collections, this gives a forward P/S of 12x and a P/FCF of 69x.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)I consider this estimate bullish as it assumes Zscaler will be profitable within the next five years. Also, it is near the average P/S (FWD) ratio of a basket of unprofitable SaaS stocks. Value investors won't buy a stock with a forward P/S ratio of 12x. However, for the growth and momentum investors, this might be worth a try. Though, a recent note by Michael Hartnett of Bank of America indicates that a Long US Tech & Growth strategy now tops the most crowded trade. As it currently stands, investors have oversubscribed to these unprofitable SaaS plays, including Zscaler.Management did a great job quelling the fear of Zscaler's weakening competitive positioning painted by some competitors. Management laid out a convincing statement why firewall vendors can't compete with proxies when protecting a cloud network as most firewall-based solutions can't analyze encrypted traffic. These solutions were developed in the HTTP era. Today, the bulk of internet traffic is encrypted. Most malwares are also encrypted. Therefore, deploying a traditional firewall to inspect SSL traffic is like placing a police officer at the entrance of a cinema without a metal detector. The best he can do is a pat-down of movie-watchers.Source: GartnerNortonLifelock (NASDAQ:NLOK) remains Zscaler's biggest competitor in the cloud SWG space. It was also voted ""the most often replaced,"" according to a Gartner survey of all vendors in this quadrant. Zscaler remains positioned as a leader in the cloud security segment due to its niche strategy and rapid revenue growth. Zscaler will continue to ride on its current momentum due to its unique specialty in cloud security proxies, which can analyze encrypted traffic.History suggests Zscaler's valuation will keep normalizing and revising to its mean, given its EPS guidance of margin sacrifice for growth pursuit. I'm not comfortable betting on Zscaler's proxy solutions at the current price and margin. As a result, I will be initiating a HOLD rating with a price target of $41. I consider this a bullish estimate.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4295420,105419,2019-10-07T12:30:28-04:00,"Recent Bloodbath for 50 Software Stocks.We share a detailed analysis of Zscaler, and then review Avalara and Zendesk.Babies are being thrown out with the bathwater.","After years of outperformance, many high growth stocks have been crushed in the last month, and software stocks (IGV) have been among the hardest hit. In our view, this pullback has created some highly attractive investment opportunities. This report reviews data on 50 software stocks that have been taken to the woodshed recently, and then highlights three that we believe are particularly attractive. Specifically, we first share a detailed analysis of Zscaler (ZS), and then review Avalara (AVLR) and Zendesk (ZEN). We conclude with our opinion on who might want take advantage of the dramatic pullback.For starters here is a look at the 50 worst performing software stocks (Software Infrastructure and Software Application) over the last month (with a minimum market cap of $500 million). The mostly green columns show the powerful sales growth of the companies that have sold off, and the mostly red column shows how bad performance has been over the last month.And whether you believe the sell-off was driven by nefarious quantitative traders or a long overdue correction, is less relevant. What matters in this case is that a few attractive companies were caught up in the sell-off, thereby essentially making them babies thrown out with the bathwater, in our view.Zscaler is one attractive name on the list. If you don't know, Zscaler is a disruptive, cloud-based, information security company. And we like the businesses for a few big reasons, including its ""cloud first"" approach (which is a big advantage over legacy businesses), its superhero CEO, Jay Chaudhry (he's built multiple very successful cloud business in the past), and its very high customer retention rate (hackers aren't going away, and enterprises aren't going to ditch this subscription service during a market downturn). Plus, it's already free cash flow positive, it has very high gross margins, it's growing revenues rapidly, and the total addressable market is huge and will grow for many years. Further, these shares sold off for all the wrong reasons, including misconceptions about competition (Jay Chaudhry directly contradicted Palo Alto's ridiculous assertion during their respective quarterly calls), and the shares got caught up in the recent software industry sell off. Zscaler is an attractive buy right now.""Cloud-First"" Approach: Zscaler's mission is to empower organizations to realize the full potential of the cloud and mobility by securely connecting users to applications from any device, anywhere. And that gives the company a huge advantage over legacy information security companies that are trying to adapt their old school businesses to the cloud-based mobile world. Specifically, legacy competition is designed to secure onsite servers with firewalls, but everything is now moving to the cloud. In contrast, Zscaler was built from scratch in a highly scalable and ultra-fast multi-tenant cloud security architecture-something legacy providers only wish they could say. Further, Zscaler's subscription model makes it more attainable for users (the upfront costs are lower).High Quality: Zscaler is highly regarded in the industry. Administrators appreciate the visibility and granular control it provides over policies, and the seamless integration it allows with third party applications. According to one recent analyst report, he's ""never met a group of customers as positive about a product as these were about Zscaler's."" CTOs and CIOs of Zscaler clients are well-known to take Zscaler with them to new companies when making career moves, which is a testament to the value and quality of the product.Superhero CEO, Jay Chaudhry: Chaudhry is a serially successful entrepreneur with a track record of successful ventures and completed exits (he previously founded and led AirDefense, CipherTrust, CoreHarbor, and SecureIT, all of which have been acquired or merged). And considering that he exited all of his previous startups, it's noteworthy that ZScaler is the first business he plans to build for the long term. And the fact that Chaudhry opened a cloud-based security business in the early days of 2008 shows he has the type of forward-looking vision that can keep ZScaler ahead in the industry.""Recession Proof"" Subscription Model: Hackers aren't going to just disappear during a recession, and companies aren't going to ditch their information security solutions (Zscaler) during a market downturn. For perspective, according to CEO, Jay Chaudhry, during the most recent quarterly call, the:Attractive Forward-Looking Financials: Zscaler turned free cash flow positive in 2018, and has maintained that trend through the first three quarters of 2019. We see this as a strong sign of financial health. Further, it has very high gross margins. In particular, Zscaler's Non-GAAP gross margins stood at 82.0% for the latest quarter, a slight improvement year-over-year (it's closer to 70% on a GAAP basis). And management expects the margin to remain unchanged in the long term, as gross profits increase. 80% is a very high and attractive margin.(source: Left Brain, Factset)Further, Zscaler is growing its revenues rapidly (as shown in the table above) thanks to high demand and the company's many attractive qualities (as we will describe in more detail below). According to CEO Jay Chaudhry (on the most recent earnings call):And what's even more appealing about the revenue growth is the very large total addressable market (as we will cover in the next section), combined with the highly capable and newly hired Chief Revenue Officer, Dali Rajic.Large Total Addressable Market (""TAM""): One of the important things we look for in an attractive growth businesses is a large (and expanding) total addressable market, and in Zscaler's case, they've got it. Zscaler CEO, Jay Chaudhry, had this to say about the TAM on the most recent quarterly earnings call:More specifically, the TAM for Zscaler is estimated to be $20.3bn (as of May 2019) based on the company's analysis on IDC data using disparate markets for security applications that perform the same functions Zscaler offers through its platform.Anecdotally, a general increase in awareness of internet threats and data breaches has made cybersecurity a growing concern for businesses worldwide. And the secular trend of businesses transitioning to the cloud is a major tailwind Zscaler productsDifficult Comps: There have been some misconceptions about the competitive environment that have recently caused the shares to sell off hard. For starters, as mentioned earlier, Chaudhry notes that the most recent quarter sales grew at a little slower rate year-over-year (53%) against a very difficult comparison. Also, the company announced very conservative forward guidance as they brought on a new Chief Revenue Officer (mentioned earlier) so he would have room to transition and grow. However, the short sited market incorrectly interpreted this transition period, and the shares sold off, despite continuing dramatic long-term growth prospects.Absurd Statements from the Competition: And pouring a little fuel to the selloff fire, Palo Alto (PANW) absurdly stated during its most recent quarterly call, that:And:Chaudhry strongly corrected those statement during Zscaler's quarterly call stating:Chaudhry went on to explain, alluding to firewall company, Palo Alto Networks:Further, Chaudry said:Software Sector Sell Off: Also, worth a reminder, Zscaler shares got caught up in the recent software industry sell off as mentioned earlier. However, this is a business that is not as sensitive to cyclicality considering companies are able to simply drop their information security solutions (Zscaler) just because the market environment slows. This is a stable, high renewal rate, business.When we wrote our previous report on Zscaler (a month and a half ago) we loved the business, but were cautious about the valuation, explaining the ""expensive valuation [indicates] that the market has likely factored in the company's high growth trajectory and industry leading position."" Since that time, the company announced strong quarterly earnings numbers, the market valuation has come down significantly, and we still love the business (especially at the new lower price). For perspective, here is a look at a couple of the valuation multiples we consider, both of which have come down significantly over the last month (attractive); EV/LTM Sales is more recently under 20x, and EV/NTM Sales is now under 15x (per Factset).(source: Left Brain, Factset)Overall, Zscaler's growth is impressive, especially considering attractive business model and the large and growing TAM. Keys to continuing growth will be the ongoing expansion of their product ecosystem and continued momentum in acquiring market share. Readers can access more information about Zscaler using our 7-pack presentation, as well as our Zscaler full report, linked above (both written a month ago when the shares were trading significantly higher). In a nutshell, we like the business, the ongoing growth trajectory, and the share price (particularly following the recent share price pullback).Avalara is another attractive name on the ""babies thrown out with the bathwater"" list, in our view, and it stands out for two main reasons. One, its attractive business, and two, the increasingly attractive price. We wrote about Avalara in detail last week (see: Avalara: Large Market, Significant Catalysts). And the high level summary is that this is an attractive cloud-based tax compliance software business that has been growing rapidly (despite the recent sell-off), and it has three big catalysts that should propel the shares much higher: (1) the South Dakota versus Wayfair Supreme Court Case, (2) the secular trend towards the cloud (it's still in the early innings), and (3) rapidly growing investor interest. Avalara is a very attractive business, and we believe the recent sell-off could provide support for another impressive stock price rally, especially considering the business is quite attractive.Zendesk is another attractive name on the list of 50 that have recently sold-off. If you don't know, Zendesk offers customer service products (whereby businesses can interact with customers through phone, chat, email, and social media). And we like Zendesk because sales growth is rapid, margins are high, the total addressable market is large (and expanding), and Zendesk has been successful in displacing legacy players in its newly entered CRM market.Per our investment philosophy, we know that markets get emotional, prices become irrational, and that patience and flexibility are significant advantages. Whether you believe software stock prices were irrational before the sell-off, or they're still irrational now, a variety of attractive businesses in the space exist. For example, of the 50 software stocks with share prices that sold-off so hard over the last month, we believe some of them are attractive and worth considering. For example, Avalara, Zendesk and Zscaler (see our Zscaler full report), to name a few."

Margins remain unimpressive while valuation is cooling off. Litigation and capex expenses will continue to impact margins in the near term. This is driving a compression in multiples, offering an attractive entry point for growth investors. The near-term momentum appears weak; as a result, investors should be ready to buy on further pullbacks.Zscaler delivered a solid Q1'20 quarter. Revenue grew by 48%, while the dollar-based net retention rate stood at 120%. This was driven by the strong adoption of its SWG, CASB, and private access solutions. Going forward, management is guiding for revenue growth of 31-35%. For the full year, revenue is expected to grow at 34%-36%. Going forward, I expect the demand for Office 365, its partnership with system integrators and global cloud adoption to continue to drive growth. Its leadership in the secure web gateway space was reiterated by Gartner once again, and this supplements its brand positioning, heading into RFPs in Q2. As a result, I remain bullish on the demand for its solutions in the near term.Zscaler continues to capitalize on a free lane opened up by the business transformation that happened at Symantec as customers seek security partners to help in their cloud migration. The company added more capabilities in threat intelligence from its acquisition of Trustpath, and its integration of Appsulate into its CASB solution is ahead of plan. This is going to improve its product value proposition going forward.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Besides the announcement on its B2B (secure access to B2B apps) and ZDX (monitoring user experience) products, not much stood out after it released its numbers for Q1'20. Gross and operating margins decreased due to higher stock-based compensation and marketing activities. While operating cash flow benefited from the increase in stock-based compensation, net income worsened q/q. Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)In the face of decelerating growth, margins are supposed to reflect management's focus on unit economics, sales efficiency, and the improvement of the product pipeline and other strategies geared towards improving total shareholder return. While this is easy to overlook, given strong revenue growth, it will become more pertinent in the coming quarters. Given the HQ launch and pending litigation with Symantec, I expect the margins trend to continue the weak momentum in the coming quarters.Zscaler continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with $378m in cash and cash equivalent. Overall, Zscaler has a lot to improve on. Management appears to be capitalizing on taking as much market share as possible. This isn't a bad idea itself; however, fielding only its proxy solution doesn't provide enough product diversification.Management once more highlighted the uniqueness of its proxy solutions. Growth ex-US remains strong. Zscaler is highly positioned in the secure web gateway space, as highlighted by Gartner. As more enterprises demand simplicity in their cloud security configuration, players like Zscaler, which provide CASB, DNS, zero trust capabilities, will come up top.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)The cloud space remains oversubscribed. It's hard to find a sector producing the rapid growth we are experiencing within the cloud space. My concern remains that the frothiness will attract more speculators than value investors who are going to hold for the long term. Given the fickle investing style of speculators, I remain confident that further corrections are imminent.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)The cybersecurity sector remains expensive at a TTM P/E of 30x. Zscaler's valuation has cooled off, and it's now moving towards its peer average. Compared to the tech sector, it is expensive, and this is a function of its forward growth, which is expected to come in at about 4x the sector median. I don't see the case to revise my revenue growth forecast or FCF expectations. Zscaler remains a pure cloud proxy player with little assistance from its VPN solution. Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)If Zscaler makes a big acquisition, the growth narrative will be strengthened if the acquisition is immediately accretive to revenue. This will send shares soaring. If Zscaler continues to beat and raise guidance in the coming quarters, the rapid revenue growth will dilute valuation multiples. This is because Zscaler's current valuation suggests it has attracted a lot of growth speculators and keeping the growth story alive will play a key role in emboldening the conviction of growth investors. As a result, the thesis that valuation will cool off won't play out.Also, Zscaler has a pending lawsuit (patent) with Symantec which was recently acquired by Broadcom (AVGO). This led Zscaler to guide that the litigation expense incurred from the lawsuit will impact free cash flow. Here is the latest update on the lawsuit from the last form 10-Q:Source: AuthorZscaler's valuation is cooling off into the bargain territory. I remain cautious buying into the lack of product diversity beyond cloud security. Though the company is adding more capabilities, however, in seasons of lower than expected demand or revenue collection, the stock will be susceptible to a correction.

4315427,52852,2020-01-06T13:11:14-05:00,"Short interest more than doubled in 5 months.Despite the stock getting cut by almost half, ZS remains very expensive.Rapid growth declaration and compressing margins are feeding competitive paranoia.There is little evidence of competitive share losses.","Ah, Zscaler (ZS), I remember you, good old friend. I remember watching your roadshow back in March 2018, putting in my order with your underwriters, and getting zero allocation. You got priced at $16 per share, and closed your first day up over 100%.Now looking at you, I'm reminded of Bob Dylan's Like A Rolling Stone:Alright, putting my serious hat back on: ZS got cut almost in half since August 2019, so I'm ""bargain"" hunting, hoping to find a high conviction idea like FORR (read my article Forrester Could Double). And boy, at an EV to next-twelve-month sales of 12.4x, it is still a very expensive stock. Just because it traded at an incredible 26.3x back in August does not mean it is discounted now, especially with FY20 (fiscal year ended July) consensus estimates for sales showing significant deceleration while the company remains unprofitable after accounting for stock-based compensation.Moreover, the stock's rapidly rising short interest is alarming since it is a clear sign that professional short sellers are betting against the stock. I would know since I used to be a professional short seller (but since receiving the dharma I have renounced the sinful livelihood). In August 2019, the short interest was around 10% of float, but this rapidly increased to over 22% -- more than doubling in a short period of time. (Source: FactSet)So the question -- and the subject of this article -- is to figure out why the bears might be shorting the stock, and if these are valid reasons or overhyped fears.Looking at ZS's stock, the problem clearly surfaced between August and September of 2019, causing the stock to get cut almost in half:The big gap-down occurred on 9/11/2019, after the company reported its Q4 FY19 earnings. Billings grew 32% in the quarter, well short of buy-side expectation and a massive deceleration from Q2's 74% growth and Q3's 55% growth.In the Q4 FY19 earnings call, management noted elongates sales cycles, which pushed out a few large deals into the next FY. The explanation management gave seems fuzzy to me. Management said it wasn't a macro issue and it wasn't a competitive issue, so that leaves execution. On the same day of earnings, the company announced that it is hiring a new Chief Revenue Officer, and any major changes to the sales organization is always fear-inducing for investors in high flying technology stocks. In the call, management noted that they are hiring a lot of sales people and they need a more sophisticated sales methodology. All of this suggests that the company has hit a growth wall. The question now is if it is a TAM issue or a fixable execution issue -- or if management is lying about the competitive environment.While we wait to find out, we know that management will invest heavily in its sales force, which seems to be broken at this point. This investment and decelerating growth led to a weak FY20 guidance of +26% to +28% billing growth and operating margins of around 3.9%, a significant compression from FY19's 8.3%. Now we have an ugly combination of a high multiple stock with massive growth deceleration and compressing margins.My reading and chat with other market participants suggests that the bears believe that the real issue is that ZS is rapidly losing its first mover advantage in the increasingly competitive and fast changing cloud-based security market. Specifically, the market seems to be worried about Palo Alto's (PANW) Prisma Access, which competes directly with ZS. (Learn more about Prisma Access here.) PANW's CEO, who has a sales background, is of course talking up Prisma Access every chance he gets. In PANW's Q1 FY20 earnings call, he said the following:Not surprisingly, ZS's management downplays PANW as a competitive threat. During ZS's Q1 FY20 earnings call, its CEO said the following:And from my notes on the December 2019 Barclays TMT Conference, ZS's CFO noted ""there isn't much competition out there."" The CFO said they heard about the ""noise about competitors"", but they are very confident in their competitive position. ZS's CTO said he isn't worried about the competition and called Palo Alto's Prisma Access a ""retro fit to the cloud"" and won't work as well as ZS's solutions. ""You can't take firewalls, virtualize them, stick it in GCP, and become a Zscaler.""I looked around a bit, and did not find conclusive evidence that PANW's Prisma Access is taking market share from ZS. I think it is still pretty early days for Prisma Access. As quoted previously, PANW's CEO noted that their sales incentive helped Prisma sales but hurt firewall sales -- this doesn't sound sustainable since firewall is their core business (note that PANW's stock took a hit after reporting last Q's results). Moreover, I suspect PANW spreading itself too thin by being acquisitive and rolling out too many products too quickly -- this is a topic to be fleshed out in a later article. Unfortunately, ZS is in a ""he said, she said"" situation. While there is little real evidence that ZS is losing out to intensifying competition, the stock is still plagued with a high multiple, rapidly decelerating growth, contracting margins and a rapidly rising short interest. Unless you have some kind of special insight, I wouldn't recommend getting involved at this point. I'm staying on the sidelines for now."
4317774,99986,2020-01-19T07:27:59-05:00,"Zscaler is up nearly 60% off of its Q4 lows, after enduring a mini-bear market in the back half of 2020.While the company's growth remains robust on both the top and bottom lines, we are beginning to see material signs of deceleration in sales growth in FY-2020.To add to the growth in deceleration, the valuation isn't terribly attractive, with the stock currently trading at a revenue multiple above 22.For investors interested in buying Zscaler, I believe they should wait for pullbacks and not be tempted to chase the stock above $61.00 per share here.","It's been an exceptional start to the year for the Software Group, with the Software ETF up 7% to start the year and the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK) up 6%, both outperforming the S&P 500 (SPY). Zscaler (ZS) has benefited from this strength, and is up over 30% year-to-date, making up for its lackluster H2 2019 performance of (-) 38% after the stock endured a mini bear market following lackluster earnings guidance in the company's fiscal Q3 2019 results. While valuation improved significantly from extreme levels in Q3, the new issue for the stock is a trend of material deceleration on the horizon. Based on this, I see no reason to chase the stock at current levels above $61.00.(Source: Company Website)Investors in Zscaler have been on a roller coaster ride the past year, with the stock holding the title of the leading software performer to finish Q2 2019 before being halved in the back half of last year. The catalyst for the fall from grace was a mediocre fiscal Q3 2019 earnings report that didn't come remotely close to justifying a revenue multiple of 40. This prompted a nearly 60% decline in Zscaler's stock and was a wake-up call to investors used to buying every double-digit dip. Fortunately, the stock is off to a much better start in FY-2020 and has managed to put up a 30% return in the first 12 trading days alone. This incredible performance has helped Zscaler to regain the title as the top-performing software stock to start the year, as well as the #1 ranked gainer for 2020 among the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF (IWP). (Source: TC2000.com)Investors in Zscaler are likely cheering on this massive outperformance, but the stock has its work cut out for it in 2020. Not only is the stock battling a high likelihood of material deceleration in sales growth, but it's also sporting a technical chart that remains messy. Based on fiscal Q2 2020 estimates, Zscaler's revenue growth rate is expected to slow by 900 basis points sequentially, and only decelerate further into the back half of 2020. Let's take a closer look at the company's growth metrics below:Beginning with annual earnings per share [EPS], the company's earnings trend is exceptional, despite what's expected to be a minor hiccup in FY-2020. As we can see from the chart below, Zscaler finally flipped to profitability in FY-2019 after reporting annual EPS of $0.24. This trend is likely to turn lower and drop more than 30% year-over-year to $0.15 in FY-2020, but I don't see this as a significant issue. The reason for this is that the drop-off is expected to be a one-off, as estimates are looking for new all-time highs in annual EPS for FY-2021 at $0.28. Given that the market is forward-looking, the drop-off in FY-2020 is old news, and nothing for investors to get hung up on here.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)As William O'Neil has pointed out in the ""A"" of his CANSLIM criteria, the best growth companies with the most outstanding performance can consistently grow annual EPS at a rate of 24% or more. Based on FY-2021 estimates of $0.28, Zscaler's annual EPS should grow at a pace of 80% or higher for their next fiscal year, with this trend expected to continue at a similar rate for FY-2022. This strong growth rate in the coming two years suggests that we can discount the FY-2020 hiccup, as long as this does end up being just a 1-year hiccup for the stock. Given the 85% growth rate in FY-2021 and expected 57% growth rate in FY-2022, Zscaler has one of the most impressive forward earnings trends in the US market currently. If we move over to quarterly revenue growth rates, however, things are a little less positive. As the chart below shows, Zscaler averaged a quarterly revenue growth rate of 53% in FY-2018, and 59% in FY-2019, but saw sales growth of only 48% year-over-year in fiscal Q1 2020. The fiscal Q1 2020 reported revenue of $93.6 million represented a 500 basis point slowdown sequentially from the 53% growth rate in Q4 2019, translating to a quarter of what I would term material deceleration. While a single quarter of material deceleration is not a huge issue, multiple quarters are, and that's what we're looking at for Zscaler.(Source: Koyfin.com, Author's Table)As we can see from the chart above, fiscal Q2 2020 revenue estimates are currently sitting at $103.7 million, representing only 39% growth year-over-year. Unless Zscaler can trounce these estimates, this would represent a more than 2-year low in quarterly revenue growth rates, and a massive 900 basis point deceleration sequentially. This slowdown would trump the 800 basis point deceleration we saw in Q4 2018 (53% from 61%), and is also occurring from lower levels. Therefore, this is an issue and not an anomaly that can be discounted.If we look further ahead to fiscal Q3 2020, revenue estimates are pegged at $108.1 million, representing only 37% revenue growth year-over-year. This would mark yet another quarter of deceleration and another 2-year low in revenue growth rates. While earnings estimates are not set in stone, this underwhelming growth on a comparable basis is not a great sign for Zscaler. Fiscal Q4 2020 estimates aren't any better, with a high likelihood for another quarter of sub 40% growth year-over-year, based on the projected growth of 35%.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)I prefer to use a two-quarter average for revenue growth rates as it helps to smooth out any lumpy quarters and better dictates the overall trend. As we can see from the chart above, this deceleration is not a one-quarter anomaly but is part of a pattern of a meaningful slowdown. Based on the fact that the two-quarter average for revenue growth rates has gone from a period of acceleration to deceleration and is down 20% from its highs, it's not surprising the stock was derailed in Q3. However, if the company cannot put up a few blow-out quarters and report revenue well above estimates, the two-quarter average is likely to drop to 38% by fiscal Q3 2020. This figure would represent a drop of over 1,200 basis points from the current 50.5% two-quarter average revenue growth rate.In summary, Zscaler's growth metrics are a little muddled, as the powerful forward earnings trend is offset by an alarming deceleration in quarterly revenue growth. To prevent the material deceleration that's likely for the coming quarter (fiscal Q2 2020), Zscaler will need to report $107 million in revenue. This is possible given the current estimates of $103.7 million, but it will not be an easy feat. Therefore, given that earnings growth rates and revenue growth rates are diverging, I would view Zscaler as a less attractive long candidate currently.(Source: YCharts.com)If we take a look at Zscaler's valuation above, an investor might immediately conclude the stock is cheap as ever, as the company's revenue multiple is down 40% from its peak. While this would be a logical conclusion to arrive at, I don't think this is entirely true. It is, of course, true that Zscaler's revenue multiple of 22.5 has improved drastically from its revenue multiple of 40, but I don't believe the stock's valuation ever belonged near there in the first place. As the table below shows, the median price to sales ratio of stocks leading up to the Tech Wreck in 2000 was 46.6; therefore, Zscaler was near bubble territory at a revenue multiple of 40 in July. Based on this, I see it as somewhat irrelevant where the valuation has come from, and I do not believe the valuation is cheap at current levels.(Source: The Internet Bubble, Author's Table)Looking at growth leaders in the Software Group, we can see that the median price to sales is currently near 26 among names like Paycom Software (PAYC), RingCentral (RNG), CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD), The Trade Desk (TTD), and Zoom Video (ZM). Therefore, Zscaler may be reasonably valued at a revenue multiple of 22.5 but is hardly cheap. It's also worth noting that the group is getting quite expensive on a valuation basis. Therefore, Zscaler only looks cheap on a relative basis vs. a group of names that are sitting at extreme valuations.(Source: YCharts.com)If we move over to the technical picture, we've also got a minor problem, as Zscaler is one of the few names in the group that has been unable to reclaim its 200-day moving average. As the chart below shows, more than 80% of software stocks are currently above their 200-day moving averages, but Zscaler has yet to. This would suggest that while the majority of the software group are in intermediate uptrends and bull markets, Zscaler is range-bound, and has work to do to move back into an intermediate uptrend. Generally, it pays to own the names in uptrends within a sector, not the names that can't keep up with the group. For Zscaler to join the group above its 200-day moving average (yellow line), it will need to put in a daily close above the $63.00 level.(Source: Author's Data & Chart)(Source: TC2000.com)If we zoom in further on Zscaler, we can see that the stock has resistance looming overhead at $64.25, with strong resistance at $73.00. Given that the $64.25 area is where the stock broke down from initially after its remarkable 2019 run, I would argue that this might be a tough spot for the stock to get through on its first try. As long as the bears can defend $64.25 on a weekly close, they will prevent the bulls from regaining the upper hand on momentum. Based on this, I believe any rallies to this $64.25 level would provide traders with an opportunity to book some profits. For this reason, it makes little sense to chase the stock at $61.00 currently when it's within a whisker of this critical resistance level.(Source: TC2000.com)Zscaler may be a market leader in the Software Group, but the stock's technicals remain messy, and we have a high likelihood of material deceleration in growth on the horizon. Given the fact that the stock is trading at a price to sales ratio above 22 and is coming up towards strong resistance, I see this as an unattractive area for investors to be chasing the stock. Instead, I believe patience is the best course of action here for investors that are looking to add Zscaler to their portfolio. The bears will remain in control as long as they defend $64.25 on a weekly close, and I would view rallies to this level as an opportunity for traders to book some profits."

Source: GoogleSoftware-as-a-service (SaaS) adoption is expected to grow at roughly 15% annually to reach $144B by 2022. Companies are increasingly reliant on cloud software providers such as Salesforce, Slack, and Microsoft that deliver their services over the internet. Source: GartnerIn the past, mission-critical workflows used to be done on-premises and security perimeters are mostly confined to companies' own data centers. However, this shift in SaaS adoption has led to a shift in pathways. When these pathways were on-premises, security appliances were usually managing internal workflows. Once companies migrate their workflows to the cloud, the workflows have to travel back and forth to the cloud. This exponential growth in pathways increases the number of connections required to secure this traffic. Instead of self-reliance or relying on the public's cloud security, Zscaler's value proposition is to provide a platform of security services to secure the cloud workflows. Source: Zscaler Analyst DayWith a strong value proposition, Zscaler has achieved revenue growth above 50% in recent quarters. Revenue has grown from $80M in 2016 to $303M in 2019. Within the same period, gross margins have also expanded from 75% to 80%. Growth is also likely to continue. In their Q4 2019 transcript, Zscaler CEO Jay Chaudhry highlights that they are investing significantly in sales and marketing: Source: Zscaler Analyst DayMoreover, Zscaler has been named a leader in the Gartner SWG Magic Quadrant positioned the furthest for completeness of vision for 8 years in a row. Being a leader helps Zscaler acquire new customers in trying out at least one of its services before potentially expanding to other services. This helps to drive growth more efficiently than other companies in this space.Source: GartnerZScaler uses a land-and-expand model targeting enterprises by first providing a proxy gateway and then bundling other services together. Besides increasing their total addressable market beyond the current $20B, this serves to increase the switching costs for Zscaler. Source: Zscaler Analyst DayAs companies adopt more services using Zscaler's platform, they become more entrenched with time. Once Zscaler proves that they are able to meet the security needs of companies, companies become increasingly unlikely to switch even if cheaper competing services emerge. With the threat landscape across data packets become increasingly complex, companies are likely to trust their existing security provider with their mission-critical workflows. This is reflected in Zscaler's high net dollar retention rate of 118% for FY19. As Zscaler broadens its platform to expand its total addressable market, they are likely to face increased competition from other network security providers like Palo Alto and Cisco. These players have longer history working in this space with large customer bases. They also have huge resources to compete with Zscaler, as seen from their transition to cloud solutions as well. Public cloud companies Like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon could also build similar multitenant security clouds if they choose to compete in this space. Although it is likelier for them to partner with companies like Zscaler, a large enough market with attractive economics could lead to those public companies competing in this space in search of growth.To value Zscaler, I used a DCF model with the following assumptions:1) Revenue growth at 35% for the next five years, then dropping to 2% in perpetuity, starting from the year 2025. The high growth rates in the first five years reflect Zscaler's strength in the cloud security space and track record of strong top-line growth. Coupled with a large and expanding total addressable market, Zscaler should be able to execute high sales growth for at least the next five years. However, Zscaler faces many potential competitors in this space and may experience some headwinds in growth if it is faced with execution issues.2) Operating margin of 35% from 2024 onwards. Enterprise software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. Zscaler should be focused on growth right now, so there is definitely room for margin expansion and operating leverage in the future. Furthermore, it has expanded its gross margins from 73% in 2015 to 80% in the latest fiscal year. However, if competition heats up, Zscaler might have to spend more on sales and marketing, which might create some short-term pressure on operating margins.3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing security software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate Zscaler will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) Zscaler has an initial weighted cost of capital of 9.07%, which stabilizes at 8% in the terminal year. This higher cost of capital reflects the fact that Zscaler is still losing money, which makes it riskier. However, the cost of capital should trend downwards as the company move towards profitability.  Source: Author creation using Zscaler financialsThe value I derived for Zscaler is roughly $6.5B for the entire company. This represents a 9.5% upside from its current price. As with all DCFs for high-growth companies, my point estimate valuation of $52.7 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against similar high-growth software companies.Source: Author creation using data from Seeking AlphaCompared to other high-growth peers like Okta and MongoDB, Zscaler looks relatively cheap in terms of price/sales and EV/sales ratios with a better operating margin. It is considered more expensive compared to Twilio but has a better operating margin as well.Source: Author creation using Zscaler financialsHowever, Zscaler would be considered overvalued if sales growth and operating margins fall below 35% based on the table above. Potential investors have to decide if they believe Zscaler will be able to execute according to my base-case assumptions in the long run. If competition turns out to be stronger than expected and pushes down future sales growth or operating margins, the recent pullback might not make Zscaler a screaming buy."

Unfortunately, the market didn’t like the outlook for the new fiscal year.The market seems to be taking the facts at face value and may be overreacting to the information.After having lost almost half of its valuation, ZS seems to be giving investors an opportunity to buy the dip.","Zscaler (ZS) is down almost 50% from its July 2019 high, even after beating estimates on revenue and EPS, according to its fiscal Q4 2019 earnings report, released in September 10.Fundamentally, the company is pretty much the same as it was in July. The revenue and deferred revenue kept rising above 50% over the previous 12 months, the gross margin is above 80%, the net retention rate is at 118% and growing, and the customers continue to come in at a nice pace.But the market is probably concerned with factors such as a weaker-than-expected fiscal 2020 outlook, a stronger threat from Palo Alto (PANW), a supposed peer-lagging revenue growth, increased competition among its channel partners, and macro concerns from longer deal execution with the largest customers.Moreover, the market sentiment on the SaaS space is not positive, and other related stocks have been declining in recent weeks.After having lost almost half of its valuation, ZS seems to be giving investors an opportunity to buy the dip.(Q4 2019 Company Presentation)(Note: You may keep this section, if you already know the story).The company saw another strong quarter, with solid top-line growth and appealing profitability margins. Unfortunately, the market didn’t like the outlook for the new fiscal year.The revenue for the quarter was $86.1 million, a growth of 53% Y/Y. Investors may not appreciate that ZS failed to keep the growth rate as high as that of the previous quarters, when it was between 59% and 65%. But I see this performance more like a return to historical growth rates, considering that it is closer to the CAGR seen during the 2015-2018 period. Also, the management mentioned on the earnings call that Q4 2018 revenue was sweetened by non-recurring $1.4 million from a government customer. Without this additional revenue, this quarter’s growth would be 57%.Deferred revenue also grew by 53% Y/Y to $251.2 million, and calculated billings grew by 32% Y/Y to $125.8 million. The growth in billings seems worrying, but the strong growth in deferred revenue suggests that the growth in billings must be rather cyclical. As long as ZS is able to hold a strong growth in deferred revenue, a slower growth in billings shouldn’t be a major concern.The gross profit grew by 54% Y/Y to $68.8 million, representing a gross margin of 80%. The change in gross margin was flat Y/Y. Since ZS has reported 80% gross margins for fiscal 2019 and 2018, the margin should stay this way for the quarters to come.It is promising to see the company generating a non-GAAP operating income of $7.9 million (GAAP -$7.9 million) for the quarter, while in Q4 2018 it incurred in a loss of $2.4 million (GAAP -$7.9 million). The non-GAAP operating margin was 9% vs. -4% Y/Y. With this increase in the non-GAAP operating margin of 13 points, the net income margin rose 13 points as well, from -2.5% a year ago to 10.5% this quarter (non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $9.1 million vs. -$1.4 million Y/Y).The cash flow from operations was $17.8 million (21% margin) vs. $14.7 million (26% margin) Y/Y, while free cash flow was positive at $7.6 million (9% margin) vs. $11.9 million (21% margin) Y/Y.On a full-year basis, the revenue was $303 million, up 59%, and the gross profit was $243 million (80% margin), up 60%. The non-GAAP operating income was $25 million (8% margin) vs. -$15 million in 2018.Non-GAAP net income was $30 million (10% margin) vs. -$14 million in the previous year. Cash flow from operations was $58 million (19% margin) vs. $17.3 million in 2018, while free cash flow was $29.3 million (10% margin) vs. $2.1 million a year ago.ZS continues to get the most from its user base, with a net retention rate of 118%, up from 117% in fiscal 2018, and 115% in fiscal 2017. While growing the number of customers from +3,250 to +3,900 during the year (20% growth).Investors should have in mind that this has been an outstanding fiscal year for ZS. I use two metrics that in some way measure the efficiency of the company to demonstrate it: revenue growth, and sales and marketing expenses’ efficiency.The S&M efficiency is calculated by dividing the difference in revenue of two periods (consecutive years, or the same quarter of consecutive years) by the amount of S&M expenses of the earlier period. In other words, it measures how many dollars of new revenue the company earns for every dollar spent on sales and marketing.The averages for these metrics between 2015 and 2018 are 52.5% and 81.4%, respectively. Given this, the revenue growth was 59% (6.5 points up), and the S&M efficiency was 97% (15.6 points higher). The revenue growth tends to deviate from the mean, but not this much. While the S&M efficiency tends to be stable, performing quite close to its mean, which makes it the most impressive of these metrics.The driver of this outperformance was the strong growth experienced by deferred revenue and calculated billings in 2018 of 70% and 65%, respectively, which were also astounding to ZS standards.The point of me telling you that 2019 was an outperforming fiscal year for ZS is to ready your mind for a “seemingly weaker” fiscal 2020. From this point, it is very difficult for ZS to achieve +50% revenue growth during fiscal 2020. Fiscal 2019 is a very tough comp.By saying this, I don’t mean that the growth in billings or deferred revenue should be lower as well; that would be something to worry about. If ZS keeps deferred revenue growth above 50% in fiscal 2020, forget about any sluggish revenue or billings growth, everything would be right.Moving on, the guidance for fiscal 2020 seems lower than expected and is regarded as the main cause of the 20% sell-off of the earnings date. The revenue for the full year is expected to grow between 30% and 34% to a minimum of $395 million and a maximum of $405 million. Calculated billings are expected to fall between $490 million and $500 million, implying a growth between 26% and 28%.What I think the market didn’t like the most from the guidance was the decreased profitability, which is expected to come between $13 and $18 million in non-GAAP operating income and between $0.12 and $0.15 in non-GAAP EPS. Both figures are lower than the $30.3 million in non-GAAP operating income and the $0.22 in non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2019.Management expects to raise S&M expenses for fiscal 2020 and has already hired a CRO to lead its salesforce. So the lower profitability makes sense. Keep in mind that it may drive higher revenue growth in the future.This guidance represents significant deceleration in the three most important growth metrics of ZS:(Data from Company Filings)I believe that the market expects the company to outperform its guidance, as it has done in previous periods. With this in mind, the 20% sell-off should be an overreaction from the market.I think that investors are taking a conservative guidance too seriously. It is true that there are some competition and macroeconomic concerns, as management mentioned on the earnings call. But I don’t see any of these priced in the guidance. In fact, this year’s outlook is not too different than that of a year ago (on a growth basis Y/Y).If you check the numbers from Q4 2018, you will see that fiscal 2019 revenue was expected to average $255 million. Thus, the current guidance represents a growth of 57% from the previous one. On the other side, the market didn’t sell the stock a year ago, when the management expected a lower revenue growth of 34% (down from 51% in 2018) and deeper losses than the previous year.Also, this guidance would imply a significant deterioration in the S&M efficiency ratio, which I already discussed, and the execution of deferred revenue. The table below summarizes the performance of these ratios during recent years:(Data from Company Filings)If the management had said that it expects revenue to average $440 million (45% growth), I would buy it because the efficiency of S&M would be 81%. It doesn’t make sense that ZS had spent $170 million in S&M during fiscal 2019 to expect less than $100 million of new revenue in 2020 (lower than 2019’s ~$113 million).Furthermore, the trend in the execution of deferred revenue has been quite strong in the 190% level. It was down in fiscal 2019 because the growth seen in deferred revenue during 2018 was a compelling 70%, an outlier performance for ZS's standards. As the deferred revenue during fiscal 2019 was 53% (more characteristic from ZS, and a good result by the way), the ratio should be higher in 2020 than in 2019.By these metrics, I think that this fiscal year’s revenue should fall between $440 million and $490 million (45%-62% growth from fiscal 2019). You may think that I’m too optimistic, but ZS has experienced aid from non-recurring government customers’ business, and the trend might continue.As I said in the prior section, the market may have overreacted to the management guidance for fiscal 2020, but what about other concerns?Back to August 19, OTR Global downgraded ZS from mixed to negative, with a -8.5% price reaction from the stock. The analyst mentioned that ZS's growth seems to be below that of the security market, and the competition among ZS channel partners is increasing.Then in September 5, we saw some trash talk from the management of PANW in its quarterly earnings call, citing that it had displaced ZS and other peers at two large customers in the US and Europe.Finally, in September 11, a few security firms cut their price targets on ZS due to the weak EPS guidance and competition concerns.So, the market is supposedly concerned with a weak guidance, lower-than-average growth, and competitive threats. But, should it be? Let’s see!I don’t agree with the part where ZS is lagging the competition on growth matters. Look at the following table with a comparison of the rates of revenue growth featured by competitors:(ZS latest 10-K filing and Macrotrends)The only companies of this group that can hold a candle to ZS are FTNT and PANW, but none of them perform half the growth of ZS. You may think that this list omits other fast-growing cybersecurity players such as Proofpoint (PFPT), Okta (OKTA), CyberArk (CYBR), Carbonite (CARB), Qualys (QLYS), Akamai (AKAM), and Splunk (SPLK), but these companies are growing revenues at 15-35% (except for OKTA with 50%). My point is that ZS is growing faster than its peer group, and the company is healthy enough to keep the lead.On the competitive side, I think that ZS is quite exposed to channel partner competition (it generates 96% of its revenue from its partners), hence at least, there is a risk to consider. Also, the comments from PANW shouldn’t be taken at face value. Think about this, what could be the impact on retention or churn rates to ZS if it loses a Fortune 50 customer? Some points at least.On the earnings call, the CEO mentioned that customer churn rate decreased Q/Q and Y/Y, and the dollar-based retention rate for the last 12 months was 118%, the same as in Q3. If ZS lost a large customer (or two as PANW suggested), neither the retention nor churn rates could perform like this. ZS is a relatively small player, and large customers tend to have a significant impact on revenue growth (either up or down).As I see it, PANW may have won two large deals to ZS, FTNT, and SYMC. No big deal! Why the management of PANW didn’t mention the times ZS has won a deal from PANW? Some organizations will arbitrarily favor one provider over the rest, and the best product in the market may not satisfy certain customers, inducing the latter to switch providers in the blink of an eye.After having lost almost half of its value, the stock is in interesting territory, offering some upside potential. Also, with the negative sentiment on SaaS stocks, it may fall even further.Since ZS's direct competitors are not good comps, I will match it against other SaaS stocks growing revenues at similar rates. On the following table, I compare ZS with Anaplan (PLAN), Elastic (ESTC), Okta and Smartsheet (SMAR):(Data from SEC Filings and Companies’ Presentations)As you can see, ZS is trading at a lower valuation multiple than other stocks in its growth cohort. But it gets more interesting; ZS was the leader of this group on valuation until August. See the chart below for more details:(YCharts)As history tends to repeat itself, it wouldn’t take long for ZS to regain its lead. Considering that it has been trading at a higher sales multiple than OKTA, the stock could rise to more than $70, with a minimum 38% possible growth.Although I see a chance to go up, there is also some room to fall further. ZS looks undervalued to some of its peers, but the SaaS market as a whole seems to be overvalued, and it looks like it is falling to correction territory. And when I say correction, I mean that I hope it is only a correction, and not the beginning of a bear market on this space. So there is significant risk on this name.After having lost almost half of its value, ZS seems to be giving investors the chance to buy the dip, before it heads higher again. The fundamentals continue to be strong, with revenue for the last 12 months and deferred revenue growing 59% and 53%, respectively, while the gross margin staying flat at 80%.The outlook for the new fiscal year wasn’t well digested by the market, although it is normal for SaaS companies to guide conservatively. Also, the market is concerned by competitive threats. I believe that there is some degree of overreaction, and the stock should head higher soon.ZS seems to be undervalued relative to some stocks of its growth cohort, and the comparison suggests that the price could rise at least 38% to $70.As other SaaS stocks, ZS has a high valuation and could trade in line with the broader SaaS market, which is in a precarious situation. So the stock is quite risky.I would recommend to wait for the price to go sidelines, or stop decreasing, before opening a position."
4292908,104608,2019-09-22T21:49:56-04:00,"Zscaler reported a strong quarter with revenue growing 53% and billings growing nearly 50% when excluding a large deal from the year ago period.Management provided billings guidance that was light of expectations, noting larger deals taking longer to closer.Valuation remains attractive at ~14x FY20 revenue, assuming the company continues on their beat-and-raise pattern.","Zscaler (ZS) reported a strong Q4 with revenue growing 53% and billings growing ~50% (when excluding a large contract realized in Q4-18), both ahead of consensus expectations. However, management provided billings growth for FY20 that was below expectations in addition to operating margin of ~4% at the midpoint, compared to FY19 operating margin of ~8%.As a result, and likely a bit needed, the stock's valuation took a big hit. Once trading ~35x forward revenue, the stock saw the multiple crumble to ~15.5x and instead of being an outlier, now falls within the range of other fast growth software names. The stock initially traded down over 20% after reported earnings before slowly recovering a bit over the past few days. However, with the stock still ~$50, I am a long-term buyer at these levels.Data by YChartsThe pullback was an evil necessary as valuation got a little out of control. No matter how fast a company is growing, any multiple above 20x forward revenue is challenging to justify over the long term. Yes, revenue growth continues to remain healthy and over 50%, but guidance implies a decent amount of deceleration and billings growth challenges could tame investor excitement over the next few weeks.However, given management's history of conservative guidance and beating estimates, I believe the stock is set up nicely over the next few quarters with some beat-and-raise potential. Assuming the company comes in ahead of their initial guidance, the stock is trading ~14x FY20 revenue, in line with other software companies growing revenue 20-30%. At these levels, I am a long-term buyer.ZS offers two main products, Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). ZIA essentially is a secure internet and web gateway solution enabling customers the ability to use the internet through ZS in a fully secure way. ZPA provides customers with remote access to internal applications running on the cloud of a data center, with the applications never being exposed directly to the internet.During Q4, ZS reported revenue growth of 53% to $86.1 million, which was above consensus expectations for ~$82 million. Even though revenue growth has decelerated over the past few quarters, this is expected given the company's increased scale and large of law numbers. The company has a history of guiding to beatable numbers and continues to do so.However, this quarter was a little bit more about commentary around billings. This continues to be the most important metric investors follow as it is a clearer line of sight to future revenue growth. During the quarter, billings grew 32% to $126 million which was well ahead of consensus expectations for ~$115 million. While this is well below the 53% revenue growth, ZS did have a large deal ($16.5 million deal) in Q4-18 and excluding this, billings growth would have been closer to 50%, more in line with the company's historical growth.Source: Company PresentationEven though the adjusted billings growth was more than acceptable, management noted that a few of the larger deals were taking longer to close during the quarter, which is likely to big reason why the stock was down ~20% in the days following earnings. Management noted that the longer sales cycle was not due to increased competition or macro factors, though noted the increase in new sales reps could have some impact.While this has had a big near-term impact on the stock (in addition to weaker than expected guidance), I believe the company continues to be conservative in their growth expectations and we could see beat-and-raise quarters all of next year.Source: Company PresentationGross margins during the quarter continued to remain very healthy at 81% and actually expanded slightly from 80% in the year ago period. For the full year, gross margin was 81%, an impressive margin for a highly recurring software business.Operating margins were also impressive at 9% during the quarter compared to (4%) in the year ago period. Operating margins for the quarter were well above consensus estimates for ~2%, which demonstrates the company's ability to leverage their operating expenses as they gain scale. The revenue beat combined with better than expected operating margins led to EPS of $0.07, ahead of expectations for ~$0.01.Source: Company PresentationQ1 guidance includes revenue of $89-90 million, which was slightly higher than consensus expectations for ~$88 million. Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to be about breakeven with EPS of $0.00-0.01.For the full year, management is expecting revenue of $395-405 million, representing growth of 30-34%, which seems pretty conservative considering the ~59% revenue growth during FY19. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be ~4% at the midpoint, meaning they expect operating margin to contract from the ~8% during FY19. This led to EPS of $0.12-0.15, which was below consensus expectations for ~$0.20.The biggest disappointment from guidance was billings of $490-500 million, representing ~27% growth at the midpoint. The company recently hired a new CRO and they could be setting expectations low for the year in which we could ultimately see a string of beat-and-raise quarters. Nevertheless, the 27% billings growth likely disappointed investors and was one of the main reasons behind the stock's big pullback.Valuation has significantly pulled back since reporting earnings, and as I discussed in a previous article from April, I noted valuation looked pretty excessive at ~28x forward revenue. While the company ultimately expanded their multiple to nearly 35x, the stock currently sits at a more appealing 15.5x forward revenue.The market has slowly moved away from these higher valued names largely due to fears of a global economic slowdown and valuations getting a little bit out of control. I find it very challenging to justify any company trading above 20x forward revenue and the chart below shows a few of the higher valued names pulling back over recent weeks.ZS continues to have significant long-term potential to massively disrupt the cloud-based security market and this should be a name owned in almost all long-term portfolios. It is times like these where investors should look to pick up some shares.Data by YChartsManagement's FY20 revenue guidance of $395-405 million seems to be a little conservative considering the company's history of conservative guidance and the large implied deceleration.ZS has a current market cap of ~$6.3 billion and with $365 million of cash/investments and no debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~5.9 billion. Using the midpoint of management's FY20 guidance, this implies a FY20 revenue multiple of ~14.8x. Assuming the company beats the revenue guidance by a few percentage points, we could ultimately see FY20 revenue come in closer to $420 million, would would be ~14x FY20 revenue, a much more appetizing valuation.Investors continue to be pretty bullish around the name despite the recent pullback. While I believe the pullback was necessary given forward revenue valuation was reaching some pretty unprecedented levels, I think the pullback also provides a great buying opportunity.The initial guidance appears to have some conservatism baked into the numbers. The company recently hired a new CRO and they likely wanted the bar to be set relatively low, leading to potential beat-and-raise quarters throughout FY20.Right now, I am a buyer with the stock trading ~$50 and believe we could see quite a bit of upside over the next few quarters as the company likely beats their revenue guidance and raises full year numbers. In addition, investors will continue to re-gain the lost confidence in the name if numbers come in ahead of expectations, which could lead to a higher revenue multiple.Risks to ZS include competition from new players or legacy security providers. Its revenue multiple also poses a risk as these fast-growing names typically correct the most when the market begins to turn."
4316468,105235,2020-01-13T09:39:50-05:00,"With growth rates declining from the high 60% to the high 40% in less than a year, Zscaler is not the hot stock it used to be.
        The new head of sales is increasing sales expenses, hence the revenue growth should get to a more sustainable rate around 45%.
        Profitability will experience short-term headwinds with the increase in sales expenses, as the new sales manager sets up its salesforce to bring more growth, but it should improve in the.
        The valuation is low comparing to other stocks growing in the 40% and 50% levels, and the risk-reward profile is compelling at 1-to-2.5.","In recent years, emerging cloud stocks have delivered nicely and have outperformed the whole information technology sector. But, 2019 has seen investors doubting about the fundamentals of those high-flyers as their growth rates have significantly decelerated and their ability to improve profits has been slight.(Source)A typical high-flyer of late 2018 and early 2019 was Zscaler (ZS), whose revenue growth accelerated from 49% in the quarter ending April 30, 2018, to 65% in the quarter ending January 31, 2019, justifying a stock price that doubled during that time and almost tripled in the months that followed. In its best times, ZS used to trade at 40 times trailing revenues.After topping at 65%, revenue growth has been decelerating for three quarters in a row. With the revenue growth, the stock price has decreased as well, losing roughly 40% from its high of July 2019. Also, revenue growth is not the only metric that has suffered here.The full list includes deferred revenue growth, calculated billings growth, and remaining performance obligations (RPO) growth. Just RPO growth decreased from 68.8% in 2Q19 to 34.9% in 1Q20. The chart below describes this deceleration:(Author)In addition, this is the stock price since early June:(Author)Leaving all that behind, ZS seems a bit attractive in 2020. I expect revenue growth to be at bottom in 2Q20, and then reaccelerate from that point. I’ll explain.Considering that 2Q19 had phenomenal sequential growth of 17.4%, it is the toughest quarter to beat in ZS’s history as a public company, so further deceleration is guaranteed for 2Q20. But, 2Q20 could be the inflection point investors are hoping for.See, as 2Q19 was the best reported quarter (on a revenue growth basis) for ZS, 3Q19 was indeed the worst quarter that the market has seen so far, with just 6.5% of sequential growth.With that and the normalization of growth in 4Q19, I believe that ZS will reaccelerate by late fiscal 2020 to ~45%, and will continue growing at more than 40% in fiscal 2021 as well.I think the introduction of the company’s latest solutions, Zscaler B2B and Zscaler Digital Experience, will boost expansion rates and overall growth. These solutions are being tested by early customers, and are receiving positive feedback.On top of this, I feel optimistic about the recent hiring of Dali Rajic as President of Go-to-Market and Chief Revenue Officer (CRO). Rajic had a prolific career at AppDynamics, rapidly growing from a regional sales manager to CRO in about four years.Fiscal 1Q20 was the first quarter of Rajic at Zscaler, and his efforts are already reflected in the financial statements, as sales and marketing expenses grew sequentially by 20%, a record for a first quarter at ZS.My only regret regarding increased sales expenses is the negative effect on profit margins. But, still these margins could thrive in fiscal 2020. The chart below compares margins of operating income, non-GAAP operating income and free cash flow from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2019, and then from 1Q19 to 1Q20.(Author)On an annual basis, the three metrics have improved up to fiscal 2019. And on a quarterly basis, the story changes a little bit, but only at the GAAP level, as stock-based compensation related to sales expenses grew from $2.8 million to $10 million. We’ll have to see what happens in the rest of fiscal 2020, but I think that even with increased sales expenses, non-GAAP profit margins will do well.Normally, I would value ZS by comparing it with other SaaS stocks with growth rates around 50%. But, as I expect revenue growth to decelerate to the mid-to-low 40s for 2020 and 2021, a wider comparison including stocks growing at 40-50% would be more suitable in this case.With that, in the table below, I’ve gathered some stocks with such a level of growth:(Author)In the table, the shaded figures represent the best of their class. For example, Smartsheet (SMAR) has the best gross margin of the group, The Trade Desk (TTD) rules on operating margin, and ZS commands in valuation, growth and efficiency score (Rule of 40), and scores second and third places in gross and operating margins, respectively.So, companies growing in the 40-50 percentages are trading at trailing revenue multiples of 19x-32x. Assuming that ZS will achieve growth of 40% in fiscal 2020 (ending July 31, 2020), its market cap could sit anywhere between $8 billion and $13 billion. I’m inclined to believe that it should end near the lower half of that range, or between $8 billion and $11 billion (I’m being conservative here, since ZS has better fundamentals than most stocks in the table). The company expects to have 139 million shares outstanding by fiscal year end, so this valuation range translates into a stock price of $57-to-$79 by mid-to-late 2020 (calendar year).This range implies an upside potential of 18%-65% in less than twelve months, from nowadays prices of ~$48.What if revenue doesn’t grow at more than 40%? What if the company achieves only 35%, or even 30% revenue growth? I’m talking about missing the analyst estimates and its own guidance for the next three quarters.I think that 30% growth is highly unlikely, so I’ll take the company’s guidance for the fiscal year 2020 of $409 million, representing a growth of 35%, as my worst case scenario. SaaS stocks growing at 33%-37% are trading at an average of 12 times trailing revenues (conservatively speaking), so ZS could have a market cap of $5 billion. With 139 million shares outstanding, the shares would trade at $35 each, representing a downside potential of ~26%.Zscaler is not the hot stock it used to be. Its growth rates have declined from the high 60% to the high 40% in less than a year. Such a deceleration has made the stock price to plummet and brought the market expectations down to earth.Revenue growth should decelerate further into 2Q20 due to 2Q19 being a tough comp. But, with the new head of sales increasing sales expenses, and 3Q19 and 4Q19 being easier comps, growth should reaccelerate to a more stable and sustainable rate of ~45%, which would span fiscal 2021.Profitability will experience short-term headwinds with the increase in sales expenses, as the new sales manager sets up its salesforce to bring more growth. But, it may thrive in the years to come, as this company has a clear path to profitability.The valuation seems interesting. It is low for stocks growing in the 40% levels, and even for those in the 50% levels. Also, the risk-reward profile is compelling at 1-to-2.5. So, go long ZS."
4291392,98236,2019-09-13T10:49:13-04:00,"ZS reported its fiscal Q4 results earlier this week.The guidance provided was considered disappointing and the shares-already down because of concerns about valuation and competition-declined an additional 20%.ZS, now down about 43% from its high, has reached a valuation level (EV/S) just slightly above average for its growth cohort.The company specifically refuted the aspersions that have been about its competitive positioning and results.The company did voice a modest concern about the macro environment potentially impacting large deal sell cycles.","This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more here.In a single word: NO!The sector rotation that got underway on July 26th has claimed another victim and created a great opportunity for investors. I don’t think I will try to reprise arguments concerning the rationality, the duration or the extent of that rotation. Nor will I try to evaluate the global economy. There are reports that attempt to tackle both issues on SA and in many other publications. This article is more or less focused on Zscaler (ZS)-although given the specific comments of the CEO about large deals and their possible slippage due to macro factors, I can’t avoid at least some comment regarding the specifics of that statement, and the possible meaning of what was said, or interpreted.Zscaler is a name that has seen more than a bit of controversy since it went public a little more than a year ago. Only 5 of the 12 analysts who cover the name, recommend the shares-almost entirely a function of valuation concerns, although recently some analysts have expressed concerns about competition as well. Much, although not all, of the controversy has raged about its valuation and there has already been an article on SA suggesting that its valuation is still extended. I have been positive on the name, although a couple of months ago I did trim some of my position as its valuation, based on my EV/S analysis brought it above average for its growth rate.At this point, and using Thursday's close, the shares are down about 43% since the high they made along with many IT names on July 26. The shares had been buffeted by a downgrade from the OTR brokerage followed by negative reaction to commentary from competitor Palo Alto coupled with sector rotation, and the combination of those 3 events took 31% from valuation using the 7/26 base. The shares are trading down another 20% in the wake of the earnings release.The culprit, or so the headlines say, is weak guidance-or as I might suggest, guidance that was not as ebullient as some holders (and despite my trim, I am a holder) might have hoped or anticipated. I will discuss the specifics below, but in essence, the company guided in-line for revenue forecasting 34% growth and below the First Call consensus for EPS, forecasting $.12-$.15 compared to the prior consensus of $.19.Zscaler reported the results of its fiscal Q4 and presented guidance for its fiscal year 2020 earlier this week. The results of the quarter that were reported were a noticeable beat in terms of both EPS and revenues. The growth of billings at 32% for the quarter had been forecast by the company and related to the bookings in Q4-2018 which were driven by one time $16.5 million booking from a single Federal order. The particular billing in question was a multi-year arrangement and there was no comparable transaction this year. Excluding that single transaction, the growth in billings was 58%. The growth in billings for one year payment terms was greater than 50%. Remaining performance obligation as reported grew by 39% to $554 million for the year. Similar to the billings number, the number for RPO was influenced by the one time transaction which added $26 million to the RPO balance in Q4-2018. Excluding that transaction, the RPO growth would have been 49%.I don’t try to rush to judgement in the articles I prepare. Sometimes that kind of a rush precipitates some factual errors. Such indeed is the case with some of the brokerage reports, including one from a prominent firm, that I have parsed. It is unfortunate when leading firms report such wildly inaccurate data. In this case, the actual performance of apples to apples billings performance in the last quarter did not show the growth deterioration that has been headlined when making appropriate adjustments for one-time events. The company did not miss its billings target, and the quarter to quarter change in actual billings growth and the growth in RPO was quite small when adjusted for year-earlier one-time events. Billings growth was a bit slower than in the prior quarter, which in turn was stronger than the preceding quarter. These changes are typical of a smaller company which can and does sell larger deals to a few customers.As it happens, the company did see some strong growth in its new customer count this past quarter. The company announced a new head of sales-filling a position that had been vacant for a considerable period. While no doubt, the new head of sales will bring his own twists and predilections to the selling motion, the results this past quarter do not suggest any broken sales model. I think it would be more difficult to sustain a bear case when having to acknowledge that ZS billings rose 50% last quarter. As with most commentary related to guidance, I think the slowdown forecast should best be taken with several large grains of salt.The company reported that its dollar based net retention rate rose to 118%, slightly above prior levels. The CFO suggested that initial orders are running larger than in the past as the company sells a greater percentage of its Transformation Bundle (43% vs. 35% a year ago) which has a tendency to reduce that metric, one often studied by analysts.The company hired a new president/CRO, Dali Rajic. Mr. Rajic was most recently the head of sales at AppDynamics before that company was sold to Cisco on the eve of its IPO. The company has been without a head of sales for some time. In the wake of this hire, the company marginally reduced 1st half bookings guidance, giving Mr. Rajic some breathing space to ramp up the sales engine. Part of the earnings guide-down relates to a stepped up cadence of sales and marketing expense in conjunction with Mr. Rajic’s hiring, and the hiring of some other VP positions in the sales organization. While I will explore the issues of guidance and expectations later in this article in a bit more detail, it would strike me that very few businesses would step up their investment in sales and marketing spend on a percentage basis and expect that the investment would not produce something positive in the way of sales growth.Many headlines and some analysts have proclaimed that ZS has lost its competitive edge and that is why it produced what is considered to be mediocre guidance. I simply do not believe that this was the case or indeed that it will be the case. I do not propose to try to explain the advantages that ZS offers to its users in any great detail. I have linked to the Gartner Peer Access report for those interested, although the number of survey respondents is not large enough to be statistically valid. I have also linked to the latest Gartner MQ on the subject, although at this point, the study is 10 months in arrears and some people would say it doesn’t encompass the latest offerings from PANW. Should I interpose my own judgement into an evaluation. Simply put, there is a preponderance of straight-forward evidence that might suggest why ZS is winning, and will continue to win the market share struggle. against PANW.At this point, ZS offers two services, ZIA which is the core of the company and is based on a secure web gateway and a cloud sandbox. The company also offers ZPA which is the company’s private access solution set. At this point, ZPA is about 14% of revenues and growing faster than ZIA. There is less controversy that ZPA really is a better solution than legacy VPN, so I will not focus on it. ZIA grew by more than 100% last year, and its growth cadence is likely to continue at that level because of its ability to replace VPN’s which typically do not offer a great user experience.Within the broad security space, for many years, Palo Alto (PANW) has been considered to be the most dynamic force with many innovations to its credit. It dramatically disrupted the industry and overtook erstwhile leader Checkpoint (CHKP) along with a host of other cyber-security vendors. It pioneered NGFW technology. Its solution essentially involved the sale of appliance hardware to facilitate firewalls in many data centers operated by its customers. These days, it also offers a host of applications that run on those appliances. But to a greater or lesser extent, having firewalls as a first line of cybersecurity defense is no longer adequate in a cloud-centric environment.The fact is, firewalls were never meant to try to encompass the complexity inherent in modern networks, and users very often are dealing with multiple vendors for different applications, and with architecture that is almost impossible to decipher. The ZS solution with its own data centers, and 100% inspection as well has produced better experiences for users, at least so far as I can determine.I do not want to pretend to be an expert in cyber-security. There are almost certainly readers of this article who have professional skills with regards to that discipline. I do believe that this company’s CEO, Jay Chaudhry is well versed in the technology of cyber security-and is really one of the thought leaders of the industry. And I certainly believe that Gartner, while certainly not the end-all/be-all of consultants, has more than a bit of domain expertise. Gartner has produced a study which can be accessed on the ZS web site that discusses the evolution of cybersecurity from an appliance based security world to a world where security is in the cloud through what they describe as a Secure Access Service Edge.When ZS initially reached some scale and became a public company, its principle market opportunity was that of competing when users developed new networks. In the past year or so, as the cloud continues to grow and users migrate legacy applications to the cloud, ZS has started to displace legacy installations-from vendors such as PANW but other security competitors as well. It is that phenomenon, I believe, that has lead to the rather abrasive commentary that PANW management has offered with regards to ZS.Has PANW displaced some ZS applications as its CFO proclaimed at a recent analyst meeting? I won’t doubt that it has happened although I observe that the instances cited in the presentation that so impacted investors, showed ZS coexisting with other security vendors in the displaced installation. Many users have determined to reduce the number of vendors providing security solutions, and given the size of PANW it is not surprising that some of the displacements that they have reported most likely resulted from the desire of users to standardize on a single vendor regardless of the performance or ease of use factors. I once again would say that the churn reduction reported by ZS ought to put paid to competitive concerns.For a variety of reasons, at this point PANW has not developed a grounds-up technology with which to compete against ZS. There are certainly ZS competitors out there and the Gartner MQ report lists some of them. But really, like many other larger legacy vendors with substantial installed bases, it has proven difficult for PANW to develop a strategy that does not strand its legacy users but offers acceptable performance for new networks.Do I have the domain expertise to suggest that the appliances and the hybrid solutions that PANW is offering do not represent the leading edge of technology in this space? Not really. But the concept that is being sold is not one that resonates easily. The message of buying appliances but use a cloud service for remote and branch office applications is hard just to understand from a commonsense point of view.In any event, it really doesn’t matter what I might think about the logic of competing services; either readers believe the CEO or not when it comes to his commentary about the performance of ZS last quarter in terms of competition. In the prepared script, the CEO talked about the fact that the competitive environment remaining favorable, with high win rates and a strong net dollar retention rate. And specifically, and despite the commentary from PANW’s CFO a couple of weeks ago, the CEO talked about a decline in customer churn both year on year, and quarter on quarter. It is hard to reconcile that specific fact with a deterioration in competitive positioning. And despite the downgrade by one brokerage (OTR) based on their “survey” of 14 channel partners, large system integrators continue to grow as a percentage of this company’s business with over 50% of revenue now coming from global service providers and integrators who apparently were not amongst the 14 survey respondents that precipitated the brokerage downgrade.One area of contention relates to what is called proxy architecture. ZS uses it; PANW doesn’t. The conference call featured one set of queries on the subject-without debating the point, the answer of the ZS CEO and his examples on the part of users would seem to be dispositive. For the sake of clarity, here is the key part of the response of the ZS CEO with regards to this concern amongst some analysts:“In fact, I know of a very large bank that has spent ten of millions of dollars on a next-gen firewall and deployed them all over. And this bank is still depending upon a proxy technology to inspect to clear traffic for threats. That's one piece. Two, if you look at any vendor, who is doing any meaningful thing even sitting in front of servers like Akamai’s of the world. They all have proxy-based technology because without proxy, you have little or no control. Lastly firewall, which is a pass-through device was a good thing before the SSL world when traffic was not encrypted. Today in most of the cases, 90 plus percent of the cases, it's SSL traffic, TLS traffic. Firewalls were never designed to inspect SSL, proxy technologies needed for SSL, if you really don't inspect the traffic, it is like your luggage passing through an airport inspection check post without inspecting. That's not a good thing. So I think. These statements are meaningless, they mislead customers, they give them false sense of security and do a disservice to the security industry.”Investors shouldn’t really be committing funds to company’s whose CEO’s are not credible. There is nothing I really can add to this point beyond the comment of Mr. Chaudhry regarding the company’s competitive position:“Yeah, if I may add, I mean as we compete out there, we almost win every deal, very low situations where we don't win. So very comfortable with our differentiated technology, very comfortable with our sales process [Indecipherable]. We just need to make sure we can keep on scaling it as we set our targets for bigger and bigger numbers.”Win rates that are very high, declining churn and strong dollar based net retention-it sort of puts a spike in the argument that ZS is losing its competitive edge. When I try to evaluate companies, I do so by looking both at their reported numbers and guidance but also at their strategies and competitive position. I will discuss guidance, this company’s business model below, but when it comes to the opportunity, I more or less have to accept a credible management supported by the preponderance of the evidence at its face. I have seen many examples in IT where the David disrupts and ultimately upends the Goliath. It is hard not to see the parallels here and to focus on those opportunities as opposed to having what might seem to be a myopic view of traditional numbers.Is ZS valued at an appropriate price for investors? I think it is. There are many ways to approach valuation. The typical one seen in many brokerage reports is to construct some DPV model. In my experience as an analyst, I used such techniques on many occasions. I don’t like them since they are based on an assumed discount rate that is, of course, subject to change and require assumptions about terminal value that are almost always completely implausible. So, I rarely use price targets-and in valuing higher growth companies, I think price targets do investors far more harm than good.In the wake of the quarterly numbers from ZS, essentially all analysts who cover the name reduced their price targets because the company is going to spend more money on operating expense, and that in turn reduces the free cash flow number that is part of most DPV formulas on valuation. To be sure, price targets are usually based on 12 months expectations-and I expect-and indeed strongly believe-that ZS will spend more money on opex, and have a lower free cash flow than that which was in many models before this earnings release. The price targets ratchet down by rote, almost without any qualification that spending more on opex usually results in faster growth in future periods-else why do it?But the fact is, that if ZS can reclaim its growth status-and I believe it will-those price targets will go out the door and the share price will climb to valuations that will be decried by many. I prefer to use valuation expectations based on looking at EV/S vs. a trend-line based on growth and also incorporating an analysis of free cash flow vs. growth. Those measures are by no means perfect. The “fit” of the EV/S line only accounts for about 50% of the valuation differences between various IT names. In the wake of the earnings, and guidance, I obviously made adjustments, both to a 3 year growth rate projection, and the raw numbers to calculate the EV/S. I use a revenue expectation modestly greater than the consensus/guidance and I have reduced a 3 year growth expectation to 39%.Using those inputs, ZS shares, which for some months had been huge outliers, are now close to the average in terms of valuation for growth rate indicia. Not a bargain, but not mispriced either.So, why recommend the shares? The simple reason is that while credible 3 year growth expectations greater than 40% are not supportable based on the results and guidance, most investors and this writer believe that the technology on offer from ZS will continue to take market share from legacy vendors leading to many years of growth much greater than is forecast by the consensus.Looking at it another way, ZS these days has an enterprise value of about $6.6 billion, and revenues have been forecast to be a bit over $400 million for the next 12 months. Palo Alto has an enterprise value of around $20 billion, with estimated revenues of a bit greater than $2.1 billion. Will ZS ultimately overtake PANW-and if so how long will the process take? That is really the valuation bet one makes in evaluating the shares, and not all of the other quantitative measures that are used by many observers. It is not an easy question to answer, to be sure, because there are lots of moving parts. And obviously, no matter what I write and others say, there are shades of grey here, not 50 perhaps but many. And there are many differing opinions as well about the competitive wars that will rage between the various security vendors. But it is this writer’s opinion that the opportunity that ZS has to close the gap with PANW in terms of market share that supported its valuation in the past, will become evident again going forwardIf you own, or contemplate owning ZS shares, you are a growth stock investor by definition. Oh, you might be a trader playing for a bounce or speculating on a quarter, and if so, this article is not really for you. But if you are a growth stock investor, than the course that ZS has announced in accelerating its investment in both sales and marketing and in research and development is one that is prudent and logical and should be viewed as a positive. Very specifically, the CEO said that this company rarely loses when it competes-the obvious conclusion from that is the company needs to compete in more opportunities and it needs the opportunity to sell more products. So, it makes sense to dramatically increase the scope and depth of its sales coverage and to flesh out its product offerings. Its users have shown an increasing propensity to buy a broader set of solutions from ZS, both upfront and over time. To exploit that opportunity means to deepen sales coverage and to extend the product line. It would be illogical for the company not to address those opportunities.As mentioned, the company has been operating without a chief revenue officer for some time now. It has appointed an individual with star qualities-the track record of AppDynamics in terms of sales growth was such that it was able to secure a huge valuation when it got bought by Cisco (CSCO). With a CRO/President in place, and with some other sales management positions recently filled, the strategy of accelerating sales and marketing spend is one that can be executed with prudence and should lead to visible impacts on growth over coming quarters.The real question is the issue of the company’s rather mediocre revenue guide. I do not get the chance to cross question CFO's about the guidance they provide. But I have to ask the question, why bother with the exercise when the results simply defy common sense. This company has forecast that it will grow revenues 41% this quarter and 34% for the year. That must mean, that it will exit the year growing at less than 30%, despite a sharp acceleration in the rate of sales and marketing growth that it has announced. Basically, the company intends to raise its sales and marketing spending growth to something in excess of 40% as non-GAAP operating margins, which were 8% last year are supposed to fall to fall to about 3% this year.Those relationships do not seem terribly likely, and lead this writer to conclude that the company is most likely to see faster growth, and higher levels of EPS and cash flow than those that constituted its guidance.One comment that alarmed some investors, and is a counter to this line of reasoning was the portion of the script that suggested that the company had seen sales cycles lengthening for some larger deals, possibly based on macro conditions. Spending on cyber-security is self-evidently not really a discretionary expenditure. Users spend on cyber-security more or less because the alternatives are so much worse and there are so many requirements for privacy and data protection. The last recession experienced in this country spanned the end of 2007 through part of 2009. At that point, the cybersecurity space did not exist in the form that it has now assumed. There were no next generation firewalls. Palo Alto was 2 years old at that point and shipped its first product in 2007. So, there really is no experience as to the cyclicality of the cyber-security space. While the cloud existed at that point, the migration of applications was a gleam in the eyes of a few technologists.I certainly do not know that there will be a recession-I have my doubts. But if there is a recession, and IT spending growth is impacted, my guess is that cybersecurity spending will see less of an impact than areas such as apps and infrastructure. The impact of a breach is no respecter of where we are in the business cycle, and CIO’s that don’t act to prevent breaches preemptively are taking huge risks with key assets of a company. While I can readily believe that a company such as this might have issues with sales execution, the concept of cyclical cyber security spend is not one I find totally credible.ZS does not close a huge number of large deals over the course of a year-perhaps 100 or so, so it may be that what it has seen is not a trend but random-or perhaps is related to sales execution. But it is something of which to be aware. The issue is whether or not the 45% in share valuation since the recent peak reflects some of that uncertainty.In this last fiscal year, ZS achieved a rather substantial level of profitability-some of it probably unplanned, and some of it because it has operated without a CRO and wound up hiring less and spending less money on sales and marketing than should have been the case. That was particularly evident in this past quarter, a Q4 in which sales and marketing expense, in a quarter in which lots of commission accelerators were paid, grew by only 6% sequentially.The company has reported rather consistent gross margins in the range of 80% for some time now, and presumably this is a level of be anticipated for the next several years. Last quarter, GAAP sales and marketing expense was 57% of revenue, but as mentioned the growth decelerated from earlier in the year. For the full year of fiscal 2019, sales and marketing expense came to 56% of revenues, which compares to 61% the prior year.Inevitably some will question this level of sales and marketing spend, and it is high simply because of the huge competitors the company meets in the market. The company spent 20% of its revenues on research and development last quarter, up about 6% sequentially and up by 67% year over year. The company has a small amount of net interest income and in aggregate, its GAAP operating loss of 9% of revenues, is relatively small for its size and growth rate.Stock based comp trebled over the prior year period in the latest fiscal quarter and actually fell sequentially. Overall stock based comp at 14% of revenue is consistent with the average for companies of this scale and growth in the IT space.The company had a strong growth in operating cash flow which more than tripled in the year. The primary drivers of the increase in operating cash flow were the sharp rise in stock based comp coupled with strong growth in deferred revenues. Overall, the single largest component of this company’s operating cash flow remained the growth in deferred revenue balance which came about 160% of total operating cash flow.As mentioned, this company operates 150 data centers at this point, and it will continue to build out points of presence to manage latency and insure availability for its network. Latency is a big deal for users and is frequently advertised by competitors. Overall, capex almost doubled last year and that growth accelerated last quarter. Part of this growth relates to the company’s move to a new headquarters facility and the spending of a few million for tenant improvements. The company reported a free cash flow margin of about 9% for the year.Next year, the company is forecasting that its free cash flow margin will be noticeably lower than the results of fiscal 2019-as best as I understood the presentation, the company anticipates free cash-flow margins in the range of 3%-4%, but beyond fiscal 2020, it anticipates that free cash margins will be above non-GAAP operating margins.There appears to be a certain level of glee surrounding the share price implosion of ZS, and that glee apparently extends to evaluating the merit of making an investment decision at this point. I have no great desire to try to argue the case for or against the valuation of high-growth shares. That said, with a 43% share price reaction from a recent high, the outlier status of the shares has disappeared, and they are close to average on an EV/S basis for their high-30% growth cohort.The company has put forward what I believe to be a persuasive case as to why its is not losing its competitive edge. It has stated it wins competitive engagements at very high rates and that churn is falling, deal sizes are rising and it dollar based net expansion has ticked up despite larger initial deal sizes.It has hired a star quality CRO-and between products and personnel my guess is that current guidance will be handily exceeded. The cyber security space is unlikely to prove cyclical-if indeed there is a business cycle to track.I have suggested that readers/investors need to move beyond the confines of an analysis based on what I consider to be a myopic fixation with certain metrics, and try to consider opportunities holistically. I assume that the company will make that case far better than my poor keystrokes can do when it has its analyst meeting next week. I plan to increase my holdings of this name on an opportunistic basis over the coming weeks."

Enterprise cloud security company Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) beat analyst estimates for the fourth quarter but its weak outlook for FY2020 sent its stock tumbling.Zscaler's fourth-quarter revenue grew 53% to $86.1 million. Calculated billings grew 32% to $125.8 million. Deferred revenue grew 53% to $251.2 million. GAAP net loss was $5.3 million or $0.04 per share, compared to $7 million or $0.06 per share a year ago. Non-GAAP net income per share was $0.07, compared to a net loss per share of $0.01 a year ago. Analysts expected earnings of $0.01 per share on revenue of $82.8 million.Cash provided by operations was $17.8 million, or 21% of revenue, compared to $14.7 million, or 26% of revenue in Q4 2018. Positive free cash flow was $7.6 million, or 9% of revenue, compared to $11.9 million, or 21% of revenue a year ago. Cash and cash equivalents were $364.4 million as of July 31, 2019.For the full fiscal year 2019, Zscaler reported revenue of $302.8 million, up 59%.

I have already written two bullish articles that take advantage of these depressed stocks: Don't Look A Gift Horse In The Mouth and Another Huge SaaS Investment Opportunity. Today, my article is about a third really good SaaS company, Zscaler, Inc. (ZS).Zscaler is another hyper-growth company on my radar screen, having been beaten down this summer. As if that wasn't enough, it was kicked while lying on the ground as a result of lower guidance provided in the Q4 2019 earnings call a little over a week ago.(Source Portfolio123/MS Paint)Zscaler was soaring earlier this year, reaching a high of ~$90 in July but is now trading around $52, not far above long-term support of approximately $46.I wrote an article about Zscaler at the end of July when the stock was at its peak: Zscaler Is A Stock To Watch. At that time, I concluded that Zscaler would make a good long-term investment, but the stock price was too high.A 50% haircut is all it took to get me excited about this stock. I am now revising my rating for Zscaler from neutral to very bullish.In my opinion, the fear of growth slowdown is an overreaction to statements made by conservative management, a quality that most SaaS companies exhibit. Please note that the stock is slightly overvalued, but investors might not get an opportunity like this again for a long time.Analysts appeared to be concerned as a result of three issues: competition from Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW), reference to larger deals taking longer during the Q4 2019 earnings call, and lowered guidance for FY2020 also during the earnings call. I won't elaborate on these three issues because there is already an excellent article that covers these in detail that I recommend that you read: Zscaler's Beer Is Lots Colder Than Some Think.What I can say is that Zscaler management has provided conservative guidance and the company is going up against strong comps from 2018 which included a large multi-million-dollar non-recurring contract. In any case, these concerns have caused some panic among investors, but I believe that the stock price will recover from the recent selling activity.Zscaler has unveiled two new offerings, ZB2N and ZDX, described by Morningstar:(Source: Zscaler)Zscaler recently announced a partnership with CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD), an AI-based endpoint security provider. CrowdStrike offers real-time threat detection and automated policy enforcement. This partnership should provide better and more cohesive security coverage. The stock market looked on this announcement very favorably.It has been my observation, based on other SaaS companies, that an increase in sales and marketing spend directly results in more sales, more so than improvements in other areas such as product development. That is, of course, assuming we don't hear the three dreaded words: ""sales execution issues"".Zscaler is planning on scaling up its business in an effort to reach a target of $1 billion in annual revenue. The company will have to triple sales in order to reach that target. The company is upping its game with new hires:It sounds like the new CRO has quite a lot of experience, and I don't expect that we will be reading those three dreadful words. And no, I'm sorry to report that the new CRO is not Lionel Richie, his name is Dali Rajic.Zscaler is getting its fair share of business from Microsoft (MSFT) Office 365 as outlined in the most recent quarterly earnings call:(Source: Zscaler)I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing EV/forward gross profit (GP) multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/forward GP multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward GP versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 93 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The GP in the vertical direction is calculated using the ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database multiplied by the TTM gross margin. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Zscaler is sitting above the trend line, suggesting that its forward GP multiple is higher than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Zscaler is slightly overvalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.High-growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40%,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40% is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40% is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus profit adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40%:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40% calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available, (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition, and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin, others use operational cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor's perspective.TTM revenue growth is 59.2%, up from 51% in late-2018.(Source: Portfolio123)Zscaler's free cash flow margin TTM is 9.7% for the most recent 12-month period and has been positive since the company IPO.(Source: Portfolio123)Zscaler's YoY revenue growth was 59.2%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 9.7%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 59.2% + 9.7% = 68.9%The Rule of 40% calculation comes out significantly higher than 40%. Therefore, I conclude that the company is financially healthy.The market has been bearish with regards to SaaS stocks recently and Zscaler specifically. The attack on the share price may not be finished yet.Even a slight miss on guidance or drop in billings can result in a drastic share price revaluation as witnessed a week ago.There are many digital transformation stocks with extreme valuations, and it is possible that we could have further SaaS market revaluation in the future. In this case, I would expect to see Zscaler's stock price fall along with the rest of the market.The trade dispute between President Trump and China is ongoing and has the potential to cause market turbulence or even drive the United States into a recession.Approximately 51% of Zscaler's business comes from outside the US. It is possible that Brexit and/or economic conditions in Europe could cause a deceleration in Zscaler's international sales growth.Revenue could take a substantial hit if Microsoft were to introduce its own security solution that directly competes with Zscaler.The new hires will take some time to come up to speed, perhaps up to a year before we see any positive results in bookings. In addition, Zscaler will be spending more on facilities in 2020. These items could cause degraded financial results this year.Zscaler is one of many SaaS companies that have been caught up in rotation out of high-growth stocks by some large unknown funds. From late July to mid-September, Zscaler lost almost 50% of its stock price. The latest price driver has been fear over revenue growth stemming from the latest quarterly report. I believe that this fear is overblown and that the stock price will recover.Management has taken steps to boost sales, including the hiring of an experienced CRO along with several VPs. The company has introduced two new products, ZB2B and ZDX. Zscaler has also announced a partnership with another cybersecurity company, CrowdStrike.Company fundamentals, including free cash flow and fulfillment of the Rule of 40%, are quite good. Zscaler has a slightly overvalued stock price relative to its peers but this may be the only opportunity to invest in this quality stock for quite some time. I am giving Zscaler a very bullish rating."
4295530,105354,2019-10-08T03:19:38-04:00,"Zscaler recently announced several initiatives including a partnership with CrowdStrike and three new products.The company's competitive differentiation lies in its ability to leverage its data centers to improve cost and efficiency.The company remains the leader in cloud security, but customers are becoming increasingly aware of alternative cloud security offerings.Valuations remain high despite recent share pullback.","Zscaler, Inc.'s (ZS) shares have declined ~56% from their previous high after investors raised doubts about the company's ability to maintain its competitive differentiation amid an increasingly competitive cloud security space. To address these issues, management recently held an Investor Day to highlight their competitive advantage over Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW) vendors, and announced several key initiatives. While the company’s prospects are certainly exciting, I'd caution investors against buying in at current levels and instead, wait for a further pullback or a more attractive entry point. My EV/Sales multiple-based approach yields a fair value of $35.6 per share – shares are trading 35% over fair value.Investors recently raised concerns about Zscaler’s ability to compete successfully in the cloud security market following underwhelming Q4 results, which led to a massive correction in September.Data by YChartsThe focus has thus been on the company’s chances of maintaining its competitive differentiation in an increasingly competitive cloud security space, as well as its potential to consolidate within the broader security market.In its first Investor Day since its IPO, ZS executives provided insights on how the company plans to address these competitive pressures head-on. Firstly, the company announced a partnership with CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), integrating the resources of two high-profile “next-gen” security companies. In addition, three products (out-of-band CASB, ZB2B, and ZDX) will be in beta trial in the coming months for select clients with expectations to make these products available to the public in the January 2020 quarter. Finally, management also highlighted the massive expansion in its data center business – the Zscaler platform reached more than 150 data centers globally.Key highlights are as follows:CrowdStrike Partnership: The new partnership with CRWD will integrate the company’s cloud security platform and AI-powered Threat Graph. The CRWD/ZS alliance will allow joint customers to have real-time threat detection and automated policy enforcement, improving security across their networks and endpoints. This presents a strong value proposition to clients as it allows joint customers to leverage each of the company’s offerings (CRWD’s endpoint telemetry and ZS’ platform for artificial intelligence and machine learning) to more effectively secure their organizations.Lots of New Product Announcements: ZS also announced some major new products at the event - Out-of-band cloud access security broker (CASB), ZB2B (a ZTNA solution), and ZDX (Zscaler Digital Experience).Source: Pg 21 of Investor PresentationThese products are still in the beta phase with an expected timeline to be made available to the public in the January 2020 quarter. There were no pricing details yet, but I'd conservatively assume ZS will initially price these products on a standalone basis and include them in broader bundles later on. Below is a brief description of these products:1. Zscaler B2B: This new product aims to solve security challenges businesses face when their applications are exposed to end customers, manufacturers, and suppliers. The product enables authorized users to view the applications without exposing the applications to the Internet.Source: Pg 28 of Investor Presentation 2. Zscaler Digital Experience: The product offers basic application and compliance monitoring via leveraging more than 70 billion transactions processed in the Zscaler Cloud. Management sees this product as complementary with other application performance monitoring (APM) vendors such as NewRelic and AppDynamics, among others. Further, the product will provide customers with performance metrics on non-performing apps, while partnering with these APM vendors to gain deeper insights into the cause of these issues.Source: Pg 23 of Investor Presentation3. Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB): ZS also introduced out-of-band CASB capabilities enabling a customer to scan and enforce policy within sanctioned apps. For instance, a customer can now scan data that is situated in a third-party storage service and determine whether the data in storage will put the customer at risk of exposing confidential data or not.Source: Pg 17 of Investor PresentationZS executives agree that CASB is a natural extension for the company considering it is now commonplace to buy secure web gateway data loss prevention (DLP) and CASB all from one vendor. Out of the products mentioned, I am particularly optimistic about CASB’s potential. Per Gartner, 60% of large enterprises will use CASB’s technologies by 2020, with a forecasted total addressable market of $7.5 billion in the same timeline.Data Center Expansion: The Zscaler platform is also now operating more than 150 data centers, with the latest one opening in Normandy. Zscaler's global cloud platform can thus leverage its scale to perform compute-intensive services, e.g., SSL decryption, at each point of presence, allowing newly detected threats to be instantly blocked across the Zscaler cloud. Further, this data center enables users to connect directly to the nearest ZS data center to be able to take the shortest path to the application or internet destination.Source: Pg 13 of Investor PresentationManagement also took pains to explain the company's competitive positioning relative to Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW) vendors. With the ineffectiveness of deploying virtual firewall appliances on the Cloud, the ZS differentiation stems from its ""Service Edge Cloud Architecture"" architecture, which leverages the 150+ data centers, to allow user access to the internet and cloud services securely on any device or location over the network. The closer proximity helps improve performance at a lower cost for the customer.Further, the company’s relationship with other vendors (such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Identity, End-point, etc.) and the recent partnership with CRWD should also emphasize their competitive differentiation.That said, Zscaler is positioning itself as a key enabler of modern security architecture – with the transition away from the network as the main security hub to cloud security adoption. Whereas ZS is still the leader in cloud security, heightened competitive pressures could lengthen its sales cycle. Notably, customers are becoming increasingly aware of alternative cloud security offerings (e.g., Palo Alto Networks’ Prisma), though Zscaler remains the market leader.In sum, I believe the fair value of ZS shares lies at ~$35.60, using an EV/Sales multiple of 10X – a premium to the average EV/Sales of SaaS companies of 8.2X, underpinned by the above-average growth potential offered by its market-leading position. The multiple-based valuation is predicated on FY 2020 sales of $405 million (upper end of guidance and +33.6% YoY) as the company expands its market share through new product innovations and rising market penetration. Despite the recent pullback, ZS valuations remain lofty, with shares currently trading 34.8% above fair value.After the disappointing 4Q results, management did a solid job of addressing the issues that spooked investors. Several initiatives were discussed, including the partnership with CRWD, the introduction of new products, and the expansion of its data centers. Also, the Zscaler competitive advantage (vs. NFGW vendors) was well-articulated and should appease the bulls. Though overall prospects appear positive, the stock is still expensive and investors might do better to await a better entry point."
4271391,20521,2019-06-20T19:27:53-04:00,Zscaler is not new to the small startup world.It was founded in 2008 and was initially bootstrapped for four years.It raised the first of its three funding rounds in 2012.,"Nearly a year ago, security services provider Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) went public. And what a year it has been. Since then, Zscaler's valuation has grown almost five times, and a slowdown does not appear to be coming soon.San Jose-based Zscaler was founded by serial entrepreneur Jay Chaudhury with the idea of creating a cloud security company that featured a network of checkposts within data centers so that traffic could get directed to the nearest data center for inspection and security. I had met with Jay a few years ago when he talked of establishing Zscaler and to build something significant that had a lasting impact in the market.Zscaler realized that enterprise applications were moving to the cloud, and with more organizations relying on the internet and the cloud for their business activities, providing security services focused on these cloud platforms was essential. It pioneered an approach to security that connects the right user to the right application, regardless of network. Its cloud platform delivers Security as a Service and eliminates the need for traditional on-premises security appliances.Its services saw rapid adoption and the company saw revenues grow from $53.7 million in 2015 to $125.7 million by 2017. During the same period, losses increased from $12.8 million to $35.5 million.More recently, its fiscal third quarter revenues grew 61% to $79.1 million and adjusted EPS was $0.05 compared with a loss of $0.02 per share a year ago. The market was looking for revenues of $74.9 million for the quarter and EPS of $0.01.Among key metrics, calculated billings grew 55% to $84.7 million and deferred revenue grew 69% to $211.5 million.Zscaler expects to end the current quarter with revenues of $82 million and EPS of $0.01-$0.02 compared with the market's forecast of revenues of $79 million and EPS of $0.01. The company expects to end the year with revenues of $298-$300 million and EPS of $0.16-$0.18.Zscaler has been expanding its market reach through partnerships. It recently entered into a global alliance partnership agreement with NTT Communications Corporation to deliver cloud-based Internet and web security to all users, regardless of location, enabling enterprises to adapt to the cloud. According to IDC, the public cloud market in Japan is expected to grow 20% annually over the period 2018 to 2023. Zscaler is looking to capture this market through its latest alliance. As part of the alliance, the two companies will integrate their services to offer a global communication infrastructure that is strengthened by Zscaler's managed security services.Recently, Zscaler also announced the acquisition of Appsulate, a pre-revenue browser isolation company. Boston-based Appsulate was founded in 2016 and is a next generation web isolation platform that renders content in the cloud and sends safe pixels to the local browser. Browser isolation is very useful for security sensitive verticals such as financial services and defense and is most effective where the Internet or application content should not be downloaded to the end point due to security or data protection concerns. Zscaler plans to integrate Appsulate's technology into its extensible platform. Appsulate's funding and financial details are not known. Zscaler did not divulge the acquisition price for Appsulate either.Zscaler is not new to the small startup world. It was founded in 2008 and was initially bootstrapped for four years. It raised the first of its three funding rounds in 2012. Unitl a year ago, Zscaler had raised $148 million in funding from investors including EMC, Google Capital, Lightspeed Ventures Partners, and TPG Growth. In September 2015, it raised $110 million at a valuation of over $1 billion. In March 2018, the company went public and raised $192 million at a valuation of $1.9 billion. It listed its stock at $16 a share. Currently, its stock is trading at $78 with a market capitalization of $9.8 billion. It had climbed to a 52-week high of $80.38 earlier last month. The stock has recovered from the 52-week low of $30.72 that it had fallen to in October last year.Zscaler is becoming one of the key cyber security players that's positioned to acquire a lot of smaller players around its core value proposition. The Cyber Security market is one of the most active areas of startup and venture capital activity. The pool of startups to acquire from is very large. Thus, a hot company like Zscaler with a solid market cap stands to benefit from its valuable acquisition currency. Expect many acquisitions to bolster an already strong product portfolio."
4291209,103480,2019-09-12T13:16:27-04:00,"Shares of Zscaler tumbled nearly 20% after the company released its fourth-quarter earnings results and offered a dim outlook for FY20.
        The company's revenue growth outlook calls for just 30-34% y/y growth in the coming year, implying massive deceleration from this quarter's 53% y/y revenue growth rate.
        Billings growth slowed down this quarter to 32% y/y, foreshadowing next year's slowdown.
        Despite the sharp decline in shares, Zscaler is still trading at a generous 15x forward revenue multiple.","In another illustration of how investors are shifting out of growth into value (even in the technology sector), perennial high-flyer Zscaler (ZS) has suffered a massive fall from grace after reporting Q4 results and guiding weakly for FY20. The cybersecurity company - which focuses on a ""security as a service"" offering that lets customers connect to their applications via Zscaler's secure network - has rarely seen a down day since its IPO in March of last year at just $16 per share. After jumping quickly to $33 on its first day of trading and hitting the ~$40 range by December (despite the rest of the market entering into correction territory), as well as spiking to fresh all-time highs near $90 this July, Zscaler had quickly established itself as one of the most successful software IPOs of the past several years. Now, however, that growth story is quickly crumbling with shares of Zscaler down nearly 20% since earnings, and at about half its all-time highs:The question for investors now: is Zscaler a buy-the-dip situation, or is the worst yet to come?In my view, investors should be incredibly cautious on investing in Zscaler at this turning point in its lifecycle. The company's growth rates (we'll dive into more detail shortly) are flashing some ominous signals heading into FY20 (Zscaler's fiscal year ends in June, so the company just entered its new fiscal year), and despite these warning signs, Zscaler remains trading at generous valuations.Then there's also the well-known fact that cybersecurity companies play in a very competitive landscape, with the differences between vendors often opaque. Morgan Stanley (MS) cited competitive pressures as one of the key catalysts behind the firm's price target cut earlier this week. Especially amid uncertain macroeconomic conditions that may pressure companies to delay IT purchases or stick to well-known names, Zscaler could see weakness vis-a-vis established players like Palo Alto Networks (ZS).In spite of all this, Zscaler's present share prices near $50 indicate a market cap of $6.24 billion. After netting out the $362.6 million of cash on Zscaler's balance sheet, we are left with an enterprise value of $5.88 billion.Here's how that stacks up against Zscaler's guidance outlook for FY20:Figure 1. Zscaler guidance updateSource: Zscaler Q4 earnings releaseThe company is guiding to $395-$405 million in revenues for the coming year, representing a growth range of 30-34% y/y. That's worse at the midpoint relative to Wall Street's expectations of $402.8 million (+33% y/y). At this $400 million midpoint, Zscaler trades at a hefty 14.7x EV/FY20 revenue multiple - which is quite pricey for a company whose growth rate is expected to slow into the ~30% y/y range. Here's a look at SaaS peer valuations in the ~30% growth bucket:In my view, Zscaler's reckoning was long overdue, and hasn't yet gone far enough. Steer clear here and invest elsewhere.The first question on investors' minds: is management's guidance of 30-34% y/y growth for FY20 an expression of weakening end-customer demand, or is it just plain conservatism? After all, revenue growth held up quite well in Q4. Here's a look at Zscaler's fourth-quarter results below:Figure 2. Zscaler 4Q19 resultsSource: Zscaler Q4 earnings releaseRevenues grew 53% y/y to $86.1 million, besting Wall Street's expectations of $82.8 million (+47% y/y) by a solid six-point margin and more or less matching growth rates seen earlier in FY19. Zscaler also noted that it faced a particularly difficult revenue comp in the year-ago period, thanks to a nonrecurring $1.4 million public sector deal that Zscaler won in 4Q18.The red flag emerged, however, in Zscaler's billings. Billings grew 32% y/y to $125.8 million this quarter, the weakest growth rate the company has ever delivered. In Q3, for reference, Zscaler's billings grew at a much faster 55% y/y pace.Figure 3. Zscaler billingsSource: Zscaler Q4 earnings releaseOf course, Zscaler's management has a ready explanation for this billings slowdown, attributing it to a tough prior-year compare as 4Q18 benefited from multi-year deals that were billed upfront. Here's CFO Remo Canessa's explanation on the Q4 earnings call:The question is: how believable is this explanation? If we look at the patterns in Zscaler's guidance, Canessa's story isn't all too compelling. Zscaler's Q1 revenue guidance calls for just 41-42% y/y growth (about ten points of deceleration from this quarter), and its full-year billings guidance of $490-$500 million calls for just 26-28% y/y billings growth.If this quarter's billings weakness is attributed to a tough prior-year compare, then why is management forecasting both revenue growth and billings growth rates to come down as early as Q1 of next year? And if the story continues to revolve around tough prior-year compares due to multi-year contracts, does that imply that Zscaler isn't signing sufficient multi-year deals to keep up with the prior year's longer contract durations?Equally concerning is CEO Jay Chaudhry's comment on the earnings call that big deals have taken longer to close:Coinciding with the hiring of a new president and chief revenue officer (which historically tends to disrupt sales momentum among SaaS companies), Zscaler could be entering the dreaded ""sales execution issues"" circumstance that has plagued several software companies very shortly.There is a silver lining to this potential growth slowdown, however - Zscaler has managed to capture significant operating efficiencies, particularly on the sales and marketing front:Figure 4. Zscaler margin trendsSource: Zscaler Q4 earnings releaseThis quarter, Zscaler's pro forma operating margins shot up to positive 9%, a thirteen-point improvement relative to -4% in the year-ago quarter. We do note, however, that improved pro forma operating margins don't account for the fact that stock-based comp has risen dramatically, especially in the sales org. On a pro forma basis, Zscaler's sales and marketing expenses rose 33% y/y to $41.0 million (slower than revenue growth of 53% y/y), but on a GAAP basis, costs rose 52% y/y to $49.3 million, on par with revenue growth. Correspondingly in the chart above, you'll note that GAAP margin gains have been weaker than pro forma margin gains. Still, it's worth noting that Zscaler has made some strides in profitability. The company's pro forma EPS of $0.07 in the quarter also beat Wall Street expectations of $0.02, and free cash flows for the full year hit $29.3 million (a respectable 19% FCF margin, and nearly 15x what the company generated in FY18).In light of growing concerns surrounding Zscaler's growth, investors should be wary about buying the dip in this stock. Though management is trying to convince investors that this quarter's billings slowdown is due to a poor prior-year compare, we're scratching our heads wondering why next year's revenue and billings growth rates also show a slowdown - especially with CEO commentary on potential deal cycle elongation and executive shuffling. With so much uncertainty on the horizon, paying a ~15x forward revenue multiple for this stock is a hard ask. Avoid this stock until a better price avails itself."
4282632,102101,2019-08-07T12:01:22-04:00,Appliance-based security vendors will pose a strong resistance to market share growth.The Street is overestimating Zscaler's growth capabilities.Zscaler is fielding only one competitive product in a congested cybersecurity market.The stock is highly vulnerable to a sharp growth deceleration and negative knee-jerk reaction in the event of an earnings miss.Zscaler is priced to perfection and the valuation will only cool off from here.,"Lofty growth projections remain priced in as shares of Zscaler (ZS) continue to soar. In the beginning of 2018, the cloud-based SWG (secure web gateway) market was growing at a CAGR of 32% over the previous 5 years with a market share of 26% of the total SWG market while the appliance-based SWG market grew at a CAGR of 5% commanding a huge 74% of the overall market.Investors continue to price Zscaler for lofty double-digit growth with the hope that Zscaler will displace traditional NGFW (next-generation firewall) and appliance-based SWG vendors in the fight for cloud security market share. I believe these projections will ensure Zscaler remains in the overheated valuation range until the growth narrative wanes, thereby subjecting the stock to a severe correction. I will avoid shares of Zscaler currently as I believe future market share growth is already priced in as appliance-based SWG vendors won’t be displaced by Zscaler as quickly as the Street is projecting.Management has been able to defend the company’s growth narrative by aggressively sacrificing profit over market share growth. It was stated in the last 10-Q that investors should not expect improvement in gross margin in the long term, though SG&A % of revenue will eventually come down.Zscaler is able to get away with the aggressive pursuit of market share because it remains the largest player in the cloud-based SWG market. Gartner positioned Zscaler second only to Symantec (SYMC) as a visionary and innovator in the SWG market. Given Symantec’s structural issues at present, there is no reason to doubt Zscaler’s ability to continue to swipe market share even at a huge cost. Since its IPO, the Street has demonstrated its willingness to overlook the lack of profitability in favor of growth. However, when you consider that the broader appliance-based SWG market still commands a larger share of the SWG market, while its yearly growth has waned to 5% over the past six years, it is important to question where Zscaler’s real growth will come from.On a broader perspective, enterprises are migrating to the cloud, and they are questioning the efficacy of their current on-premise security appliances. However, when we take a closer look, we realize that this migration is most peculiar to small and medium businesses. For instance, a big organization like Facebook (FB) or Apple (AAPL) won’t use Zscaler for its cloud-based workloads. Instead, it will purchase an SWG attachment to its firewall deployment offered by companies such as Palo Alto (PANW) or Cisco (CSCO). When you read through its latest 10-Q, Zscaler only refers to the number of Fortune 2000 customers on its roster. Bigger security companies report the share of Fortune 500 or Fortune 100 companies in their portfolio, indicating their ability to win the biggest enterprise customers.This implies that Zscaler’s average revenue per customer is going to come in really low. The last earnings report puts the number at about $300,000. That’s a paltry sum compared to what the average network security vendor makes per customer. At that rate, Zscaler is going to need a lot of customers to surpass the $1 billion ARR mark. Zscaler's revenue per customer is too small to justify that large tech companies are adopting it. I don’t think the Street is putting this fact into consideration.Zscaler currently makes less than half a billion in annual revenue ( $299million expected in 2019), and it's already guiding for more losses in the long term. Also, management doesn’t tell how much the Zscaler Private Access product is contributing to revenue. This is the second major product offered by Zscaler, and the commentary from the last conference call suggests it has not reached the needle-moving size. This puts a lot of pressure on the cloud SWG product to deliver. What is more, the ZIA (Zscaler internet access) product sheet reveals that most of the other juicy services it offers such as SSL inspection, bandwidth control, cloud sandbox, data loss prevention, and cloud firewall are only available as add-ons when customers buy the largest plan (transformation). This isn't attractive for businesses with few customers who want to access all those features.The Street is also bullish on this name due to lack of competition. While it is true that there is no clear competitor in the cloud-based SWG market, the appliance-based SWG market is filled with notable security vendors who pose serious competition to Zscaler. Also, given that the bulk of the cloud security deployments are done on the largest cloud platforms such as Azure and AWS, there is no reason to think that Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) won’t come up with their own security solutions. Amazon currently has a web application firewall amidst other solutions for AWS. Azure also has its own WAF amidst other security configurations.While some will argue that Amazon and Microsoft don’t have the security capabilities of a traditional security company, it is important to remember that they have the cash to acquire the latest AI-security startup which they can easily integrate into their cloud platform. As an investor in cybersecurity companies, I will be wary of getting too exposed to a company that only has one trick in its playbook. Unlike traditional network security vendors that provide firewalls, SWGs, and solutions that cover multiple attack surfaces, getting too exposed to a niche cloud security provider is a highly risky bet.It is even riskier if the said stock is overpriced. Zscaler’s solution only protects a niche subset of the security market, which is data-in-transit communicating with a cloud solution. Data-at-rest and across non-web verticals is beyond its scope and security vendors with capabilities to protect all attack surfaces are more likely to win RFPs given that most enterprises nowadays want a streamlined solution.Armed with the knowledge that management will continue its aggressive and non-profitable quest for market share in the near term, I’ll be wary of jumping in at the current valuation as it's more of a function of growth expectation than core intrinsic value. The current valuation has analysts expecting a 34% revenue growth next year down from 58% in 2019. For a stock yet to break half a billion in annual revenue, I consider that too low. Billings growth has also dropped to 48%, and management is expecting it to continue to trend lower. Given management’s aggressive pursuit of market share, I would have expected billings growth to tick up or remain stable.The SWG market is going to be worth $5.6 billion by 2020, and ZScaler is already trending towards the 20s to the mid-teens growth rate. Assuming the cloud-based SWG market commands 50% of the SWG space by 2020, resulting in a market size of $2.8 billion, Zscaler will have to command the overall market share of the cloud-SWG space by next year to trade in a cheap valuation range which is equivalent to a forward P/S of 3.7 going by its current market cap.This is next to impossible at its current growth rate, indicating that the risk/reward towards more upsides is already priced in. Beating on revenue in the next quarter will only cool off some of the steam. Zscaler will have to do more than 34% in revenue growth next year to sustain its current P/S ratio of 24.Lastly, this is a good time to remind investors about the pending litigation with Symantec: Symantec is citing patent infringement. If Zscaler fails to win the litigation, this will negatively impact its projected margins and cash flow. Zscaler recently settled Finjan (FNJN) after its products infringed on patents held by Finjan. When you bake in all these factors, it's tough to see the stock extending its upward ride.Adding an additional $100 million in annual revenue won’t be a tough target for management to meet. Given that the company is spending more than a dollar to make a dollar, meeting the revenue target might not be an issue. A similar story is Proofpoint (PFPT), which has continued to beat and raise guidance since 2016 without achieving profitability. Also, given that Zscaler more or less has the cloud-based SWG market to itself, there is little room for it to falter.Lastly, its debt-free balance sheet will make it easy for Zscaler to pursue growth via acquisitions if it desires. It recently acquired Trustpath and Appsulate. Appsulate is the latest acquisition, and it's not expected to be accretive to revenue.In the absence of the risks to this thesis, Zscaler is a SELL at the current valuation as I believe the stock is overpriced."

Weaker-than-expected guidance for next year contributed to the negative market reaction.Yet, despite the strong decline in the stock price, I estimate the market overvalues the company.Before discussing the valuation, let's have a closer look at the earnings and guidance.Image source: JanBaby via PixabayResults from the fiscal Q4 earnings report were excellent compared to guidance. Revenue grew 53% year over year and reached $86.1 million, which was 3.7% higher than the high end of management's forecast. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.05, against an expected range of $0.01-0.02.Before the release of the results, Zscaler stock price was already down by more than 30% from its year-to-date highs.Data by YChartsAnd the extra 20% drop during the after-hours trading corresponds to a market capitalization divided by two since July.Guidance for next fiscal year explains a part of the negative market reaction. After several years of revenue growth above 50%, the midpoint of revenue guidance corresponds to a 32.10% growth.Source: Author, based on company reportsThe situation is even more worrying when considering ""calculated billings"", which is a leading indicator of revenue.Source: Author, based on company reportsCalculated billing's growth deceleration is steeper than revenue growth. And fiscal 2020 expected growth of 26.92% indicates the forecasted disappointing 32.10% revenue growth isn't likely to improve beyond 2020. Besides, Zscaler has some other challenges.During fiscal Q4, sales and marketing expenses still represented 57.3% of revenue. And despite the slower forecasted revenue growth, management warned the market about the ramp-up of sales and marketing expense over the next quarters:As a result, management forecasted a small profit during fiscal 2020. But taking into account share-based compensation and some other expenses, which amounted to more than $58 million during fiscal 2019, I expect GAAP net income to stay negative in 2020.The company still has to show it can sustain its growth while reducing its sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue.Even when taking into account a 20% decline in the stock price during after-hours trading, the valuation corresponding to the stock price of $49.10 is still high. The year-to-date share price increase of more than 35% outperforms the 18.85% growth of the S&P 500 index.And taking into account the midpoint of revenue guidance of $400 million and assuming 140 million shares, the market values Zscaler at an EV/Sales (forward) ratio above 16 times.Source: Author, based on company reportsDuring most of the year, the company's EV/Sales (forward) ratio was much higher. But it corresponded to higher revenue growth expectations.Data by YChartsThe market seems to reconsider the valuation of cloud-based, high-growth, software companies though. For instance, CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD) and Zoom Video Communications (ZM) reported results above expectations and lifted their respective guidance. Yet, the stock prices declined and underperformed the S&P 500 index by a wide margin over the last few weeks.Data by YChartsBut Zscaler's slowing revenue growth in the context of high expenses and lofty valuation are valid reasons for the negative market reaction.Thus, considering the expected deceleration of revenue growth and the lack of profits, I estimate the market still overvalues the company at an EV/Sales (forward) ratio above 16 times.The 20%+ drop in the stock price after the company reported its fiscal Q4 earnings above guidance is impressive. The expected revenue growth deceleration despite the ramp-up of sales and marketing expenses justifies the negative market reaction.And despite the market capitalization at half of its highest level over a few weeks, I still estimate the market overvalues Zscaler. The EV/Sales (forward) ratio is staying high at above 16 times.  But the company must still show it can deliver sustainable growth and generate profits.Note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on my latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4247511,104608,2019-03-09T02:05:33-05:00,"Zscaler remains one of the most highly valued security names in the market with industry-leading growth.Revenue grew 65% in Q2, which actually accelerated from 59% in the previous quarter.Q3 guidance seems beatable and the raised F19 guidance still leaves some upside to numbers for the rest of the year.Valuation remains very expensive given the recent run-up in the name; however, the stock looks to be a long-term winner in the changing security market.","Zscaler (ZS) remains one of the higher-valued security names in the market and rightly so. It reported another very strong Q2 earnings report, with revenue growing 65% y/y, an increase from 59% growth in Q1. In addition, ZS also posted EPS of $0.09, which beat consensus estimates for a loss of $0.01. It is remarkable for a company this young and growing this fast to already demonstrate ability to turn a profit in addition to a massive acceleration in revenue.ZS promptly traded up over 20% following its Q2 earnings and continues to tread along at a high-teens forward revenue valuation. I wrote an article a few weeks ago when ZS was trading at ~$43, noting that all future dips should be bought. However, after the strong Q2 performance and pop in stock price, it becomes a little more challenging to justify building a position at these levels. I am confident in the long-term viability of ZS and shareholders should be rightfully rewarded for holding onto their positions.Data by YChartsSince going public back a year ago in March at $16 a share, ZS has quickly amassed an impressive 3x return. The forward revenue multiple has bounced around from low double digits to over 20x, which is well above the average for comparable SaaS-based companies with similar growth rates. The recent Q2 report reinforces the long-term bull thesis surrounding ZS.ZS offers two main products, Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). ZIA essentially is a secure internet and web gateway solution enabling customers the ability to use the internet through ZS in a fully secure way. ZPA provides customers with remote access to internal applications running on the cloud of a data center, with the applications never being exposed directly to the internet (Company website).I wrote an article on ZS after Q1 earnings which went into detail why the stock should continue to be bought at those levels and during all future dips. At the time, ZS was trading at ~19x forward revenue, which was very pricey even considering its growth characteristics and relative valuation compared to other fast growing SaaS peers. Investors who were able to back up the truck on shares a few months ago when they were trading in the low-$30s have already been rewarded nearly 2x.In Q2, ZS reported revenue growth of 65%, an acceleration from 59% y/y revenue growth in Q1 and ~51% revenue growth in FY18. Revenue for the quarter beat consensus estimates by ~12%, a very impressive feat. Even more impressive was billings growth of 74%, which accelerated from 56% in Q1. Billings remain one of the best indicators for the health of the company given ZS's near 100%-SaaS based model. Billings growth remains very healthy and saw a significant acceleration as well as being above revenue growth, which demonstrates continued revenue streams in the next few quarters.Source: Company PresentationThe long-term growth opportunity is clearly present and Q2 growth rates reinforced this thesis. The company's ability to accelerate revenues from Q1 to Q2 is a testament to its potential market share power. Since the company operates in a largely untapped market and has the advantage of being the only pure cloud-based security provider, ZS has the ability to rapidly increase revenues through expanding its customer base.ZS also retained its clean balance sheet, with total cash of $67 million and no debt. This balance sheet gives ZS a lot of flexibility in terms of future growth potential either organically or through accretive acquisitions.For example, in August, ZS acquired TrustPath, an artificial intelligence and machine-learning technology security company. This acquisition will look to ""derive intelligence from transactions processed by the cloud to identify anomalous traffic, build user behavioral profiles, compute enterprise risk posture, and detect sophisticated targeted attacks as they emerge"" (Source: Company Presentation). In essence, this acquisition will use both AI and ML to improve the efficiency and predictable powers of its cloud-based security solutions.Source: Company PresentationGross margin continued to remain above 80% and operating margin improved from a 4% loss last year to positive 13% for this year. This is impressive given revenue and billings both experienced significant acceleration in the quarter. Typically when a company accelerates revenue, this comes at the cost of lower operating margins in the form of higher R&D and S&M expenses.In addition, ZS reported its fourth consecutive quarter of positive FCF with a margin of 16%, improving from a 10% loss in the year ago period. As the company continues to scale and management is able to better control its expenses, we should continue to see FCF to increase. According to the software Rule of 40, ZS's 65% revenue growth and 16% free cash flow margin for Q1 resulted in a score of 81, a very exceptional score.Source: Company PresentationQ3 revenue guidance of $74-75 million remains somewhat conservative, and EPS of $0.01 appears achievable given the past two quarters of positive bottom line. For the full year, revenue guidance of $289-291 million (raised from $268-272 million) largely reflects the strong Q2 beat. Management is likely to remain conservative of revenue growth given how fast the company is growing.ZS continues to remain a challenging name to value. It has a significant opportunity to massively disrupt the cloud-based security market, beating legacy players such as Cisco (CSCO) and Symantec (SYMC). Over the long-term, ZS will become a must-own security name with investors willing to pay up for its value.Comparing ZS's valuation to other security companies is largely unfair due to its much higher growth rate and disruption ability. For this reason, I used other fast-growing SaaS-based companies. My selected peer group includes Atlassian (TEAM), New Relic (NEWR), Okta (OKTA), Salesforce (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW), Twilio (TWLO), Workday (WDAY), and Zendesk (ZEN). All of these names have revenue growth rates of 25%+ and trade at premium revenue multiples compared to the market.Data by YChartsThe average forward revenue multiple of the above peer group is 14.5x, well below ZS. To calculate ZS's revenue multiple, I assumed the midpoint of management's FY19 revenue guidance range of $289-291 million. With a current price of ~$59, this implies a market cap of ~$7.2 billion. The net cash balance of $67 million results in an enterprise value of ~$7.1 billion, resulting in an FY19 revenue multiple of ~24.5x (different than the chart above because ZS is not on a calendar fiscal year basis).The large disconnect between the revenue multiple of ZS and the overall peer group demonstrates the potential disruptive power the company has. When looking at the high end of the peer group, both OKTA and TEAM, which are operating in the security market, trade at revenue multiples slightly below ZS at 16.5x and 20x, respectively.Over the long term, I continue to believe ZS will maintain its leadership position and will grow market share in the cloud-based security industry. Its SaaS operating model will continue to drive a premium valuation and superior growth rate and improving free cash flow margins demonstrate the strength and potential profitability of the company.However, after the big run-up in Q2 and sentiment remaining very bullish around the name, ZS seems to have been a safe haven heading into the quarter where investors put their money in a very strong growth name. Other names in the security software space have not fared as well as ZS, which has caused the multiples to diverge a bit more. For now, it is challenging to make a reasonable case to build a position at these levels. However, when the stock inevitably dips in the future, I would encourage long-term investors to pick up some shares.Risks to ZS include competition from new players or legacy security providers. Its revenue multiple also poses a risk as these fast-growing names typically correct the most when the market begins to turn."
4244051,105052,2019-02-26T08:45:00-05:00,First mover advantage has led to significant growth.This position has ensured a rich valuation.Incumbents in cybersecurity are now able to offer a competitive service.Largecompetitors will reduce growth moving forward.Evidenceof slowing revenue growth is apparent.,"OverviewWithout a doubt, Zscaler (ZS) have technology which has disrupted the industry of network security that has been with us for the last 30 years. In essence, the typical security model involves the use of appliances that sit between the corporation network and the internet. This architecture is often referred to as the perimeter defense model. In so doing, they are meant to protect the data, essential functions and applications of the entity. Of course companies such are Check Point Software (CHKP), Symantec (SYM), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and others have made significant profits selling both the hardware and software for this vital task.As mobile workers and contractors employed by organizations have begun to require access to both data and applications via the cloud, the traditional methods of network security have shown themselves to be less effective, complex and expensive to maintain. The entry of Zscaler with their offering has dispensed with the need for either security equipment or software, since their technology is based on the cloud. This means that remote workers connect via the cloud to datacenters where their requests are validated by Zscaler. In other words, cybersecurity is offered as software as a service (SAAS).The advantages for customers of this SaaS are numerous; savings on network costs, maintaining and replacing appliances and also reduced complexity to name but three. Needless to say, with such a compelling proposition, revenues have grown quickly. Indeed such has been the growth, the company has an exceptionally high valuation. As I shall justify, the company’s share price is more than likely to head south within the very near future.For Zscaler the competitive landscape is changing rapidly and they are no longer the only game in town. Take Paulo Alto Network’s recent purchase of Demisto, reading the promotional material I was struck by the similarity to that of Zscaler. Similarly, Check Point Software have bought the well established Dome 9 to add to their cloud security offering.In short, we have an extremely highly valued company facing the very real headwind of competition from much larger competitors with “me too“ products. These competitors are already entrenched with their customers and are likely to battle hard to keep them.The marketWhen describing products or services for many companies, the task is fairly easy. However, a company such as Zscaler is a tad more difficult for most investors to fully appreciate. In the overview, I gave some brief details of the services that Zscaler offers and I will now attempt to flesh out the offering and the market in which it operates. I also propose to illuminate the many threats it faces going forward.To begin with, let’s take a look at the traditional network security model and compare it to the revolutionary idea that was introduced by Zscaler some 10 years ago.Graphic courtesy ZscalerAs you may imagine from the diagram of the network centric design, for many organisations, there is a requirement for both security appliances and network connections between the various branch offices. When branch offices or mobile users need to access applications or data they must do so via the organizations data center. Needless to say, this requires a hefty bandwidth and there is often an unacceptable latency for the users. Whereas, the proposition that Zscaler can provide requires neither equipment nor software. The Zscaler platform is available on servers around the globe so that all is required is an internet connection to the internet. Herein lies one of the key advantages for companies, a reduction in bandwidth usage leads to a reduction in costs.The next key benefit is the reduction in complexity and the reduced necessity for highly skilled IT professionals. Mobile users are given permissions for applications and data via IT staff. Allocating these permissions is an easy process carried out by nominated individuals within the organization. Once a user has been authorized, the traffic to and from mobile worker’s hardware is monitored by the Zscaler service. If there is any attempt to access data or applications at variance with the predetermined authorization, it is blocked. Furthermore, known hacking attempts and malware are prevented from accessing the organization’s network.Anyone may understand the benefits of providing a simple method of connecting mobile workers or contractors to the essential tools needed to perform effectively. However, this is also Zscalers Achilles heel for the reason I shall describe. During my research, I listened to Symantec’s last quarterly report and one of the vaunted successes for their version of the Zscaler solution was a hospital in Northern Europe. I would guess that this was the NHS in the UK since they also supply hardware to this customer. During the call, the CEO of Symantec mentioned that the hospital group already had such a service and that they had planned to renew the contract with the incumbent so that the roll out of the Symantec service would be made easier. According to Symantec’s CEO, this proved unnecessary as the process of changing was so straight forward. I guess with a fair degree of certainty that Zscaler was this former service provider to the hospital. The reason for my assumption is that Zscaler often, until recently, touted a large hospital in Europe as a customer.Dome 9, the recent acquisition of Check Point Software, has a reputation for ease of implementation. It is possible to read the many positive reviews of this particular product here. Without wishing to sound like a broken record, the ease with which this offering can be implemented by any organization should alarm Zscaler investors. Switching service providers is clearly not so difficult as to be prohibitive.The case of Symantec’s new customer leads me to the second major hurdle that Zscaler faces, and I am indebted to the new CEO of Palo Alto for this insight. Fragmentation of supply of security products and services is a very real annoyance for IT directors. Of course the use of single supplier enables larger discounts to be negotiated. In addition, the notion that a single source of product and service ought to ensure that the whole solution is more effective and work seamlessly together is manifest. Needless to say that the Zscaler solution will not entirely replace the need for on premises security appliances. Therefore, now that Palo Alto, Check Point Software and Symantec can supply a complete solution, they have a grave strategic issue, which is impossible to rectify without a partner.ValuationSearching for a suitable adjective to describe the rich valuation of Zscaler’s stock is not an easy matter. Let me simply say that the stock price suggests a forthcoming stellar performance. If there is even a hint that this will not be achieved, expect a forceful move in the stock price in a Southerly direction.To highlight the fullness of the stock price I will briefly compare Zscaler to Palo Alto using a number of common valuation tools. Why you may ask compare to Palo Alto? There are two reasons; it is a direct competitor and, comparing the forward estimates of growth in revenue, Palo Alto is expected growing at a similar rate.Lets begin by comparing the revenue growthTable produced by author using annual results dataEvident from the table are a number of important points. Firstly, between 2015 and 2018 Zscaler did indeed impress with the percentage increase in revenue. However, the forecast revenue for 2019 is no better than Palo Alto. Upon further scrutiny one can calculate that the improvement in revenue for Palo Alto in dollar terms is more than double Zscaler’s entire annual revenue.This rather lackluster forecast is to some extent confirmed when the quarterly revenue is analysed.Table produced by author using quarterly resultsImmediately noteworthy is the low estimate given for revenue in Q2, which suggests forthcoming unpleasantness for investors in the near term. Also evident is that it is possible, looking at these numbers, to imagine that the market cap of Zscaler is around a tenth that of Palo Alto. After all, the annual revenue is about a tenth that of Palo Alto and the recent revenue growth rates are around the same, right? Well, the market cap of Palo Alto is around $22Bn and Zscaler is approximately $6Bn, about three times more than you might consider reasonable based on the figures above.Lets check out a few other numbersTable created by authorAs you can see, Zscaler has some ugly numbers, the ugliest of which is the figure for earnings per share. Since there are a number of negative ratios and it is a supposedly fast growing company the more familiar ratios such as P/E and ROE cannot be used appropriately. Looking first at the enterprise value to the revenue. For those unacquainted with this ratio, it tells an investor whether the enterprise is overvalued or not. For rapidly growing companies, enterprise vale is more suitable since it adds debt and takes out cash from the equation. From the perspective of this ratio, the lower the number the better. By this metric, Zscaler is more expensive by a considerable margin.Next in line is the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which is a valuation ratio that compares a company’s stock price to its revenues. It is an indicator of the value placed on each dollar of a company’s sales or revenues. Once again. The lower the number the better. For this ratio there is a more than perceptible difference between Zscaler and Palo Alto.If further confirmation of the exuberant valuation placed on Zscaler is required, take note of the final metric, Price to Free Cash Flow. As you may discern, the figure for Zscaler is a staggering 411.3, Phew! Since with this metric the lower the figure the better as it shows the FCF relative to the stock price. In the case of Zscaler, even though the company is growing at a brisk pace, this number is high. Based on the above, I believe it is safe to say that ZScaler is overvalued relative to Palo Alto.I have investigated one further measurement model, the discounted cash flow for additional confirmation of ZS’s excessive share price.Table produced by authorDiscounted cash flow (DCF) is a valuation technique used to give a ball park value of an investment based on its future cash flows. DCF analysis finds the present value of expected future cash flows using a discount rate. Many investors use 10% for their rate, however I have for the purposes of this exercise used 8% as this is the calculated rate of return on might expect with a long term investment in equities. An additional assumption I have made concerns the long term increase in cash flow for both companies, which is 20%. As you can see from the table, the present value estimate has been calculated for Zscaler at $1.31 and that for Palo Alto is $16.53. What does this mean? Well it shows that for Zscaler it is 38 times lower than the current share price whilst Palo Alto is a considerable improvement at 14 times the current share price.SummaryWithout a doubt, Zscaler faces stiff competition for major contracts in the future. The ease with which customers can move from their offering does not bode well. They will have to either lower prices or risking losing business to companies that can offer a solution which includes appliances.Since the company is priced for enormous growth, the merest soupcon of a suspicion that growth will be below expectations will send the share price into terminal decline.OpportunityAt a share price of $50.00 Zscaler is at an excellent price to initiate a short position, either through options or shortable stock in anticipation of future turmoil."

Conservative investors should watch from the sidelines.","Zscaler, Inc. (ZS) is a leader in cloud-based secure web gateway (SWG) services with an astounding 60% revenue growth over the last 12 months. Zscaler was built from the ground up as a cloud-based cybersecurity solution provider and is quickly taking market share from legacy companies such as Symantec (SYMC).(Source: Zscaler)While I generally like the company fundamentals, I find the stock price to be massively overvalued. Therefore, I am assigning a neutral rating and will watch and wait for a better entry point. Aggressive investors could scale in, but I have to warn readers that SaaS stocks are extremely volatile, and I expect Zscaler to have a pullback much more severe than most stocks in the event of a market correction.Zscaler currently provides two services, Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). ZIA is for externally managed applications and replaces legacy perimeter security solutions by moving security to a globally distributed cloud, making the solution faster and less costly. The ZIA datasheet is located here.ZPA protects access to private applications that are located on a private cloud that interface remotely to mobile or other personal devices. The ZPA datasheet can be found here.(Source: Zscaler)Zscaler's management believes there is a $20.3 billion Total Addressable Market (TAM) with plenty of room for growth given the company has total annual revenues of less than $300 million at present.(Source: Zscaler)The landscape is very competitive and includes Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP), Fortinet, Inc. (FTNT), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW), Symantec Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) and Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR).Zscaler has been identified as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Secure Web Gateways for the 8th year in succession.(Source: Gartner)It seems logical to me that high-growth companies should be valued more highly than slow-growth companies. To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value (EV)/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 78 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"" also provided by Portfolio123.The reason for using analysts' estimates is because SaaS stocks tend to make a lot of acquisitions which can muddy the results of the scatter plot. The analyst estimates account for these acquisitions, and the estimates are updated frequently. This makes for a cleaner chart. The sales estimates, unlike EPS estimates, are usually quite accurate for most SaaS companies, except that they tend to be a little on the conservative side.I use an exponential best-fit trendline as it appears to be more appropriate than a linear trend line for this application. As sales growth goes up, the valuation goes up exponentially. The trendline was calculated using MS Excel. I consider the stocks sitting above the trendline to be overvalued, while stocks lying under the trendline are undervalued.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Zscaler is significantly above the trendline, suggesting that its EV/forward sales are much higher than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Zscaler is extremely overvalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the ""Rule of 40"", free cash flow margin and cash burn.A rule of thumb often applied to software companies is the Rule of 40. This metric helps SaaS companies balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's revenue growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has balanced growth and cash flow resulting in financial health.Zscaler had revenue growth of more than 60% for the most recent 12 months, up from 51% in 2018.(Source: Portfolio123)Zscaler had 12.4% free cash flow margin for the most recent 12 months.(Source: Portfolio123)Zscaler's YoY revenue growth was 60%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing twelve months was 12.4%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 60% + 12.4% = 72.4%Since the Rule of 40 calculation comes out much higher than 40%, I conclude that Zscaler has balanced growth and profits and is in good financial shape.Normally when a company fulfills the Rule of 40, I don’t analyze cash burn. But I am providing the SG&A expense here for reference. In the case of Zscaler, the SG&A expense is 89.5% of the total revenues. This means that Zscaler is spending almost 90% of total revenues on SG&A. Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D. The good news is that SG&A as a percentage of revenues has been steadily declining since the company went public.(Source: Portfolio123)I would like readers to be aware of the obscene stock-based compensation that Zscaler is handing out. In the first 9 months of 2019, $34 million in stock-based compensation has been issued, significantly higher than the $7 million issued during the same 9 months of last year.Stock-based compensation is as follows:(Source: Zscaler)And to add insult to injury, the company stated in the quarterly report:Keep in mind that total revenues are less than $300 million, yet the company has given out $34 million so far in 2019 and plans to give out another $155 million over the next 3 years. This level of stock-based compensation is typical of almost all SaaS companies. I expect the exorbitant stock-based compensation to continue into the future. Something needs to be done about this, don’t you think? If you agree with me then contact your local politician or tweet Trump. It won’t stop until there are complaints en masse. It is a great company, but the board of directors is letting executive management line their own pockets instead of the ones that count: investors.Zscaler provides two services, Zscaler Internet Access and Zscaler Private Access. Revenue growth has been superb, coming in at 60% over the last twelve months. The company also has a free cash flow margin of 12.4%. Positive free cash flow is a rarity for a company with such high revenue growth. The company breezes through the Rule of 40, scoring 72.4%. Therefore, I am willing to overlook the high cash burn with SG&A expense of almost 90%.As a side note, there is exorbitant stock-based compensation, but readers will have to decide for themselves whether they can stomach the payouts. It is a game that all SaaS companies are playing and you have to hold your nose if you are going to invest in any of these companies.I believe that Zscaler has a promising future, but the rest of the investment universe believes so too and that is why Zscaler's price is extremely overvalued. In fact, Zscaler is the most overvalued stock in my digital transformation stock universe.I suggest that investors wait patiently for a significantly better entry point before buying Zscaler's stock. Unfortunately, it may never pull back to a level that makes it an attractive investment. For now, I have to give Zscaler a neutral rating. Aggressive investors may wish to scale into a position, but conservative investors should stay on the sidelines as SaaS stocks tend to be extremely volatile."
4247740,98236,2019-03-11T10:18:40-04:00,"Zscaler reported another quarter of outstanding operational performance last week.Growth actually accelerated in terms of revenues and bookings, with bookings growth exceeding 70%.The company reported strong operating leverage - non-GAAP margins were about 15% and the operating cash flow margin was above 20%,.The company continues to achieve extraordinary success capturing large new customers and selling more seats and more transformations to existing users.The company doesn't have any competitors at this point that can match its overall capabilities, although there are a number of entrants in the broadly defined Secure Web Gateway (SWG) space.","Some years ago there was film about Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure. Not the kind of film I usually see, but it had a certain level of popularity when it was released. Late last week, Zscaler (ZS) reported the results of what was its fiscal Q2 results. To adapt the title of the movie, it was an excellent quarter. Unlike some other IT vendors who reported strong quarters, but whose shares didn’t benefit, ZS shares have appreciated since the earnings release, rising by almost 22% before pulling back a little since that recent high point. ZS shares have appreciated by more than 60% thus far this year. They trade at an EV/S of perhaps 17X on a forward basis - even after adjusting for the exceptional operational performance that the company achieved this past quarter and its revised outlook over the next several quarters. Can a reasonable case be made for holding these shares or should investors take their profits and go home? Is this the start of an excellent adventure, or is time to fold ‘em in the words of the famous Kenny Rogers ballad?One of the harder things to evaluate is what investors want from their investments at various points in time. Sometimes hyper-growth is in style and other times people are looking for risk-off trades. Last week, there was a whiff of risk-off in the air after weeks of investors seeking high-growth. I am not going to try to figure out what’s in style today or this week or next month but to evaluate the opportunity to invest in ZS. ZS is going to be perceived as a risk-on, highly valued investment no matter what I might write. I think the risks, other than market risks, are over-rated. Zscaler's valuation is high if one believes that its growth is slowing. Its valuation is far less extended if one believes that the results of its first three quarters as a public entity are representative of its potential. There simply aren't that many businesses that have recorded 3 quarters in a row in which bookings growth exceeded 70%. Needless to say, I espouse the latter viewpoint.There are many investors who simply will not look at the shares of a company with an EV/S ratio of 17X. I frequently speak to investors/subscribers/advisory clients who tell me that their discipline doesn’t let them consider this kind of valuation when investing. I am well aware of the concerns of many that growth cannot last at the rates most recently reported by Zscaler, or that competitors will make inroads into the opportunity this company is exploiting.One of the issues of investing in the IT space successfully is that it frequently requires a leap of faith. My case for making a commitment to these shares, as I try to outline below, is that this company has opened up an enormous first mover advantage in what is called the Secure Web Gateway space, and that the technology it is selling has the potential to replace much in the way of IT security infrastructure that has come before. But there is no real visible analog in trying to evaluate Zscaler because essentially what the company is offering has not been done before. That is the bet one makes in investing in this kind of name - and while it is not for everyone, I think it is a reasonable opportunity based on all I know about the space.I am as aware as anyone that some will think paying 17X EV/S is not a prudent course of action for investors. But I simply believe that quantitative tools are not entirely suited to describe the opportunity for this company. None of us can know today just how much of an outlier last quarter may have been or for how long the company can maintain 70% or 50% growth. I might make some observations regarding specific data points, but the company is plowing new ground - and new ground, by definition has no analogs that can be profitably used to forecast a definitive future.The key metrics of Zscaler’s recently reported quarter included revenue growth of 65% year over year compared to a prior forecast for growth of 47%. The sequential growth this last quarter was 17%. The growth of calculated billings reached 74% and non-GAAP earnings were positive compared to expectations of a small loss. The company increased its estimate for revenue growth this quarter to 53% from the prior consensus expectation of 39% and forecast marginally profitable non-GAAP EPS. The company achieved an operating cash flow margin of 21% and a free cash flow margin of about 15%.The company is now forecasting full year revenues of $290 million; the prior consensus had been for revenues of $270 million. I am not all to sure how relevant the company’s specific forecasts may be. For example, the revenue forecast is equivalent to full year growth of 53% which would imply growth in fiscal Q4 of 39%. I do not imagine anyone who owns the shares thinks that is a forecast which is likely for Q4.Bookings growth is expected to significantly exceed revenue growth for the full year - but is expected to contract significantly in this current quarter. The CFO, on this recent conference call, has called out that the company has had some quarters of very strong bookings from a single large customer. The CFO also indicated that billings growth was augmented by deal terms that were greater than one year. There is clearly a strong desire on the part of company management to rein in exuberant expectations which have arisen since it went public in March of 2018 . But clearly, investors are reacting strongly to 3 consecutive quarters of reported billings growth of greater than 70%, and to strong over-attainment in reported revenue growth and profitability. Billings growth this past quarter actually grew by 21% sequentially, which was significantly greater than management had previously expected and investors have reacted to that kind of attainment by bidding the shares to levels that might seem elevated to some readers.The CFO suggested that billings have followed a seasonal pattern in which there have historically been declines in billings for Q1 and Q3-the fiscal quarter that started on 2/1. And the CFO also mentioned the large booking in Q4 of 2018 that might skew year on year comparisons. I think investors and readers should take cognizance of these factors - but on the other hand, many enterprises will choose contract terms of greater than 12 months in acquiring Zscaler solutions, and enterprise software companies very often book mega-deals; it is the timing more than the existence of such deals that cannot be forecast accurately.Operating expenses this past quarter were at levels that were somewhat surprising in the wake of such a strong revenue quarter. That is particularly true with regards to both sales and marketing and research and development expenses. I never think company’s earn too much money, but in this case, the leverage Zscaler achieved was particularly noteworthy and almost certainly unsustainable. The CFO and the CEO have both again suggested that the company is not attempting to maximize margins in the short term, and given its business success, doing so would be a counter-intuitive strategy.In attempting to build some kind of a valuation model for this company, I have chosen to use a 3 year-growth rate estimate of 50%. That is simply because I will not use any 3-year growth rate estimate of greater than 50%. The world is far too uncertain for me to believe I can know what might happen in the IT world that would allow a company - any company - to achieve a greater than 50% growth sustained over 3 years. There are a couple of companies that I follow that certainly have that potential and this is clearly one of them.If one uses a 50% 3-year growth rate, ZS shares are valued at quite a bit above the best-fit average that I have compiled in looking at the IT vendors in my universe. On the other hand, ZS, in the wake of its very strong cash flow performance, ranks well above my best-fit valuation calculation in relating growth to free cash flow margin. I think attempting to try to reduce the ZS valuation to totally quantitative measures simply misses the point -it's like trying to quantify quicksilver. I will return to the nature of the investment bet one makes for this company later in this article but I want to make clear that trying to use quantitative measures in valuing this investment just doesn't do justice to the nature of the opportunity. A couple of weeks ago, an article appeared in the SA site regarding potential competitors for ZS. The article talked about slowing revenue growth - which is not at all apparent. On the other hand, the issue of competition either real or potential needs exploration. It ought to be apparent that what ZS does is highly disruptive to an industry that has essentially been built on selling a consistent architecture to users for more than two decades.I don’t propose to reprise everything I wrote about the technology in my prior article on this company. It is a couple of quarters on, and ZS has won many customer bakeoffs and the concepts of its technology would appear to be very well accepted by many 3rd party observers, and more importantly by users. As is apparent from the Gartner report that I have linked, ZS remains the leader in the area of Secure Web Gateways. That doesn’t mean there aren’t alternatives to Zscaler's offering or that ZS wins every competition. I have linked here to another study published by High Tech Nectar that isn’t vendor specific. The full article is a bit pedantic, but it validates some of the strategy that ZS has articulated. Finally, the most definitive study I have seen is one published by Infotech. I have linked to that study here. While this study doesn't anoint Zscaler as the leading vendor in the space, what it does make clear is that Zscaler is the segment's only pure cloud delivered gateway that requires no hardware investment on the part of users. That is a major difference when compared to all the other vendors that have been reviewed, and one that is most often dispositive for the large enterprise customers that ZS is targeting. My belief, which I have expressed in my earlier article on ZS, is that as a practical matter at this time, the company has limited competition for the solutions it offers. That is more so in its product area that is called ZPA, or Zscaler Private Access, which is the fastest growing segment of the company’s business. ZPA has reached about 15% of the company's bookings at this point and is likely to become an increasingly greater proportion of the company's business.In looking at competition for ZIA, or Zscaler Internet Access, the devil in terms of its competitive moat, is in the architecture. Basically, while there are competitors who can perform the same kind of inspection of data which is done by the ZIA service in terms of passing data through an external security network, ZIA’s architecture is far more scalable and fully featured. Many of ZIA advantages are a function of the fact that Zscaler offers the only pure cloud-delivered Secure Web Gateway service.The issue that the legacy security vendors have is that their business is based on selling firewalls and other security appliances, and then selling software to go with that hardware. Indeed, it has been a very good business and it was sales of security appliances that drove Palo Alto’s (PANW) notable upside last quarter.It would be surprising if the legacy security vendors didn’t seek to offer users some alternative for the services offered by ZS. But there is an obvious problem for legacy vendors because in doing so, they risk cutting into the highly profitable business they have in selling appliances and all that goes with those appliances. So, the offerings they have developed/acquired are ones based on a hybrid architecture. That is, they continue to sell users firewalls based on appliances for some data from some applications, while using an alternative architecture to inspect data that is routed through their purpose-built data centers for data from some devices and for some applications.The problem is that as CEO Jay Chaudhry put it during the recent earnings conference call, is that what the legacy vendors are offering comes out as a disjointed solution. I do not propose to be an exponent of ZS technology compared to those offered by the legacy vendors-but I think the concept of a hybrid security offering for the web is flawed in a multi-cloud world.I imagine there are readers/investors who will reach a different conclusion regarding the efficacy of a hybrid approach when it comes to security, but the concept of ZIA simply seems to resonate with users who want to abandon the highly complex advanced firewall technology that has been around for basically 25 years or more. Some readers will likely conflate the current ascendancy of the hybrid cloud with the potential for hybrid security architectures. But the issues, at least as I see it, are ones of complexity and management. The security paradigm created by legacy vendors is simply too complex to function effectively in a world made up of loads of mobile device exchanging data from both within and without the firewall. And many users want to do away with managing a complex network of appliances that provide moats for different threats at different locations. The fact is that the legacy technology is based on single tenant architecture - almost obsolescent at this point. The sales story of legacy vendors, which basically suggests that users use a cloud service for mobile and branch applications, but use appliances to mange the rest of the security workload, is just not a message that is going to resonate with most users at this point. The ZS genie is too far out of the bottle.I expect to see the market continue to be entered with a variety of secure web gateway solutions - some from legacy vendors who have to offer something in the space, and other competitors who are basically niche players. Some of the niche players are likely to offer features or benefits that from time to time appear to leapfrog those offered by ZS - but I believe that its first mover advantage, its cloud native architecture and its development strategy are most likely to ward off threats from smaller players in this space. It is, in any event, a huge market - some call out a TAM of $12 billion with a CAGR of 21% for secure web gateways. I have linked here to that study. ZS, looking at its product offering more holistically, and including its offering of ZPA, sees a current TAM of $17 billion. But not all secure web gateways are created as equals and the fact is that most of the web gateways coming to market are deficient when it comes to either capacity or flexibility or the ability to deal with use cases that allow users to access specific apps, without granting those users access to the corporate network.The issue differentiating ZS offings from those of its competitors can also be one of performance. Part of the vision of Zscaler has always been its ability to … well scale. And so, it won the sole source procurement with an unnamed Federal agency that has so far resulted in almost $27 million of bookings and is supposed to grow to an ultimate deployment worth at least $50 million and perhaps significantly more. That is a pretty substantial piece of business for a company whose revenues are just now crossing a $300 million year run rate. The reason for ZS success is that it was the only competitor who could fulfill the requirements of the job. These requirements required a policy engine that could handle 120gb/second of throughput. Most large enterprises, at least today, do not need more than a few gigabits of sustained throughput.One substantial tailwind for this company has been the broad scale adoption of Office 365. Office 365 is going to require substantial investments in hardware and administration because it pushes substantially greater traffic to the web. Using a secure web gateway makes the migration much less onerous than is otherwise the case. The hub and spoke architectures that have historically been used to implement security using appliances can add substantial latency and degrade the performance of Office 365; Microsoft recommends a direct internet connection and that is best accomplished, apparently, using the Zscaler approach.I am not, at this point, going to try to evaluate the ZS Private Access solution from the standpoint of potential competitors. But it is well to note, I think, that one element of the ZS competitive advantage is that it offers security solutions that encompass both web gateways and private networks. Simply based on the data in the conference call script, it is apparent that many of the company's largest customers buy both solutions and that the company has been and will likely leverage its broader product footprint as a significant competitive advantage.I am not going to argue here that appliances and firewalls and VPNs (virtual private networks) are ready for the dustbin of history. But many 3rd party and brokerage analysts have seemingly adopted that argument. What I think can be concluded is that both secure web gateways and Zscaler’s Private Access solution are the leading technologies that users are acquiring these days that have the flexibility and capacity to replace firewalls and appliances, and which have been purpose built to serve modern cloud deployments. At the end of the day, that is why the valuation multiple of ZS, which seems outlandish to some, is far more reasonable given the magnitude of its opportunity. Indeed, while I doubt that valuation multiples can grow, a few quarters of the kind of growth that ZS has been achieving will dramatically impact what seems like an outlying EV/S multiple.Zscaler’s solutions will probably wind up having a lower TCO, but that will not be immediately apparent to most users. ZS does not offer what appears to be a low-priced solution when compared to firewalls and appliances or even compared to other secure web gateways at this point. On the other hand, since it is a service and not hardware, the cost of product refreshes and network management disappear in a ZS deployment, in whole or part. Obviously, the zero-trust solution may improve the security performance of an enterprise, and valuing that is impossible. But in terms of typical cost analysis, outsourcing security to a 3rd party - the Zscaler paradigm - is inevitably going to save money when it comes to indirect costs such as administration, power, A/C and real estate. It is very expensive to for enterprises to run their security solutions so that that they can achieve 5-9’s of availability and the requirement for back-up in terms of hardware and other infrastructure required in traditional deployments is not an insubstantial cost consideration.As mentioned earlier, last quarter was a particular outlier for Zscaler, although I think the outlying was with regards to costs and not revenue growth. While the company added headcount last quarter, it seems likely that it wasn’t enough to fully staff all of its requirements. The sales effort necessary to explain the new paradigm and point out the benefits that ZS can offer its customers is rather significant. Any time there is a major paradigm shift as this one appears to be, the underlying effort to provide customers with the justifications they need to support replacing all of their old appliances, and organizing security in a totally new fashion, is quite substantial and the results last quarter in terms of cost progression should not be taken in any fashion as representing a sustainable cost model.Last quarter, on a GAAP basis, ZS operating expense grew by just 8.4% sequentially, compared to the sequential increase of 17% in revenues. That kind of progression is very unlikely to happen again in the near future, and investors should not expect that ZS will be in a position to generate meaningful profits in the next couple of years. In particular, the sequential growth of 6.5% in sales and marketing expense, regardless of the timing of the company’s major customer event, seems just not likely to be seen again. It also seems likely that the company will increase its spend on research and development faster going forward than it has in the last couple of quarters. At a GAAP spend level of 20% of revenues, ZS spends less on research and development than many other hyper growth vendors and it would not surprise me to see that spend ratio tick up noticeably in coming quarters.Last quarter, ZS reported a 21% margin for operating cash flow. It should be noted that stock-based comp constituted more than 80% of operating cash flow. Last quarter, stock based comp was about 20% of revenues, and was up sequentially. While there can be many discussions about stock based comp, any company that is hiring significantly in the tech world at this time is going to have a relatively substantial level of stock based comp. Still, at this recent 20% level, stock based comp is in-line with other IT vendors seeking to hire rapidly.The largest contributor to operating cash flow was the increase in deferred revenues which actually was 35% of all revenues, a conspicuously high ratio as those things go. Some of that increase in deferred revenue came from the large booking with a Federal customer who apparently accounted for 10% of total bookings in the quarter, but overall, this company has a model that generates a substantial level of deferred revenues. That said, as pointed out by the CFO, the metric can be very lumpy because of the timing of larger bookings, seasonal factors, and the average length of larger contracts. Many other IT vendors have similar difficulties with bookings and have moved away from that metric as a key in evaluating sales performance.From my perspective, it would be good for ZS to feature an ACV metric in its earnings presentation - ACV is a much cleaner way of looking at sales progression than the proxy bookings value - but I have no idea if or when the company will switch to such a presentation although it clearly tracks that data.The company’s dollar based net retention rate of 118% to a certain extent is the flip side of the large upfront bookings that have lead to the rapid growth in deferred revenues. Users are buying more upfront-a good thing, but that makes the dollar based net expansion rate at a lower level than would otherwise be the case. ZS will probably always have more upfront/multiyear bookings than most other IT vendors because of the economics of the ""bundles"" that it sells which encourage a consumption pattern with more up-front deployment. While I expect that ZS forecasts will prove to be unduly conservative, the company has hired a head of marketing and a head of customer experience - a sales-oriented job. It would be surprising if these two hires were not responsible for driving increases in sales headcount and launching programs to expand the presence of ZS in the market. I am comfortable with the company upping its investment in opex categories but investors should be prepared for a significant level of variability in operating margin attainment.I have tried to present a positive case for ZS shares, despite what some will continue to believe is an excessive valuation. But of course there are risks, and while I have tried to point them out, it makes sense to point them out again.Most important, are the risks related to competition. There are plenty of competitors in the Secure Web Gateways space as the Gartner study and the InfoTech study highlight. I think that there is a huge difference between ZIA and its competitors and one that is resonating well with customers. But the legacy vendors with entries in the space such as Palo Alto and Checkpoint (CHKP) are going to continue to make lots of noise as to what they can do and wins they will have against ZS. Competition is and is likely to remain less of a factor in ZPA.Another risk is one of execution. Any company trying to grow at 50%+ is performing a high wire act - and the consequences of slipping can be readily seen in the recent share price performance of Nutanix (NTNX). Selling the ZS paradigm shift and getting users to buy transformation bundles is a major undertaking. Not all sales cycles will be successful. As mentioned, ZS is building up an executive suite to take the company to the next several levels - but inevitably, that remains a work in progress.A real risk is that this company has a record of booking large deals of a size far greater than might be typical for a company of this magnitude. That means that some performance metrics are going to be lumpy and from time to time will disappoint some investors. No company, and not ZS in particular, is going to have any success in accurately forecasting the timing of $10 million+ transactions. Some quarters such deals will happen, and other quarters they will not. And not all investors and analysts will be prepared for the lumpiness.I suppose a 3rd risk, although one that is not high on my list of concerns relates to user acceptance of a paradigm shift. For many years, enterprises have used appliances and firewalls as their protection technologies. Moving to the ZS approach means abandoning what has come before. Those kinds of sales can be difficult, although given the sorry record of breaches and hacks, not quite as difficult as other paradigm shifts I have seen.All of that said however, the opportunity to invest in a technology that is replacing one of the foundations of IT is not one that happens frequently. My guess is that in a few years, the battle between the legacy solutions of appliances and firewalls and secure web gateways will be over, and that the kinds of solutions that ZS offers will become the industry standard. Just how much growth does that mean for how long? I do not purport to make that kind of specific forecast and I really do not believe it can be made accurately. Surely more than what the current printed consensus which calls for 32% revenue growth in fiscal 2020. Greater than 50%, probably. Higher still - I really do not want to guess and that is all such a projection would be. But my conclusion is that ZS shares, even at 17X+ EV/S, are not nearly as expensive as they look. I expect that they will continue to provide investors with positive alpha for a considerable period of time to come."
4254226,104608,2019-04-12T15:16:59-04:00,"Revenue growth in Q2 was 65%, which actually accelerated from 59% in the previous quarter.Management's guidance for Q3 revenue growth of 50-52% growth seems beatable in addition to a profitable quarter.Despite being a great long-term hold, the stock seems to be a bit excessive with high expectations heading into earnings.","Zscaler (ZS) continues to be one of the higher-valued security names in the market and rightly so. They reported another very strong Q2 earnings report in late February, with revenue growing 65% y/y, an increase from 59% growth in Q1. In addition, ZS also posted EPS of $0.09, which beat consensus estimates for a loss of $0.01. It is remarkable for a company this young and growing this fast to already demonstrate the ability to turn a profit in addition to a massive acceleration in revenue.ZS promptly traded up over 20% following its Q2 earnings and continued to tread along at a high-teens forward revenue valuation. However, after the strong Q2 performance and pop in stock price, it becomes a little more challenging to justify building a position at these levels. I am confident in the long-term viability of the company and shareholders should be rightfully rewarded for holding onto their positions.Data by YChartsSince going public back a year ago in March at $16 a share, ZS has quickly amassed an impressive 4x return. The forward revenue multiple has bounced around from low double digits to over 20x, which is well above the average for comparable SaaS-based companies with similar growth rates. The recent Q2 report reinforces the long-term bull thesis surrounding ZS, however, with a valuation near all-time highs and investors already baking in another beat and raise quarter for Q3, I would be a bit cautious around this name for now.ZS offers two main products, Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). ZIA essentially is a secure internet and web gateway solution enabling customers the ability to use the internet through ZS in a fully secure way. ZPA provides customers with remote access to internal applications running on the cloud of a data center, with the applications never being exposed directly to the internet (Company website).After Q1 earnings, ZS was trading at ~19x forward revenue, which was very pricey considering its growth characteristics and relative valuation compared to other fast-growing SaaS peers. Investors who were able to back up the truck on shares a few months ago when they were trading in the low-$30s have already been rewarded nearly 2x.Moving into Q2, ZS reported revenue growth of 65%, an acceleration from 59% y/y revenue growth in Q1 and ~51% revenue growth in FY18. Revenue for the quarter beat consensus estimates by ~12%, a very impressive feat. Even more impressive was the billings growth of 74%, which accelerated from 56% in Q1. Billings remain one of the best indicators for the health of the company given ZS's near 100% SaaS-based model. Billings growth remains very healthy and saw a significant acceleration as well as being above revenue growth, which demonstrates continued revenue streams in the next few quarters.Source: Company PresentationThe long-term growth opportunity is clearly present and Q2 growth rates reinforced this thesis. The company's ability to accelerate revenues from Q1 to Q2 is a testament to its potential market share power. Since the company operates in a largely untapped market and has the advantage of being the only pure cloud-based security provider, ZS has the ability to rapidly increase revenues by expanding its customer base.ZS also retained its clean balance sheet, with total cash of $67 million and no debt. This balance sheet gives ZS a lot of flexibility in terms of future growth potential either organically or through accretive acquisitions.For example, in August, ZS acquired TrustPath, an artificial intelligence and machine-learning technology security company. This acquisition will look to ""derive intelligence from transactions processed by the cloud to identify anomalous traffic, build user behavioral profiles, compute enterprise risk posture, and detect sophisticated targeted attacks as they emerge"" (Source: Company Presentation). In essence, this acquisition will use both AI and ML to improve the efficiency and predictive powers of its cloud-based security solutions.Source: Company PresentationGross margin continued to remain above 80% and operating margin improved from a 4% loss last year to positive 13% for this year. This is impressive given revenue and billings both experienced significant acceleration in the quarter. Typically, when a company accelerates revenue, this comes at the cost of lower operating margins in the form of higher R&D and S&M expenses.In addition, ZS reported its fourth consecutive quarter of positive FCF with a margin of 16%, improving from a 10% loss in the year-ago period. As the company continues to scale and management is able to better control its expenses, we should continue to see FCF to increase. According to the software Rule of 40, ZS's 65% revenue growth and 16% free cash flow margin for Q1 resulted in a score of 81, a very exceptional score.Source: Company PresentationQ3 revenue guidance of $74-75 million remains somewhat conservative and implies a 50-52% growth (compared to the Q2 growth of 65%), and EPS of $0.01 appears achievable given the past two quarters of positive bottom line. I believe the company will be able to beat their revenue guidance for the quarter and will likely raise guidance for the full year. For the full year, revenue guidance of $289-291 million (was raised from $268-272 million) largely reflects the strong Q2 beat. The full-year guidance is also likely to be raised by a similar amount as the potential Q3 revenue beat. Management is likely to remain conservative of revenue growth given how fast the company is growing.The challenging part of this name is valuation. I have been very skeptical at times because of their valuation and just when I think valuation has stretched a bit too far, ZS beats the quarter, raises guidance, and watches their multiple expand. However, I think this time it is a different story. It is very challenging to find any company with scale in the market trading at a multiple comparable to ZS.They continue to have a significant long-term opportunity to massively disrupt the cloud-based security market, beating legacy players such as Cisco (CSCO) and Symantec (SYMC). Over the long term, ZS will become a must-own security name with investors willing to pay up for its value. How much investors will be willing to pay up for the name will always be a difficult question to answer.Comparing ZS's valuation to other security companies is largely unfair due to its much higher growth rate and disruption ability. For this reason, I used other fast-growing SaaS-based companies. My selected peer group includes Atlassian (TEAM), Okta (OKTA), ServiceNow (NOW), Workday (WDAY), Twilio (TWLO), and Zendesk (ZEN). All of these names have revenue growth rates of 25%+ and trade at premium revenue multiples compared to the market.Data by YChartsHowever, even in my quest to find the highest revenue multiple companies in the market, I could not find one at scale that has a multiple in the same zip code as ZS. The company trades at nearly a 7 turn premium to TEAM, the closest peer in the above chart.The average forward revenue multiple of the above peer group is ~15x, well below ZS. To calculate ZS's revenue multiple, I assumed the midpoint of management's FY19 revenue guidance range of $289-291 million. With a current price of ~$68, this implies a market cap of ~$8.4 billion. The net cash balance of $67 million results in an enterprise value of ~$8.3 billion, resulting in an FY19 revenue multiple of ~29x (different than the chart above because ZS is not on a calendar fiscal year basis).Even if we were to expand their revenue growth out another year and use a FY20 revenue growth of 40%, this would result in ~$400 million of revenue in FY20 and a revenue multiple of ~21x. Essentially, this means investors are more comfortable paying for FY20 revenue number for ZS (albeit, my $400 million estimate could be conservative) than a FY19 revenue number for the above peer group.Investors are very bullish around the name, especially in the past few weeks. The valuation chart above clearly shows the revenue multiple expanding significantly after their recent earnings. Heading into Q3 earnings, I would be a bit cautious picking up shares at these levels. I think investors are expecting another large beat for the quarter and another guidance raise.Over the long term, I continue to believe ZS will maintain its leadership position and will grow market share in the cloud-based security industry. Its SaaS operating model will continue to drive a premium valuation and superior growth rate and improving free cash flow margins demonstrate the strength and potential profitability of the company.However, after the big run-up in Q2 and sentiment remaining very bullish around the name, ZS seems to have been a safe-haven heading into the quarter where investors put their money in a very strong growth name. Other names in the security software space have not fared as well as ZS, which has caused the multiples to diverge a bit more. Even with a beat and raise quarter, it is challenging to believe the multiple will expand to north of 30x.Risks to ZS include competition from new players or legacy security providers. Its revenue multiple also poses a risk as these fast-growing names typically correct the most when the market begins to turn."
4229268,104905,2018-12-19T16:10:19-05:00,"Zscaler is on its way to disrupt the cybersecurity space.
        The founder-led company has a strong competitive advantage, is showing outstanding growth and has reached profitability in the last quarter ahead of schedule.
        Comparative valuation analysis shows that shares are not cheap by any means. However, there are reasons to believe that a premium valuation is justified.
        Despite valuation concerns, a long runway of growth and substantial margin expansion potential should make today's share prize look like a bargain in future years.","After seeing two quarterly reports as a public company and closely reading the transcripts to the conference calls, I think it is getting more and more obvious that Zscaler (ZS) is a company that is in the process of accelerating growth – a circumstance that Wall Street typically loves. Strong business momentum should drive shares for two reasons: In the short term, estimated numbers will have to be revised to the upside regularly. For example, while the company is currently guiding for $272 million in full-year 2019 revenues and analysts (according to Yahoo! finance) expect $282 million at the high end, I expect them to get to or even surpass $300 million in revenues for 2019. At the same time, the company has major long-term tailwinds from their disruptive approach to cybersecurity and their competitive advantage as first mover and market leader, giving them a very long runway of growth.What could keep stock appreciation in check at the moment is Zscaler’s steep valuation, which has been a “problem“ since the IPO. Investors have to be aware that – besides execution risks – shares are exposed to investor behavior changes and multiple compression. At the same time, I believe explosive growth of the business – if maintained – reduces the downside risk of shares considerably.I think Zcaler is a company that should definitely find its way into the portfolios of innovation focused investors, even if only at a small portion of their overall portfolio. I expect Zscaler shares to generate significant alpha in the years to come.Since Clayton Christensen famously published The Innovator’s Dilemma in the late 90s, “disruption“ is easily one of the most overused words in investing and business. Of course, everyone wants to disrupt, and investors have been trained to an almost pavlovian proportion to expect huge stock gains, whenever the word disruption is used. Let’s just say that in real life the word disruption is way more used in writing than it actually happens in the business world. Having said that, you have probably already guessed what I will write next:Zscaler is about to completely disrupt cybersecurity.To understand what Zscaler does on a high level, you must be aware of two basic trends that are happening right now: First, company applications and data are migrating from company networks to the cloud. And second, employees are becoming more mobile and need secure access to company resources from any location and device.The problem with the current IT security paradigm is that it is, by design, not very well suited for this changing environment.The most used metaphor to explain legacy network security to non-technologists (like me) is to imagine a company network like a castle and a moat. The castle representing the companies IT network with all their applications and data, and the moat representing an insurmountable obstacle to the castle. To enter the castle, organizations created internet gateways (protected by firewalls) that provide a drawbridge across the moat. These gateways separated the internet from users, data and applications.Furthermore, companies typically build their networks as hub-and-spoke architectures. This means having large, central network headquarter (HQ), through which every IT-traffic has to flow. No matter from where or from which device an employee or third party wants to access company apps and data, he has to get access to the companies network first through the HQ. The network HQ can be pictured as the center of gravity of all IT in the company. Even if not all company applications are located in the HQ (but for example in the cloud instead), it is always involved.You can hopefully already sense some inefficiencies from this picture. One of the biggest problems with this model is that you create huge traffic through the network HQ. Handling this traffic is very complex, expensive and still often produces bad user experiences. It is a classic example of a bottleneck and makes a wonderful target for bad actors trying to do harm (single point of failure). Until now, companies have responded to security threats by adding complexity, trying to make it harder for hackers to infiltrate their systems. But this hasn’t stopped them from hacking. On the contrary, this dynamic has created a rat race, as increasingly complex security threats called for ever more complex and expensive network security solutions.Zscaler’s products are supposed to break this cycle. They are currently selling two products that deliver on this vision: Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA), which is a secure cloud platform where customers can use security applications in the cloud, moving security close to the user and granting a fast and secure experience regardless of location. The other product, Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), is an easier to deploy, more cost-effective, and more secure alternative to VPNs. If this last part was a bit too technical for your liking let me rewind a bit again: The challenge of today's cybersecurity is that employees are increasingly embracing the opportunities to work from outside the office, while applications and data that used to live in the network HQ are slowly moving into the cloud. And here lies the paradigm change in a nutshell: While the center of gravity for the companies' IT moves from the companies' HQ to the cloud, the internet becomes the new corporate network. Zscaler is in the pole position to secure the new corporate network based on the internet.When a ZScaler sales representative comes up to an IT department of a customer nowadays they will promise the following:More security, more user-friendliness, fewer costs and you will help me migrate to the cloud? That’s a heck of a sales pitch.Let’s look at a short real-life example of how this has actually worked out for a Zscaler customer. General Electric (GE) had a very challenging problem: Over their 125-year company history, they have grown into over 180 countries, over 4,000 locations with more than 425,000 users. At the same time, their IT-network has been growing – a lot – and with that, complexity was increasing constantly. According to Chris Drumgoole, CTO of GE, in such an environment “the drawing of the network never gets simpler and the performance never gets better and the cost never goes down.“ Since GE saw that they can’t really secure their network, they can’t afford their network and they can’t scale their network, it started to dawn on them that they actually can’t trust their network, which made it necessary to rethink basically everything. Long story short, they went ahead to remodel their legacy IT network, and Zscaler was an important partner in that process. What was the end result? GE had saved $30 million annually, increased capacity by 35% and improved latency by 80%.No wonder that this company is growing like gangbusters: In the most recent quarter (Q1 2019) they grew revenues at 59%. That is up from last quarters 54% growth and Q4 2018 growth of 49%. Their TTM revenue is currently at $214 million and should get close to $300 million by the end of the fiscal year. Why do I think that?In Q4 2018 Zscaler guided for $260 million full-year 2019 revenue. That was obviously a lowball estimate. In the conference call back then, management mentioned that their total backlog was standing at $398 million at the end of 2018 and after a further inquiry from an analyst they said that 53% of that will be revenue next year. If you calculate correctly, that’s $211 million revenue (or 81% of guidance) that they already made for 2019 in 2018. Fast forward to Q1 2019, and they already guided for $272 million – that's a guidance increase of 4.6%. Will they continue to raise guidance during the year? I believe so. In today’s beat and raise game of quarterly earnings reports, it seems almost mandatory to upgrade full-year guidance regularly during the year. With that said, and assuming they will continue to raise their full-year revenue guidance from the high end of their forecast by roughly 4.6% every quarter, they would guide for roughly $284 million in Q2, $298 million in Q3 and would eventually come in at $311 million in Q4. If they achieve $311 million revenues in 2019 that would be almost 64% growth year-on-year (yoy); in 2018 they grew ""only"" 51%. That sounds like a lot and is probably a bit too optimistic, although not impossible. At $300 million, yoy-growth would be 58%, which sounds more reasonable given the companies growth rate in the most recent quarter.Next to revenue, also billings (up 55%) and deferred revenue (up 68%) grew very nicely in Q1 2019. One key metric to follow is the Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate. The rate compares the recurring revenue from a set of customers against the same metric for the prior 12-month period on a trailing basis. The net retention rate was stable at 115% in 2016 and 2017, increased briefly to 122% in 2018 and now stands at 118%. According to management that is still very healthy since they recently started to sell bigger deals up front and achieved faster up-sells within a year, which can reduce the net retention rate. Nevertheless, they managed to keep their retention rate relatively stable despite this fact, which I would interpret as a very positive sign.Gross margins were at almost 82% last quarter. The company doesn’t expect this number to improve in the immediate future but judging from managements comments in their first two earnings conference calls, it seems probable that they will be able to increase gross margins in the long term. As a side note, the company was profitable on a NON-GAAP basis for the first time in Q1 2019. While Zscaler is not in a stage where they try to maximize profitability, but rather focus all their energy on expanding the top line (which they should), it is certainly not a bad sign to see the company become profitable ahead of schedule. To give a quick picture of the operating leverage they are achieving, let me recite their operating margin from Q1 2017 until now: -15.3%, -10.5%, -14.9%, -19.7%, -18.6%, -6%, -5.9%, -4.3%, 1.9%. Also worth mentioning are their operating and free cash flow, which have both been positive since Q3 2018. Another plus is their balance sheet: They carry no debt and have $314 million of cash in their war chest.Cybersecurity has been a big trend for years and has attracted a long list of viable competitors. However, it seems to me that Zscaler doesn’t have too much to worry about in this regard at the moment. Recently, Zscaler was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Secure Web Gateways for the 8th consecutive year in 2018. Judging from this report, Symantec (SYMC) (through their Bluecoat acquisition) and iboss appear to be the biggest direct competitive threats for Zscaler at the moment (in terms of directly comparable technology). However, Symantec is going through big operational struggles at the moment, which most likely will limit their ability to stay on par with Zscaler, and iboss currently lacks the scale to really hurt Zscaler.Obviously, you shouldn’t disregard big players in the cybersecurity space like Checkpoint (CHKP), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) or Cisco (CSCO) either. It was rumored that Cisco actually tried to take out Zscaler for $2 billion before the IPO, although these rumors were not confirmed. It is safe to say that these companies are aware of the disruptive nature of Zscalers products and will be tough competitors going forward.Will competitors be able to fend of Zscaler and maintain their market share in the cybersecurity space? It is hard for me to make any predictions in this regard, but that is not a necessity to make a good investment case for Zscaler. In my view, Zscaler should do well regardless of the competition as the cybersecurity space is large enough for many players to do well and should only increase in importance going forward. What also speaks for Zscaler is that they are solely focused on their disruptive cloud-security products and also have a head-start to everyone else. Not to mention various patents that protect their technology (although some are currently challenged by competitor Symantec) and their global cloud, comprised of more than 100 global data centers on six continents. Basically, almost every investor I've read from so far agrees that Zscaler's shares are very richly priced. While I don't like to hassle too much on price with small disruptive companies, I have to admit to the fact that multiple expansion is one of the key ingredients of outstanding stock returns, and that Zscaler doesn't have a lot of room to expand in that regard. At a projected 134.5 million shares outstanding at the end of FY 2019 and a share price of 41.22, Zscalers market capitalization stands at $5.54 billion. If you take my optimistic revenue projection for the full FY 2019 of $300 million, we arrive at a forward PS ratio of 18.46. If you back out cash of $314 million from the market cap the forward EV/S is 17.42. That's not cheap.To make sense of Zscalers valuation I find it helpful to look at historical examples of similar cases. One that comes immediately to mind to me is Palo Alto Networks (PANW). The company went public – similar to Zscaler with much fanfare – in 2012. Back then, Palo Alto Networks was slated to be the “Next Generation Firewall“ and, like Zscaler, was about to disrupt network security. Their market value was around $3 billion at the time of the IPO, which computes to around 12 times FY 2012 sales of $255 million. Interestingly, the company’s IPO came on the heels of what many considered a botched Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) IPO, so a successful IPO was not a given. On the other hand, Facebook traded around 26 times sales at their IPO price, giving a very recent precedent to attaching lofty valuation multiples at the time. Anyways, even at a PS ratio of 12, Palo Alto's shares were not considered cheap, as the industry average for its competitors at the time was 5.7 times sales.Palo Alto is a great comparison to Zscaler because they managed to execute very nicely since the IPO – a fact that buyers of Zscaler shares are also banking on today. Palo Alto managed to increase revenues almost ten-fold from around $255 million in 2012 to $2.4 billion today. As of this writing, Palo Alto has an $18 billion market cap, which is a six-fold increase in about 6 years. However, if you look at the share price appreciation from $53 (from the close of the IPO day) to $190 today, that’s ""only"" around +260% or a 3.6 bagger. That's still a good return but reminds us that share dilution is definitely something to consider. As already mentioned, these returns were achieved from an initial TTM PS ratio of 12. If we pretend to have known FY 2013 results at that time (revenue growth of 55% to $396.1 million), we could assume a forward PS ratio of 7.6 at the time of the IPO. Consequently, Zscalers shares – at a forward PS of 18.5 (based on very bullish revenue assumptions) – are trading at a 2.4 times higher multiple than Palo Alto. Compare that to the 3.6 times share price appreciation of Palo Alto over their 6-year public existence, and you can justifiably start to get worried.Did my bullish thesis on Zscaler shares hit a dead end because of these valuation concerns? I wouldn't want to go that far just yet. While a comparative analysis can give investors some insights into what might happen, it is not the be-all and end-all of valuation discussion. There are many factors that come to mind that would support the thesis that Zscaler shares should trade at a certain premium valuation to Palo Alto:If you look at EV/S ratios of other best-in-class enterprise software companies (all have mostly recurring revenue, growing above 50%) you can see that Zscaler has the most premium valuation of the pack. But it can also hardly be seen as an outlier. Another way to try to justify Zscaler's valuation is this: Remember, that Zscaler was trading around 18.5 forward sales. If we imagine a 25% net margin for a more mature Zscaler – which is realistic for a company running on +80% gross margins – we would get a hypothetical forward PE in the low 70s. That is still expensive. However, if we consider the current growth rate of approximately 60% we get to a PEG ratio of around 1.2 – which many investors would consider fairly valued, if not cheap. I admit running number games like this is an exercise that is dependent on many what and ifs, especially for a company that hasn't achieved profitability on a full year basis yet. More conservative investors might call me crazy for that thinking – and maybe they are right.At the end, I can't ignore the fact that ZS is a truly disruptive company with tremendous long-term growth and a great profitability outlook. Cathie Wood, founder, and CEO of ARK Investment Management, recently said that disruptive innovation companies remain one of the most inefficiently priced assets of the public market. I would definitely agree with that statement, although it seems that, if you look at Zscalers premium valuation, the market is trying pretty hard to remove that inefficiency.I would also add that we investors (and most humans for that matter) typically struggle to wrap our heads around exponential growth. That is even more so the case when dealing with high growth rates. Think about it: If a company can increase their revenues by 50% for 3 straight years they have more than tripled their initial revenue base. If they can add another year of such growth the multiple will increase to a fivefold, add one more year and you have an over 7.5x multiplier, and after yet another year, revenues will be almost 11 times higher than where they started six years ago. Am I secretly suggesting that Zscaler will be a $3.4 billion revenue company by 2025? There is no way of telling that. All I'm saying is that compounded high-growth can really work wonders. Investors should keep that in mind when they think of evaluating high-growth businesses.If you are afraid to lose capital permanently because of high valuation and ""the late business cycle"", consider this: If Zscaler can maintain the explosive growth of their business, valuation multiples will naturally contract at a very fast pace (assuming an unchanged share price). Now imagine a share price pull back on top of this ""natural"" multiple compression from growth. Shares would become a lot cheaper very quickly. However, if the business thesis remains intact, shares would probably rebound very quickly as well, because investors are aware of the value (and value potential) of the company. We have seen this play out very recently in the October/November sell-off and the quick recovery following a blow-out quarterly report (compare that to the almost non-existent recovery of most S&P 500 companies). Ironically, a small ""overvalued"" hyper-growth company like Zscaler seemed to have more downside protection than mature and established companies in a turbulent down market.Having said that, I can't deny the fact that companies trading at high valuation multiples are probably more susceptible to investor behavior changes than more conservatively priced companies. Also, if the company would see operational struggles or slowing growth, shares could suffer immensely. Thus, Zscaler's shares are definitely not a buy-hold-and-forget investment. Operational performance has to be followed very closely. So where does that leave us?As a rule of thumb, I think it’s better to get in early into a disruptive growth story (even if only at a small portfolio position initially), rather than wait until the price drops – maybe it will never drop to your preferred level and you made yourself miss a huge opportunity. There are a couple of other advantages of going in early: First of all, this should make you follow the stock closer and make you more familiar with the business. Second, with your added knowledge about the company, you will be more aware of buying opportunities as they come along.If you are a fan of disruptive, founder-led companies Zscaler is definitely one to add to your Christmas shopping list."
4227444,104608,2018-12-10T11:45:33-05:00,"Since going public at $16 a share, Zscaler has quickly amassed an impressive 150%+ return and remains a great, long-term investment.In Q1, Zscaler reported revenue growth of 59%, an acceleration from 54% growth in Q1 and ~51% growth in FY18.Though valuation remains expensive at 18.5x, Zscaler is a long-term winner. The volatility in the stock may provide great entry points over time.","Zscaler (ZS) remains one of the higher-valued security names in the market and rightly so. It reported another very strong Q1 earnings report, with revenue growing 59% y/y, an increase from 54% y/y growth in Q4. In addition, ZS also posted EPS of $0.01, which beat consensus estimates for a loss of $0.05. It is remarkable for a company this young and growing this fast to already demonstrate ability to turn a profit.ZS promptly traded up over 10% following its Q1 earnings and continues to tread along at a high-teens forward revenue valuation. I wrote an article a few weeks ago when ZS was trading ~$42, noting that the current price was challenging to justify building a position; however, after a very strong Q1 beat and guidance raise, I am confident in the long-term viability of ZS and shareholders should be rightfully rewarded for holding on to their positions.ZS data by YChartsSince going public back in March at $16 a share, ZS has quickly amassed an impressive 150%+ return. The forward revenue multiple has bounced around from low double digits to over 20x, which is well above the average for comparable SaaS-based companies with similar growth rates. The recent Q1 report reinforces the long-term bull thesis surrounding ZS.ZS offers two main products, Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). ZIA essentially is a secure internet and web gateway solution enabling customers the ability to use the internet through ZS in a fully secure way. ZPA provides customers with remote access to internal applications running on the cloud of a data center, with the applications never being exposed directly to the internet (Company website).I wrote an article on ZS heading into earnings when the stock was trading closer to $42 a share. At the time, ZS was trading around 19x forward revenue, which I thought was a bit much for investors to buy additional stock. ZS did trade down close to 20% over the corresponding week or so before bottoming out at ~$32.35. Investors who were able to grab a hold of shares at these prices were very lucky.In Q1, ZS reported revenue growth of 59%, an acceleration from 54% y/y revenue growth in Q1 and ~51% revenue growth in FY18. Total billings grew 56% y/y to $64.6 million, which was ahead of consensus estimates for ~45% y/y growth. Billings remain one of the best indicators for the health of the company given ZS's near 100%-SaaS based model. Billings growth remains very healthy and, despite being a few percentage points below revenue growth, demonstrates the company's ability to continually drive future revenue growth.Source: Company PresentationThe long-term growth opportunity is clearly present and Q1 growth rates reinforced this thesis. Its ability to accelerate revenues from Q4 to Q1 is a testament to its potential market share power. Since the company operates in a largely untapped market and has the advantage of being the only pure cloud-based security provider, ZS has the ability to rapidly increase revenues through expanding its customer base.ZS also retained its clean balance sheet, with total cash of $314 million and no debt. This balance sheet gives ZS a lot of flexibility in terms of future growth potential either organically or through accretive acquisitions.For example, in August, ZS acquired TrustPath, an artificial intelligence and machine learning technology security company. This acquisition will look to ""derive intelligence from transactions processed by the cloud to identify anomalous traffic, build user behavioral profiles, compute enterprise risk posture, and detect sophisticated targeted attacks as they emerge"" (Source: Company Presentation). In essence, this acquisition will use both AI and ML to improve the efficiency and predictable powers of its cloud-based security solutions.Gross margin improved to 82% compared to 80% last quarter and was ~200bps ahead of consensus estimates for ~80%. Has ZS continues to onboard more customers, its SaaS-based model enables it to leverage incremental purchases to come on with better margins. Even more impressive than expanding gross margins was the company's ability to generate positive operating margins. Operating margin of 2% was well ahead of consensus estimates for (11%) and was largely due to S&M expenses growing 29% y/y, a 4th consecutive deceleration q/q. ZS was not planning on turning a profit until at least FY20 and though it may not remain profitable during any other quarter this year, investors now know it has the capability to do so in the future.Source: Company PresentationIn addition, ZS reported its 3rd consecutive quarter of positive FCF. FCF margin of 8% improved from a 22% loss in the year ago period. As the company continues to scale and management is able to better control its expenses, we should continue to see FCF to increase.According to the software Rule of 40, ZS's 59% revenue growth and 8% free cash flow margin for Q1 resulted in a score of 67, a very exceptional score.Source: Company PresentationQ2 revenue guidance of $65-67 million remains conservative, and EPS loss of $0.02 to breakeven appears achievable. For the full year, revenue guidance of $268-272 million (raised from $250-260 million) implies growth of ~42% at the midpoint (was previously ~34%), which I believe is conservative. Management is likely to remain conservative of revenue growth given how fast the company is growing.In addition, ZS had a huge billings beat in Q1 and raised FY19 billings to $435 million (~34% y/y growth), an increase of ~$20 million from prior guidance. The guidance raise was significantly larger than the $5 million billings beat in the quarter, further demonstrating management's confidence in the growth of the company.ZS continues to remain a challenging name to value. It has a significant opportunity to massively disrupt the cloud-based security market, beating legacy players such as CSCO and SYMC. Over the long-term, ZS will become a must-own security name with investors willing to pay up for its value.Comparing ZS's valuation to other security companies is largely unfair due to its much higher growth rate and disruption ability. For this reason, I used other fast-growing SaaS-based companies. My selected peer group includes Atlassian (TEAM), New Relic (NEWR), Okta (OKTA), Salesforce (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW), Twilio (TWLO), Workday (WDAY), and Zendesk (ZEN). All of these names have revenue growth rates of 25%+ and trade at premium revenue multiples compared to the market.ZS EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThe average forward revenue multiple of the above peer group is 12.5x, well below ZS. To calculate ZS's revenue multiple, I assumed the midpoint of management's FY19 revenue guidance range of $268-272 million. With a current price of ~$43 and management's guidance for 124 million shares outstanding for FY19, this implies a market cap of ~$5.3 billion. The net cash balance of $314 million results in an enterprise value of ~$5.0 billion, resulting in an FY19 revenue multiple of ~18.5x.The large disconnect between the revenue multiple of ZS and the overall peer group demonstrates the potential disruptive power ZS has. When looking at the high end of the peer group, both OKTA and TEAM, which are operating in the security market, trade at revenue multiples slightly below ZS at 16.9x and 16.5x, respectively.Over the long term, I continue to believe ZS will maintain its leadership position and will grow market share in the cloud-based security industry. Its SaaS operating model will continue to drive a premium valuation and superior growth rate and improving free cash flow margins demonstrate the strength and potential profitability of the company.Risks to ZS include competition from new players or legacy security providers. Its revenue multiple also poses a risk as these fast-growing names typically correct the most when the market begins to turn."
4226901,21815,2018-12-06T21:28:17-05:00,"Terrific company, terrific growth, with large operational leverage kicking in despite being in the land-grab growth phase still.
        It's difficult to assess their competitive position, but within the segment 'Secure Web Gateways' it's strong, but this might very well be too narrow a view of the market.
        Valuation and the market for high-valued stocks at the moment prevent us from giving an outright buy recommendation.
        A dip into the high 20s or low 30s looks a better entry point, should that materialize.","Zscaler (ZS) is an innovative cloud security company that is growing gangbusters and achieved (ever so small) profitability a year ahead of schedule (although that's not going to last this year). There is a lot to say for the company but as the shares are still very expensive, we can only go as far as to say buy on dips, given the climate on the markets for high valued stocks like this at the moment.With the advent of cloud computing, apps and mobile, old centralized security approaches have their limits. Zscaler (ZS) is one of the companies that have developed a new security structure. We already described Zscaler's approach and for those wanting more detail, the company has a handy ebook (Pdf) from the company itself so we will be brief here. One of the main differences is captured in the concept of 'Local Internet Breakout' (from 1310nm.net):They have to basic services:From the Q1CC:On November 26, 2018, Zscaler was named a leader in Gartner Secure Web Gateways Magic Quadrant for the 8th year in a row. ZPA became the first zero trust architecture to achieve Amazon Web Service (AWS) Security Competency status.Management argues that developments are still in the first innings and the company has a very large market opportunity, which is why they are maximizing growth and margin considerations come second.But the company does have a longer term model where operating margins reach 20%-22%, but this will kick in when revenues are in the $800M-$1B ballpark, which is still a couple of years off, at the minimum.The company sells the majority inits Business Bundle, but the most sophisticated bundle, Transformation is experiencing an increasing interest, both from new and existing clients (up-sell). Transformation adds a cloud firewall and cloud sandboxing modules to the Business Bundle. This development will optically depress their net dollar retention rate as it reduces the up-sell opportunities, but this rate still stands at a very high 118%, up even from the 117% in Q4.What management sees at the moment is more customers upgrading sooner, so expect the net retention rate to stay elevated until the up-selling opportunities start to diminish a bit. Keep in mind that there are also further up-selling opportunities:About DLP (Q1CC):Adding seats is especially important for ZPA (ZIA is usually bought for everyone), which usually engages only a part of clients employees, but this number is moving up, from Q1CC:But overall, the dollar net retention rate is probably going to lose some importance as a metric, but stuff like ARR (average recurring revenue) could replace it.The company is selling through SISPs (large system integrators and global service providers), providing over 50% of revenue and the fastest growing channel.The company is also selling through VARs (value added resellers) and this is an important channel generating 40% of revenues (although we suspect at least some overlap with SISPs). They also sell through partnerships with telecom companies in a mutually beneficial operation (Q1CC):But the company is also investing in its own sales channel, hiring some new top personnel like a new CMO and a new SVP and hired 40 new people in S&M overall in Q1.From the 8-K :On a non-GAAP basis the company even produced a small profit ($2.0M or $0.01 per share), one year ahead of schedule. The 59% revenue growth (y/y) also enabled the company to reap really substantial operational leverage, with operating cost rising just ** and operating margin improving by 20 percentage points to 2%. Cash provided by operations was $11.0M (17% of revenue) up from a negative $4.4M a year ago. Positive free cash flow was $5.2M (8% of revenue), up from a negative $8.9M a year ago.Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $314.0M at the end of Q1, an increase of $15.5M from the previous quarter. The company has no debt. For Q2 (from the 8-K):For FY2019:The main risk is the company being upstaged by competition. One of the companies to keep an eye on in this respect is private company CrowdStrike, which supposedly is planning a $3B+ IPO. The company became well know as it's the company that identified the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee servers. It uses AI to offer cloud-based protection that helps clients detect possible threats before a breach occurs. We're not qualified to assess the relative capabilities (for all we know, they could even be more complementary than competing). In any case, Gartner (CrowdStrike website): Zscaler didn't even make this Gartner report because it's not considered a so called endpoint security company, it has its own approach falling under 'Secure Web Gateways.' The field for that is as follows (from Gartner):As you can see, this narrows it down quite a bit but we fear this might offer a too limited view of the market. In the end, what companies want is data protection, by what approach that is achieved is of secondary importance.What is clear though is that Zscaler has a lot going for it, from Gartner:Letting AI lose on threat prevention, that sounds like CrowdStrike (and we suppose a good many others). What's also clear is that there are trade-offs, simply because there are so many vendors. The market hasn't sorted out the winner, but Zscaler's installed base and growth rate does speak of competitive strength.Valuation is slightly less extreme than the last time we wrote about the company, but at over 20x sales it's still hefty, even for a backwards looking figure. At present, it certainly looks like the company is one of the big winners from the shift to the cloud and the increasing security issues that have proliferated as a result of the waning of the old centralized corporate network architecture. It's valuation is still pretty exorbitant, but it certainly looks at the moment that we have one of the corporate security market winners. On the other hand, there is a great deal of potential operational leverage even now when the company is still in the land-grab phase. The main risks for such a high valuation stock is a sudden turn of market sentiment or a slightly disappointing quarter. The other risk is the emerging of a competing approach that outperforms those of Zscaler.Which leads us to our verdict, which is buy on dips."

(ZS) are up about 2%. I think shareholders would be wise to sell at these levels, as the shares are massively overpriced in my view. I’ll go through my reasons for making this claim by focusing in on the financial history here and by looking at the stock itself.While I think the shares are overpriced, I must acknowledge that the crowd can be a bit manic and that the shares may rise in price from here. For that reason, I will recommend a specific call series for those who insist on remaining long. By using calls, it’s possible to still ride the wave of mania with this stock, but in a much safer fashion because much less capital is employed.Zscaler was incorporated in 2007 with a vision that the Internet would become the new corporate network. The company recognized the opportunities and challenges associated with that approach. It recognized quite early on that traditional perimeter security approaches would prove to be inadequate, so it pioneered a new approach to cloud security.The company generates revenue through subscriptions to access its cloud platform, along with some support services. At the moment the company has about 3,250 customers in 185 countries.Significantly, the company expects to incur losses for the foreseeable future, as they continue to invest in their sales and marketing organization and research and development efforts to enhance the functionality of their cloud platform.The company’s service is obviously popular as evidenced by the fact that revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 37% over the past four years. Unfortunately, that’s where the good news ends from a financial point of view. In order to achieve this rapid sales growth, the company has spent massively on sales and marketing (up at a CAGR of 38%), R&D (up at a CAGR of 27%), and the catch all “G&A” (up at a CAGR of 62%). I ran a correlation analysis on revenue and net income and found a fairly strong (r=-.7) relationship between revenue and net income. It seems that the more the company sells, the larger are the losses. The company acknowledges that the losses will continue, as investments will continue to be made. This prompts the question: if growing sales won’t generate positive net income, what on Earth will? I suspect that the company is on a sort of spinning wheel, and that in order to sell more, they need to invest more. If they cease the pace of investment in sales, R&D and the like, they will lose a competitive edge. The company’s own comments about the expectation of future losses exacerbates this fear of a perpetual money loser.Source: Company filingsI think it’s fairly obvious that stocks are sometimes poor proxies for the health of the underlying company. The stock goes up and down in price much more rapidly than the fortunes of the company changes. This disconnect between the price of the stock and the value of the uncderlying business is the source of returns in my view. If we can buy the shares of a business, even a troubled business, at below intrinsic value, we’ll do well. For that reason, I must spend some time writing about the stock itself. While I believe the company is flawed, it’s obviously worth something, and I’ll still buy if I can acquire it at a price below value. Unfortunately, that’s not the case here. Although the shares have come down in price, investors are still being asked to pay ~490 times free cash flow for a share of stock.Source: GurufocusIn my view, paying just under 490 times free cash flow almost guarantees a loss because I believe that the more you pay for a stream of future cash flows, the lower will be your return.I have to acknowledge that my stodgy approach to investing is neither popular nor relevant to a certain cross section of investors. Some investors consider price action alone to be the basis of whether an investment is successful or not. Some investors are willing to ignore losses because of the promise of some future where the company will generate massive profits. This approach has certainly been successful, as evidenced by the massive run up in share price of the likes of Netflix over the past decade. With that in mind, I’d like to offer people who insist on speculating on this name a safer alternative.At the moment, the May 2019 call with a strike price of $37 is being asked at $5.80. I think investors who insist on participating in the future price growth of this stock would be wise to switch from shares to these calls as a way to minimize the risk of the investment. Specifically, for 17.25% of the capital that is employed in the shares, the investor gains access to significantly all of the potential upside on these shares over the next seven months. They enjoy most of this upside while being able to pull 82.75% of the capital off the table. In my view, this is an excellent trade from a risk-reward perspective. This is especially the case given that there’s no opportunity cost associated with a lost dividend here.In my view, there’s very little reason to remain invested in Zscaler. The company has generated ever greater losses as it has grown, and the company itself states that these losses will continue for the foreseeable future. At the same time, the shares themselves are priced very richly, obviously. I think this is troublesome because in my view, the more an investor pays for a stream of future cash flows, the lower will be the subsequent returns. With that in mind, I think shareholders who insist on remaining long here would do well to shift from stocks to calls. At least with call options, there is less capital at risk, and therefore the losses will be lower when the inevitable happens."
4207800,104556,2018-09-24T01:31:36-04:00,"Zscaler is a leader in the web-gate security market.The company's stock has stagnated even though its last quarter's performance was sublime.Zscaler is an expensive company, but its competitive positioning warrants the premium valuation.","Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) reported one of the best quarters I’ve ever seen, and the stock’s response has been rather muted. Therefore, the valuation has become more tolerable.This article will be a look at Zscaler’s latest quarter and its competitive positioning. If you want more of the nitty-gritty business model, see here.In short, Zscaler’s software allows people to connect directly to applications and the internet rather than a network. Gone are the days of logging into a VPN - Zscaler has done away with those. This decreases complexity and costs and increases security. Seems like a pretty good value proposition.The late Phil Fisher, author of the book Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, was a legendary growth investor. He had a checklist of 15 points that he used to narrow down companies he wanted to look at. The first of these 15 points is the company must have a market big enough to grow into for many years. Zscaler definitely checks this box. The company estimates a TAM of $71 billion, since it seeks to replace perimeter security appliances.Seeing as its revenue was less than $200 million for the past twelve months, it looks like Zscaler will not run out of market anytime soon.Not only does the company have a sizable market, it also doesn’t have a whole lot of competition. If you check out the Gartner report, you can see that there are only two companies placed in the leader quadrant. It’s one of the loneliest Magic Quadrants out there.(Source: Gartner 2017)Of course, in this context, lonely is good. But you can see how Symantec (SYMC) became a leader - it acquired Blue Coat. Below is the Magic Quadrant for two years ago.(Source: Gartner 2016)Symantec bought Blue Coat in June 2016 for $4.6 billion. Interestingly enough, that is right around where Zscaler’s enterprise value is today. That may or may not be a coincidence, but it seemingly does give investors a backstop, knowing that Zscaler may at least be that valuable.So here we are, two years later, and one might assume that Symantec is firing on all cylinders. Well, not so fast. According to last quarter’s press release, the company’s revenue decreased 5%. Yes, decreased. Of course, it has more products than just Blue Coat’s, but that dynamic creates a conflict of interest. Symantec’s business includes a lot of network appliances, which Zscaler is successfully disrupting. It would take a massive effort for Symantec to pivot to cloud-only products.One interesting note in the Symantec earnings call was how its management talked about winning a big deal against a cloud-only competitor (definitely Zscaler). The CEO said this customer went with Symantec because of its hybrid architecture. I am not convinced that this space will work like hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI), where the hybrid cloud has become so pervasive. If cybersecurity is cheaper in the cloud, the industry will head in that direction.So this seems to be one of the main points of contention. Will a hybrid structure win out? Let me put it this way, what is more valuable, AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX)? Nutanix might be best of breed, but there is no denying the power of a cloud-native platform. Hopefully, Zscaler will be the AWS to Symantec’s Nutanix.With all that said, the proof is in the pudding. And Zscaler’s pudding is delicious.Gross margins stayed pretty still at 79%, while billings shot up 72%, or 74% sequentially on a very tough comp. Deferred revenue grew 70%, while free cash flow went from -14% in the fourth quarter of last year to 21% of revenue this year - a 35% improvement.Moreover, non-GAAP net losses shrank from -20% of revenue to -4%. The CFO even commented how he and the CEO, Jay Chaudhry, are two of the most frugal people out there after an analyst asked about potential profitability. That’s important because it signals how much demand there is in the market. On the last two earnings calls, the CEO noted how “the market is coming to us.”One thing I was a little worried about was how the expansion rate decreased year over year, from 121% to 117%. It’s not that big of a deal, but fortunately, management commented on it. They said that this quarter, the company saw customers start with bigger, more expensive transformation bundles, including implementation of ZPA, where people can connect directly to applications. This is what has led to such strong billings and deferred revenue growth.Another thing that may have worried investors was the conservative guidance. The company’s 2019 revenue growth estimate was 34% - a big deceleration from 54% in the latest quarter. However, management noted that Zscaler has a backlog of $398 million, of which 53% will be recognized as revenue. This means the company is already guaranteed to have $211 million in 2019 revenue. To hit its guidance, only $44 million in additional revenue is needed. It would be surprising if that target was not easily attained.Right now, it seems like Zscaler’s market to lose, judging by its lead. Therefore, the real risk is overpaying. As evidence, the company's great quarter has pretty much left the stock price unchanged after a couple weeks of wild undulation.Using management’s conservative estimates, Zscaler could have $255 million in revenues for 2019. Today’s market cap is about $4.7 billion, and the company has $300 million in cash on the books. This results in just over 17x sales. This is still not cheap by any means, but it is a testament to how strongly the market believes in its competitive positioning.Of course, there are always other risks, like a recession which could limit IT spending, but we can’t control those things. All we can do is take a good hard look at a company and its prospects and then make strategic investments, keeping in mind the opportunity costs.I’m constantly torn between crawling back to my value investing roots after growing up on Buffett and Howard Marks and believing in the power of technology and how it is so hard to value these hypergrowth stocks. In the end, if there is too much priced into a stock, no matter how great business performance is, the stock price will stagnate.At the same time, Zscaler is no ordinary company. It virtually owns this huge market, and it checks all the boxes I look for. I recommend buying shares or starting a position if you haven’t.Author’s Note: Please scroll up and hit the big, orange ""Follow"" button so you can get these articles before they hit the paywall.

4205104,103480,2018-09-09T06:18:51-04:00,"Zscaler shares have soared after releasing Q4 earnings results, which beat broadly on both the top and bottom lines.Zscaler is racing back toward its all-time highs of $48, which represents 3x gains over its original IPO price of $16.The lockup expiration period, however, is set to occur on September 12. This typically creates heavy selling pressure on strong-performing names.Zscaler continues to trade at an absurd 20.4x forward revenues.","Ever since the first day of its IPO, Zscaler (ZS), the self-labeled ""security-as-a-service"" software company, has made giant waves. Zscaler is one of the only technology IPOs to more than double on its first day of trading. And since then, shares have continued to fly higher. After releasing Q4 earnings results that beat Wall Street's expectations by a wide mile, shares of Zscaler are back to chasing their all-time highs, which is 3x higher than the original IPO price of $16:ZS data by YChartsThe main question for investors now is: can Zscaler's massive rally keep going? In my view, the answer is no - shareholders would be wise to lock in gains now.There's no doubt that Zscaler is a fantastic company. The company offers a rare breed of both high growth and reasonable profitability - for the past year, Zscaler has been able to maintain >50% y/y growth, achieve 80% gross margins, and turn operating cash flows positive. It's rare for a newly public SaaS company to appease investors on both the growth and profitability spectrums.But there are three factors, in my view, that will limit Zscaler's upside:The first and most obvious is deceleration. Deceleration is a natural part of any company's trajectory, and we can't expect Zscaler's revenues to continue growing at a >50% pace forever. However, when Zscaler's growth does tip over, investors may begin to retreat from the stock en masse. Zscaler released its first guidance outlook for FY19 (which begins in October of this year), and the revenue range of $250-$260 million (which is likely a bit conservative; Zscaler has been known to raise its guidance ranges every quarter) implies just 34% y/y growth over FY18's revenue of $190.2 million, and a marked drop from the 51% y/y growth it achieved this year:Figure 1. Zscaler guidance range, FY19Source: Zscaler investor relationsValuation has also been a perennial concern. In the face of impending deceleration from this company, should investors be paying such an absurd amount for this stock? At Zscaler's current share price just above $46, the company carries a market cap of $5.51 billion. If we net out the $299 million of cash and marketable securities on Zscaler's balance sheet, that leaves us with an enterprise value of $5.21 billion.This puts Zscaler's valuation at 20.4x EV/FY19 revenues - potentially the most expensive stock in the SaaS space, even beating out other expensive names like Okta (OKTA) and Coupa (COUP) by several turns. Some larger companies in the software sector, like Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW), trade at 20x earnings. Sure, Zscaler's growth is impressive, but is it worth paying 20x revenues for a company that is expected to grow only in the high 30s and with limited profitability?Lockup expiration in September is the cornerstone of these concerns. In light of the expected deceleration and richness of Zscaler's valuation, as well as the tremendous ~3x gains since its IPO, there will be plenty of company insiders and early investors who will want to lock in their gains when the lockup period is set to expire on September 12, as per NASDAQ. When a stock has risen 3x in six months, it's probably a good time to take your feet off the gas pedal.That being said, it's difficult to argue that Zscaler had a fantastic fourth quarter release fueling its recent rally. Altogether, however, I find the strength of the quarter as well as the FY19 guidance to be insufficient to support Zscaler's expensive stock in the face of lockup expiration risks. Here's a look at the Q4 and full-year FY18 results:Figure 2. Zscaler 4Q18 earnings resultsSource: Zscaler investor relationsZscaler maintained its fantastic >50% y/y growth rate, with revenues growing 54% y/y this quarter to $56.2 million. This result shocked Wall Street, which was expecting a consensus target of $50.7 million (+39% y/y), marking a fifteen-point beat to expectations this quarter.Perhaps what was more impressive, however, was Zscaler's billings figure in the quarter. Fourth-quarter billings rose 72% y/y to $95.4 million, accelerating over the full-year billings growth pace of 65% y/y. When billings growth exceeds revenue growth, it's usually a good sign that revenue growth will either hold or accelerate. The strength in Zscaler's billings lends credence to the assumption that, contrary to its guidance range for FY19, Zscaler may not see a marked deceleration into FY19, or any deceleration at all. Still, however, I find this billings strength to be insufficient to defend Zscaler's high valuation multiple. Even if Zscaler continued to grow revenues at 50% y/y in FY19 ($285.3 million in revenues), the stock would still trade at 18.2x forward revenues.In addition, Zscaler's CFO noted that the quarter's billings strength was due to an upfront renewal from several large clients. Excluding this, billings growth would have been ""slightly below 60%"". Here's the commentary from CFO Remo Canessa on the earnings call below:On the profitability side, Zscaler also made some impressive advances - but again, still not enough to justify its huge valuation. Gross margins improved by two points year over year, but few one point sequentially, to 80%. This is a best-in-class gross margin, and management noted that its current focus is still on investing in the platform, not maximizing gross margins.This year-over-year bump in gross margins also helped to contribute to a slimming of operating losses. Note, in particular, that Zscaler managed to cull down its sales and marketing spend (its largest component of operating expenses) to ""only"" 58% of revenues, better than 65% in the year-ago quarter. Combined with the two-point gross margin gain as well as efficiencies on the general and administrative side, Zscaler managed to trim down its GAAP operating losses to just -$7.9 million, or a -14% GAAP operating margin, vastly improved over a -36% margin in the year-ago quarter. Zscaler's pro forma EPS was also essentially breakeven at -$0.01, surpassing Wall Street expectations of -$0.05.Yes, it's true that Zscaler has continued to deliverer market-topping results, but at a >20x forward revenue multiple, it's safe to say that this outperformance has already been priced into the stock. When a company is trading this richly, even the slightest misstep or quarterly disappointment can send shares tipping over. This is especially true as we cross the lockup expiration period, as insiders will finally have the floodgates open to sell.In my view, Zscaler remains a stock to be avoided. The risk-reward profile is heavily tilted against bulls."
4247679,104442,2019-03-11T05:52:24-04:00,"The digital transformation just begins which opens huge potential for cyber security companies in general.
        Zscaler offers innovative cloud security products with high customer satisfaction and accelerating growth rates.
        Zscaler is a growth company with a high valuation but even higher growth potential.","We are in the middle of a digital transformation, which is leading to structural changes in the world of business and everyday life. New challenges and opportunities such as cloud computing, mobility and the Internet of Things require new information security solutions, especially in the corporate world.While in the past the company's own data centers and servers were the core of the companies that needed to be protected against external threats, nowadays the digital transformation and increasing outsourcing of data and applications to the cloud (e.g. Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform) require new requirements for the protection and access of company data. These are challenges such as:In this context, companies such as Zscaler (ZS) come into play. In particular, they offer companies security solutions tailored to the cloud (keyword: 'cloud security').Old World vs. New World. Source: Zscaler IPO prospectusAlthough Cyber Security is a fast growing market, for various reasons I did not have any shares from this sector in my portfolio so far. But then an IT specialist I knew, who works for a large listed and global company, drew my attention to Zscaler. Zscaler was introduced to his company and he was impressed with Zscaler's security solution. So I put Zscaler on the watchlist and put it out of my mind because I had other favorites on the list at the time.On February 28th I received a push notification from Seeking Alpha with the quarterly results from Zscaler. Wall Street's expectations were beaten. So I looked at the results and the notes of my friend again and did something I don't do normally. I bought the company's shares after trading, even though they had already risen by 15% by that time. On the following day, the share price rose by around 23%. But what was it that impressed me so much that I put the shares directly in my portfolio?Let's take a look at what Zscaler has to offer. In this context, I look at Zscaler's business model, growth, fundamentals, valuation, opportunities and risks.Zscaler claims to be the largest cloud-based software-as-a-service platform with over 100 data centers spread across six continents. In addition, the company would have more than 2,800 global customers, with a focus on larger companies, of which over 200 are Forbes Global 2000 (e.g. Siemens, Schneider Electric, General Electric, Engie). Zscaler currently has over 950 employees and representative offices in New York, Washington, D.C., Australia, France, Germany, India, Ireland, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom.Zscaler's logo. Source: ZscalerThe company was founded in 2008 in Silicon Valley and is led by founder and CEO Jay Chaudhry. Jay Chaudhry owns approximately 22% of the shares according to the 2018 financial statements. The entire board of directors of Zscaler owns approximately 60% of the shares.Zscaler provides a cloud security platform that routes all traffic through Zscaler software to apply corporate and security policies (e.g., specific employee access rights), eliminating the need for a variety of hardware and software solutions that were used in the past. At the same time, Zscaler helps its customers securely migrate data to the cloud.This saves organizations the significant time, complexity and cost they would normally spend implementing and monitoring their network and data security (e.g., hardware, software, IT staff, own data centers, web filtering management, firewall, data leakage protection, SSL inspection).Using Zscaler's Cloud Security solution requires two things: the Zscaler App and certain software connectors that are attached to each server location. Once the corporate and security policies have been set in the system, Zscaler's Cloud Security solution does the rest. Access is provided via the Zscaler app. It ensures that only authorized employees have access to the corresponding applications in the cloud or on the company's internal server and that no unauthorized third party interventions can take place on internal company data or applications (a corresponding product demonstration can be called up here).The following chart illustrates Zscaler's Cloud Security solution:Zscaler Cloud Security. Source: ZscalerZscaler went public on 16 March 2018 at an IPO price of $16. The share price more than doubled on the issue date, closing the day at $33. The share closed at $60.54 on Friday and has therefore almost quadrupled since the IPO.The following chart illustrates the price development of the Zscaler share since its IPO:Zscaler share price performance since its IPO on 16 March 2018. Source: YChartsWhy the share price has risen so rapidly becomes clearer in the next section.Revenues in the final quarter (Q2 2019) rose 65.2% year on year to $74.3 million. What is impressive is that the company is recording accelerating sales growth. Sales growth was 58.8% in Q1 2019 and 45% in Q4 2018.For fiscal 2019, the company issued guidance of $289 million to $291 million. This would represent revenue growth of at least 52% compared to fiscal 2018.The following chart illustrates Zscaler's annual revenue growth:Source: MorningstarTwo other key indicators to measure the success of software-as-a-service companies are Billings and Deferred Revenue. Deferred revenue refers to payments invoiced and received that cannot yet be recognized as revenue because the service has not yet been provided or is due. This is the case, for example, when services are paid for on an annual basis in advance (invoicing on an annual basis is Zscaler's standard procedure). Billings are the services invoiced within the corresponding billing period.Also in these two cases, Zscaler is experiencing impressive and accelerating growth. Billings rose 74% year-on-year to $115 million. Deferred revenue increased 73% to $206 million, which could be seen as an indication of accelerating revenue growth in future periods.In addition, despite the impressive revenue growth, ZScaler is profitable on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter in a row (i.e. excluding, among other things, the inclusion of stock-based compensation, which does not impact cash flow). The GAAP loss was halved from $0.06 to $0.03 compared to the previous quarter. The projections for the coming quarter and fiscal year 2019 also provide for minimum non-GAAP earnings per share.It is further impressive to note that Zscaler is also improving its gross margin as it grows, which in turn may support a highly scalable business model. Gross margin has improved from 73.13% to 80.18% over the past four years (see chart below).Source: MorningstarThe gross margin is therefore better than for other ""high flyers"", such as Shopify (SHOP) (55.6%), The Trade Desk (TTD) (76.1%), Square (SQ) (39.5%) and MongoDB (MDB) (72.3%), regardless of industry classification. Symantec (SYMC) (78.7%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) (71.6%) also have a lower gross margin as direct competitors in the cyber security sector, although these companies are currently much larger than Zscaler.From a qualitative point of view, the CEO spoke in the earnings call about the fact that further top-class customers were acquired across all sectors in the past quarter. Among other things, he spoke of a bank with 100,000 employees that was dissatisfied with the performance of the former Internet security partner and an automobile manufacturer from the Fortune Global 500 (i.e. the 500 companies with the highest revenue in the world). In addition, Zscaler would have outsmarted a potential customer due to its more innovative solution (see following excerpt).CEO Jay Chaudhry at the earnings call on Zscaler's competitive advantages. Source: Earnings Call TranscriptIn terms of the company's balance sheet quality, it is striking that Zscaler had a debt-free balance sheet as at 31 January 2019 with cash and short-term investments of around $340 million. Cash and cash equivalents account for approximately 65% of assets and have a better ratio of cash and cash equivalents to assets than Facebook (FB), for example. In my opinion, Facebook also has a very high balance sheet quality (see following figure).Cash and cash equivalents vs. assets as at 31 January 2019. Source: Zscaler Q2 2019 Earnings Report.With regard to cash flow, it can be stated that the company generated a positive free cash flow in the last quarter and in the last six months. On the one hand, this suggests that the business is scalable and that free cash flow could increase with increasing sales. On the other hand, it could be concluded that Zscaler could finance its growth organically thanks to its comfortable cash situation and potentially increasing cash flow (see following figure).Free cash flow as at 31 January 2019. Source: Zscaler Q2 2019 Earnings Report.In terms of valuation, it makes sense to draw a comparison with other software-as-a-service providers. As already mentioned, Zscaler is not yet profitable on a GAAP basis. For this reason, I draw the comparison based on revenue with companies that have a similar level of revenue or a maximum of $1 billion in revenue (see figure below).With regard to the price/sales ratio, it is noticeable that Zscaler is very generously valued in a peer group comparison. While the peer group has a price/sales ratio of 13 to 16, Zscaler's price/sales ratio is just under 26 (see figure below).An additional consideration of the enterprise value-to-revenue ratio also does not change the valuation ratios (in addition to market capitalization, enterprise value also takes into account the debt and cash holdings of the company; see the following figure).However, it should be noted at this point that Zscaler's revenue growth is also exceptionally high compared to the peer group. While Zscaler's revenue growth is 65% quarter-on-quarter, the peer group's figures are below 60%. Only Twilio (TWLO) can stand out with a growth rate of just under 77%. The graph also illustrates Zscaler's accelerating revenue growth, as evidenced by the steep blue line (see figure below).As already mentioned at the beginning, we are only in the early stages of digital transformation. According to the Gartner Magic Quadrant Report 2016, Cloud Services have grown 35% per year over the past five years. According to an article in Forbes, cloud computing is expected to grow at a rate of around 30% per year to $264 billion by 2027. This would give Zscaler the potential to grow disproportionately in the tailwind of cloud computing (see figure below).Source: Forbes. In addition, Zscaler is partnering with market leaders such as Microsoft and Amazon, enabling the company to take advantage of their monopoly position in customer acquisition (it is worth noting that other cloud security companies are also partnering with these two companies).In addition, Internet of Things ('IoT') is another potential growth market for Zscaler and Cyber Security in general. According to another article in Forbes, the IoT market is expected to double to up to $520 billion by 2021. In addition to smartphones, tablets and computers, cars, motorcycles, bicycles and household appliances will increasingly be networked with the Internet and data centers, which will require additional security measures. Taking Zscaler's ""mobile first"" strategy into account, there is tremendous potential in this area as well, provided the company remains innovative and invests in its growth.Despite the high peer group valuation, an investment in Zscaler could also be rewarding due to takeover speculation. Companies such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google are increasingly expanding their cloud security portfolio. With a market capitalization of just $7.5 billion, Zscaler would be an easy takeover target for these companies.First of all, what impressed me most at Zscaler was the accelerating growth and simplicity of the product in a highly complex area like Cyber Security.I visually compare Zscaler's solution with the departure at the airport. Passengers have to be checked at baggage screening, passport control, body scanner and the last check-in before departure. From a company's point of view, this process requires high costs for software, hardware and staff. Zscaler's solution enables companies to reduce these costs by eliminating many of these steps. Passengers also benefit from this solution because they enter the airport, check in once and then look forward to their flight.The high level of customer satisfaction and ease of use means that customers remain loyal to the company and new customers can be acquired easily. On Zscaler's homepage there are testimonials from customers (e.g. Siemens, Schneider Electric) who praise the ease of use, simplicity and cost savings.Second, Zscaler has a high balance sheet quality, generates a positive free cash flow despite the high growth, and is profitable on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, it is noticeable that the gross margin is improving despite the strong growth, which speaks for a highly scalable business model. With increasing growth, the company could therefore also operate profitably on a GAAP basis in the near future.Thirdly, I like the fact that Zscaler is led by the founder and CEO who owns more than 22% of the Zscaler shares. As a result, he has an increased interest in the company's success. He is also an experienced cyber security manager, having previously founded and managed several cyber security companies. In addition, he appeared to be very skilled and capable in the earnings call and in various videos.A handicap of investing in Zscaler is its high valuation. On the other hand, quality and growth have their price. I think it's better to pay a little too high a price for a good company than to buy a company without growth (and growth potential) at a supposedly low price. There are plenty of examples of companies that are currently plummeting on the stock market in this context.Since Zscaler is a growth stock with a high growth rate, volatility is to be expected. For example, profit taking, analysts' comments, news from competitors or a slowdown in growth can lead to stronger fluctuations from time to time.In summary, Zscaler is still a small fish in a potentially very large pond, the extent of which cannot yet be quantified at the present time. Cloud computing, mobility and IoT are growth markets in whose tailwind Zscaler can grow. Innovations and the development of new business areas could also promote growth. For example, who would have expected that Netflix would change from a DVD provider to a streaming provider? Or Amazon would transform into a cloud services provider?"

4204498,104608,2018-09-06T11:21:07-04:00,"Zscaler remains the clear leader in the rapidly growing cloud security industry, taking market share from legacy players such as Cisco and Symantec.Q4 revenues grew 54%, bringing F18 revenue growth to 51%, an impressive growth rate in a competitive security market.Zscaler is beginning to show early signs of profitability and positive free cash flow.Premium multiple is difficult to justify, but Zscaler will remain a leader in this market for years to come.","Zscaler (ZS) reported strong Q4 earnings with revenue growing 54% and generating an impressive 21% free cash flow margin. Management also provided solid Q1 and F19 guidance, implying revenue growth of 34% for the upcoming year. Despite the positive news, ZS was trading down over 4% after-hours, likely due to investors taking some profits at the current pricey multiple. ZS is the clear leader in the cloud security market as they continue to take market share away from legacy players such as Symantec (SYMC) and Cisco (CSCO).ZS data by YChartsSince going public back in March at $16 a share, ZS has quickly amassed an impressive 150%+ return. Their forward revenue multiple has bounced around from low double digits to over 20x, which is well above the average for comparable SaaS-based companies with similar growth rates. The recent Q4 report reinforces the long-term bull thesis surrounding ZS, however, current prices make it challenging to justify building a position.I published an article on ZS last week talking about the overall cloud security market and where ZS competes. Modern infrastructures and data centers have rapidly changed over the years as enterprises continue to move their operations to the cloud. ZS remains the only true provider of a 100% cloud-based security offering, giving them a significant competitive advantage over legacy players who still require some on-premise hardware in order to operate.ZS offers two main products, Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). ZIA essentially is a secure internet and web gateway solution enabling customers the ability to use the Internet through ZS in a fully secure way. ZPA provides customers with remote access to internal applications running on the cloud of a data center, with the applications never being exposed directly to the Internet (Company website).In Q4, ZS reported revenue growth of 54%, resulting in F18 revenue growing 51% to $190.2 million. Billings for the quarter grew a very impressive 72% with F18 Billings growing 65% to $257.6 million. Q4 revenue growth actually accelerated from Q3's 49%, showing the revenue growth potential of ZS. Since they operate in a largely untapped market and have the advantage of being the only pure cloud-based security provider, ZS has the ability to rapidly increase revenues through expanding their customer base.Source: Company PresentationThe long-term growth opportunity is clearly present and Q4 growth rates reinforced this thesis. Their ability to accelerate revenues from Q3 to Q4 is a testament to their potential market share power.ZS also retained their clean balance sheet, with total cash of $298.5 million and no debt. This balance sheet gives ZS a lot of flexibility in terms of future growth potential either organically or through accretive acquisitions.For example, in August, ZS acquired TrustPath, an artificial intelligence and machine learning technology security company. This acquisition will look to ""derive intelligence from transactions processed by the cloud to identify anomalous traffic, build user behavioral profiles, compute enterprise risk posture, and detect sophisticated targeted attacks as they emerge"" (Source: Company Presentation). In essence, this acquisition will use both AI and ML to improve the efficiency and predictable powers of their cloud-based security solutions.Gross main improved to 80%, compared to 78% last year. The bigger improvement came from operating margin, which improved from (20%) last year to (4%) in Q4. Operating margin was (8%) for F18 compared to (15%) in F17. The significant improvement in operating margin demonstrates the company's ability to not only generate revenue growth above 50% but also work their way towards profitability.Source: Company PresentationAs ZS continues to scale and take market share, they will need to demonstrate some sort of earnings power. This was clearly shown in Q4, with free cash flow margin of 21% compared to a 15% loss last year. For the year, this brought free cash flow positive, to 1%, compared to an 11% loss last year. According to the software Rule of 40, ZS's 51% revenue growth and 1% free cash flow margin for F18 results in a score of 52, a more than exceptional score.Source: Company PresentationQ1 revenue guidance of $58-59 million implies a growth rate of ~47% at the midpoint. Deceleration should be a given considering the already high growth rate of ZS and their bigger scale. Revenue guidance was ahead of consensus estimates for ~$53 million and EPS loss of $0.05-0.06 was slightly ahead of estimates for EPS loss of $0.06. For the full year, revenue guidance of $250-260 million implies growth of ~34% at the mid-point, which I believe is conservative. Management is likely to remain conservative of revenue growth given how fast the company is growing.ZS continues to remain a challenging name to value. They have a significant opportunity to massively disrupt the cloud-based security market, beating legacy players such as CSCO and SYMC. Over the long-term, ZS will become a must-own security name with investors willing to pay up for their value.Comparing ZS's valuation to other security companies is largely unfair due to ZS's much higher growth rate and disruption ability. For this reason, I used other fast-growing SaaS-based companies. My selected peer group includes Atlassian (TEAM), New Relic (NEWR), Okta (OKTA), Salesforce (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW), Twilio (TWLO), Workday (WDAY), and Zendesk (ZEN). All of these names have revenue growth rates of 25%+ and trade at premium revenue multiples compared to the market.ZS EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThe average forward revenue multiple of the above peer group is 13.5x, well below ZS. To calculate ZS's revenue multiple, I assumed the mid-point of management's F19 revenue guidance range of $250-260 million. With a current price of ~$44 and management's guidance for 124 million shares outstanding for F19, this implies a market cap of ~$5.5 billion. Their net cash balance of $298.5 million results in an enterprise value of ~$5.2 billion, resulting in an F19 revenue multiple of ~20.4x.At the time of writing this article, ZS was trading closer to ~$42 in the after-hours, thus implying an F19 market cap of ~$5.2 billion, an enterprise value of ~$4.9 billion, and an F19 revenue multiple of 19.2x.The large disconnect between the revenue multiple of ZS and the overall peer group demonstrates the potential disruptive power ZS has. When looking at the high end of the peer group, both OKTA and TEAM, who are operating in the security market, trade at revenue multiples slightly below ZS, at 18.0x and 17.9x, respectively.Over the long term, I continue to believe ZS will maintain their leadership position and will grow market share in the cloud-based security industry. Their SaaS operating model will continue to drive a premium valuation and their superior growth rate and improving free cash flow margins demonstrate the strength and potential profitability of the company.Risks to ZS include competition from new players or legacy security providers. Their revenue multiple also poses a risk as these fast-growing names typically correct the most when the market begins to turn."
4203668,53922,2018-09-02T18:59:45-04:00,"Zscaler is set for a blowout quarter.
        Calculated billings growth last quarter shows growth is accelerating, not decelerating.
        Zscaler is in a unique position to benefit from increased market acceptance, strengthened network effects, AI tech and its status as the leading independent cloud-based security solution.","Zscaler (ZS) is reporting earnings on September 5th and conditions are set for a blowout quarter. Company guidance is implying 38% revenue this quarter, which marks a deceleration from 49% revenue growth last quarter. If Zscaler does in fact report 38% revenue growth, the stock is in big trouble. But we have several reasons to think that won't be the case.While Zscaler is guiding for revenue growth to decelerate from 49% last quarter (fiscal Q3) to 38% this quarter (fiscal Q4), calculated billings accelerated from 55% growth in the first half of fiscal 2018 to 73% growth in fiscal Q3. This just doesn't make sense. Calculated billings are a good measure of future revenue growth and calculated billings are accelerating quickly. From the company's 10-Q filing:So what is the likely explanation here? It seems to me that the increase in calculated billings indicates that revenue growth should trend from 49% last quarter to closer to the 73% calculated billings growth last quarter. Against a 38% guidance level, management has essentially set itself up for a massive beat, which of course is typical for newly public companies (although the magnitude of the divergence in this case is out of the ordinary).Often the best marketing for new enterprise solutions is actually the hype surrounding the provider's IPO and stock price. For example, general awareness of Zscaler in the market has increased substantially simply due to the press and discussion related to its IPO. A year ago, Zscaler had a fraction of the mindshare it has now, and that's risky for a CIO who is pitching their solution to management and the board. This is particularly true for radically new solutions to existing ways of doing business like Zscaler's cloud security. The last thing a CIO wants to do is push something out of the ordinary that might eventually get them fired. Zscaler, in the space of a year, has flipped from being a risky new security model that a CIO might end up being fired for supporting to the hottest new ""cloud-based"" solution to security. It's easy to imagine that this change in market dynamics will lead to an acceleration in growth rates, which we began to see last quarter in the 73% increase in calculated billings. I believe there is a strong chance that this accelerates even further this quarter closer to 80%+, substantially higher than embedded market expectations that are probably closer to 40-50% growth rates over the next year given the price to sales ratio the company currently trades at.On August 24th, Zscaler announced the acquisition of TrustPath, which develops AI-based algorithms to identify security threats. TrustPath appears to be a fairly early stage company but this shows the confidence and direction of Zscaler management. Zscaler is in a unique position because its clients' internet traffic runs through its data centers, which allows it to address cyber threats throughout its system instantly after a threat has been identified anywhere in the system. This allows Zscaler to benefit from network effects in that the service becomes more value for each client the more clients are on the network. Investment in AI-based threat identification will allow Zscaler to further strengthen this capability and offer a more and more compelling service to its clients.Yes, Zscaler trades at an eye-popping 27 times fiscal 2018 revenues (fiscal year ending September 2018). Assuming a large beat this quarter and a fairly realistic (in my book, considering calculated billings growth last quarter) 70% growth rate in fiscal 2019 and 60% growth rate in fiscal 2020, the price/sales ratio should drop to closer to 15 a year from now and less than 10 two years from now. That could turn out to be a fairly good deal for the largest independent cloud-based security solution in the market."
4228761,103480,2018-12-17T13:06:18-05:00,"Shares of Zscaler have ripped higher and shaken off lockup expiration weakness after reporting strong Q1 results.The company's revenue growth accelerated five points to 59% y/y, making Zscaler one of the fastest-growing companies in the SaaS sector.The company also slimmed down its losses and achieved positive free cash flows.Despite these strengths, Zscaler's towering $5 billion market cap and valuation at ~18x forward revenues heavily caps its upside.","Ever since its IPO earlier in 2018, Zscaler (ZS) has continued to be one of the hottest trades in the software sector. The self-dubbed ""security-as-a-service"" provider, which sells a variety of firewall applications and access management tools, has clearly distinguished itself as one of the fastest-growing companies in cybersecurity and one of the best-performing software IPOs of the year. The company looks rock-solid from both a qualitative and financial front. Just a few weeks ago, Zscaler was named one of two Leaders in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Secure Web Gateways, right alongside longtime incumbent Symantec (SYMC). Zscaler has been named a Leader in this space for eight years in a row. The fact that Gartner - often recognized as the most authoritative reviewer in the software industry - has deemed Zscaler as virtually an equal to a longtime security leader that is four times as old and more than ten times larger (on a revenue basis) is truly impressive. Note also that Zscaler occupies a much higher ranking than other security stalwarts such as McAfee and Barracuda Networks (CUDA).Figure 1. Zscaler's Gartner rankingSource: Zscaler press releaseZscaler's quarterly results have proven that its product strengths have translated into growth as well. The company just released first-quarter results that showed both an acceleration in revenue growth as well as a slimming of losses and improved cash flows. Zscaler, unlike many of its high-growth contemporaries, is not a ""growth-at-all-costs"" company - it has struck a strong balance between growth and profitability as it scales. This being said, however, the company's strengths and its attractiveness as an investment at current levels are somewhat different situations, separated by one factor: valuation. In my view, Zscaler's persistently rich valuation limits its upside in 2019, and investors should take care to lock in gains as volatility persists. There are many who would assert that for a strong-performing company like Zscaler in a huge space that valuation ""doesn't matter,"" and that a company performing this well must necessarily see a corresponding rise in share prices.I find this assertion rather misinformed. At present, Zscaler's market cap sits at $5.19 billion - are there investors or companies who would be willing to buy pieces of Zscaler, or all of it, at a market cap of $35 billion? That's roughly the size of Workday (WDAY), a company that is ~10x Zscaler's size and is also far more profitable.Probably not. And because of this, valuation does matter. And unfortunately, Zscaler's valuation at the moment exceeds virtually every other company in the SaaS sector. A quick check on where the stock is currently trading: as previously mentioned, Zscaler's market cap is currently at $5.19 billion; after netting out $314.1 million of cash, the company has an enterprise value of $4.88 billion. Figure 2. Zscaler FY19 guidanceSource: Zscaler Q1 earnings releaseFor the current fiscal year that just kicked off with Zscaler's December earnings release, Zscaler has guided to revenues of $268-$272 million, which implies 42% y/y revenue growth at the midpoint over FY18's revenues of $190.2 million. This also indicates that Zscaler is currently trading at 18.1x EV/FY19 revenues. There are technology companies that are trading at lower multiples of GAAP earnings than Zscaler is trading as a multiple of revenues. In my mind, that's a stark reminder of how expensive Zscaler has become. There's no doubt that the company's >50% revenue growth (at least so far; if we believe its revenue guidance, the company will see deceleration into the 40s this year) afford Zscaler a bit of a premium, but not by this much. For comparison, here's a look at where some of the other perennially expensive software names are trading - the only high-growth stock that rivals Zscaler is Okta, the single sign-on vendor which has a similar near-60% revenue growth rate:COUP EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsNote also that despite the S&P500 and the NASDAQ entering correction territory, with many growth stocks at 30-40% below their peak values, Zscaler has barely lost any momentum. Relative to its all-time high of $48, Zscaler has barely lost 10% from peak values. ZS data by YChartsIt's true that valuation is often a secondary concern when markets are in bullish mode and investors are dumping money into the fastest-growing stocks with little regard for profitability or for relative valuation. But as markets have begun to show signs of weakness in the ten-year bull run, investors will be far more cautious about pumping up a new IPO that, for all its strengths, has yet to deliver a penny of GAAP profits. Though poor market sentiment has not yet affected Zscaler, I believe the downturn will catch up to it. At these heightened levels, Zscaler has far more risk to the downside than to the upside. That being said, we do have to acknowledge that Zscaler's strong results lend a bit of merit to holding the stock afloat. Zscaler produced tremendously strong Q1 results in an earnings season where many investors disappointed. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 3. Zscaler 1Q19 resultsSource: Zscaler Q1 earnings releaseRevenues grew 59% y/y to $63.3 million, completely crushing Wall Street's expectations of $58.7 million (+47% y/y) by a huge twelve-point beat margin. Perhaps even more impressively, Zscaler managed to accelerate its revenue growth by five points sequentially relative to 54% y/y growth in the previous quarter. For a company that is growing at this blinding rate, any level of acceleration is hugely commendable. Jay Chaudhry, Zscaler's CEO, attributed this quarter's beat to a quick ramp of Zscaler's sales efforts. Per his prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call:Remo Canessa, Zscaler's CFO, also added that the company grew billings at 56% y/y to $64.6 million, thereby expanding Zscaler's backlog to $411 million (up nearly 2x year-over-year). Like many SaaS companies, Zscaler bills customers upfront for one year of service, so before these deals show up as revenues, they appear first as backlog. The continued buildup of Zscaler's deferred revenue backlog is yet another indicator of the company's robust growth trajectory. Even better, the company noted that it managed to bump up its dollar-based net retention rate to 118%, up two points relative to 116% in the year-ago quarter. Because upsells into the existing installed base most often cost far less in sales dollars to achieve than new business, the fact that Zscaler's existing customers tend to purchase larger subscriptions over time is a huge positive for margins.As such, Zscaler achieved significant progress on closing its losses and improving its margins this quarter, as shown in the table below:Figure 4. Zscaler margin trendsSource: Zscaler Q1 earnings releaseGAAP gross margins ticked up two points to 81%, also putting Zscaler in the upper echelon of gross margin profiles within the software industry (a mid-70s GAAP gross margin is more the norm in the sector).In addition, thanks to strong net retention and upsell activity, Zscaler managed to push down its cost of sales and marketing as a percentage of revenues - this quarter, sales and marketing expenses of $36.6 million consumed 58% of revenues, down from 68% in the year-ago quarter. The company also achieved operating leverage on general and administrative costs, which consumed 16% of revenues this quarter versus 18% in the year-ago quarter. Combined with the gross margin gains, this helped Zscaler to improve GAAP operating margins by fourteen points to -14%. Should profitability gains continue at this pace, Zscaler could hit GAAP profitability within one or two years. Pro forma EPS also hit positive $0.01 this quarter, six cents better than consensus of -$0.05. Zscaler also managed to hit $5.2 million in positive free cash flows this quarter, up sharply from a loss of -$8.9 million in the year-ago quarter and eking out an FCF margin of 8%.Figure 5. Zscaler FCFSource: Zscaler Q1 earnings releaseThere's little doubt that Zscaler has established a track record for extremely strong financial performance that spans across both growth and profitability. The company's ability to close its loss gap will be an important factor in sustaining its share price during volatile market conditions, as investors continue to turn their backs away from ""loss leaders"" that don't show a path to breakeven. It's difficult to remain bullish on Zscaler, however, at its present valuation. All of the company's outperformance has been substantially baked into a rich ~18x forward revenue multiple, and with Zscaler shares having barely lost any value since the autumn rout, I fear that correction forces will catch up to the company.Recall that Zscaler's lockup expiration period ended in September, meaning company insiders are free to unload their shares. With Zscaler stock having performed relatively well over 2018, many large holders may choose to lock in their gains in January, to defer paying capital gains for an additional year. In my view, Zscaler's outlandish valuation and the tendency to lock in profits when the market is shaky will put pressure on Zscaler in early 2019. Despite remarkably strong performance, I'd choose to stay on the sidelines until Zscaler cools down alongside struggling SaaS peers."
4203341,104608,2018-08-31T05:15:14-04:00,Zscaler is the clear leader and winner in cloud-based security and is off to a hot start since going public earlier this year.Q3 results were very strong with current guidance implying 38% revenue growth in Q4 and 47% for the full year.Current valuations are a bit extended with investors willing to pay over 12x F20 aggressive revenue estimates.,"Zscaler (ZS) reports its Q4 earnings on September 5th, and though I expect a strong earnings report and likely solid guide for F19, valuation has risen to extreme levels. Investors should be cautious heading into earnings and realize what multiple they must pay in order to own this name. Despite being the clear leader in cloud security, winning market share over legacy players, Symantec (SYMC) and Cisco (CSCO), ZS still has a while before the valuation becomes more realistic.ZS data by YChartsZS is one of the newer security companies to go public and represents one of the richest valuations of any SaaS-based company. The forward revenue multiple of nearly 20x is well above the average for other SaaS-based companies with comparable growth rates. With Q4 earnings and a new F19 guide on the horizon, investors should take a slightly more cautious approach.Modern infrastructure and data centers have changed drastically over the years especially as enterprises continue to adapt to more software-centric applications. In the past, an enterprise's data center was hosted entirely on premise with all security parameters hosted around the physical location of that data center. However, as infrastructure has moved away from the traditional ""perimeter around the data center"" to a more expansive and global method, the need and usage of cloud-based security offerings has increased.Enter ZS. Enterprises need to constantly ensure each application is secure at the perimeter, wherever that perimeter may be. Rather than hosting hundreds of security applications throughout an enterprise's data center, cloud-based solutions enable complete security over the new infrastructure. ZS has a 100% cloud-built secure platform, enabling enterprises to secure all points of their infrastructure.This is a key point to ZS's thesis as it is the only pure-play provider of cloud-based security solutions. Its main competitors in this area are legacy players, Symantec (Blue Coat) and Cisco. I have written previous articles on CSCO going through its transition to a more software-focused operations with an enhanced security offering; however, there remains a wide gap between ZS and the two legacy companies. ZS is the only true provider of a 100% cloud-based offering, giving it a significant competitive advantage.One of ZS's best customer examples is Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), which uses ZS's products to secure its 350,000+ global users across 180 countries (Company website). Rather than having hardware present at each employee location to secure their infrastructure and network, ZS's cloud-based offerings do this for them. As more enterprises become global in nature, the need for secure cloud-based security solutions will rapidly increase, feeding directly into ZS's TAM and eventual revenue stream.ZS offers two main products, Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). ZIA essentially is a secure internet and web gateway solution enabling customers the ability to use the Internet through ZS in a fully secure way. ZPA provides customers with remote access to internal applications running on the cloud of data center, with the applications never being exposed directly to the Internet (Company website).In Q3, which was reported in early June, ZS reported revenue growth of 49% with billings growing 73% and deferred revenue growing 61%. This was the company's first quarter reporting as a public company, and it made a great showing. ZS's stock has performed exceptionally well since going public at $16 a share, largely due to investors believing in the long-term growth opportunity.ZS also has an impressive net cash balance of $287 million, which provides the company the opportunity to internally fund cash flows and expenses as it significantly ramps its R&D and S&M costs. Gross margins were an impressive 81% for the quarter, improving from 79% last year, with operating margins also improving to (6%) compared to (15%) last year.Source: Company WebsiteAlso, ZS was able to generate positive FCF of nearly $4 million which, while is small in magnitude, represents great progress from the $2 million loss last year. FCF margin improved to 7% compared to (5%) last year.Management also provided guidance for the upcoming Q4 results and F18 totals. It expects Q4 revenue of $50-51 million (38% growth at the midpoint) with an operating loss of $6-7 million (margin of ~12-13%). For the full year, management expects revenue of $184-185 million (~47% growth at the midpoint) with an operating loss of $19-20 million (margin of ~10-11%).Source: Company WebsiteI believe ZS will beat revenue guidance by a decent amount, with slight gross and operating margin expansion. Investors expect a decent beat this quarter along with a strong guide for next year. I believe a guide below 35-40% revenue growth may send the shares down.ZS is a very challenging name to assign a fair value. Given its opportunity to massively disrupt the cloud-based security market, investors are more than willing to pay up for this name. Over the long-run, I believe ZS is a great security name to own and even has the potential to be taken out by a legacy security player, though this is purely my speculation.Rather than comparing the valuation of ZS to other security companies which trade at significant revenue multiple discounts compared to ZS, I used other fast growing SaaS-based companies. My selected peer group includes Atlassian (TEAM), New Relic (NEWR), Salesforce (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW), Twilio (TWLO), Workday (WDAY), and Zendesk (ZEN). All of these names have revenue growth rates of 25%+ and trade at premium revenue multiples compared to the market.ZS EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThe average forward revenue multiple of the above peer group is 12.5x, well below ZS. To calculate ZS's revenue multiple, I assumed the high end of management's F18 revenue guidance range (implying a slightly aggressive stance) of $185 million. To be conservative, I assumed revenue would grow another 45% in F18, resulting in F19 estimated revenue of ~270 million (my higher revenue growth rate would imply higher F19 revenue, thus a lower revenue multiple).With a current price of ~$44, market cap of $5.2 billion and net cash balance of $287 million, ZS has an enterprise value of ~$4.9 billion. Using my ~$270 million F19 revenue estimate, it currently trades at 18.2x F19 revenue, still well above the peer group.With the peer group average of 12.5x, this essentially would imply ZS revenue of ~$390 million. To extrapolate this using my F19 estimated revenue, the company would have to grow another ~45% in F20 (reaching $390 million in revenue). Simply put, investors are already willing to pay for 12.5x F20 revenues today.Over the long-term, I believe ZS will maintain its leadership position in cloud-based security. The SaaS operating model along with differentiated product offering will lead to significant long-term success. However, at current valuation levels, I find it challenging to find much more upside. Heading into Q4 earnings and F19 guide, I see more downside risk than upside potential.Risks to ZS include competition from new players or legacy security providers. Their revenue multiple also poses a risk as these fast-growing names typically correct the most when the market begins to turn."

However, quality comes a steep price tag so you may have to put these stocks on a watch-list and wait on the valuation to come down a little or start out with a small position. Without further ado, our next candidate is Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS). Zscaler is a cloud-based cybersecurity company, IPO’d in March and made waves after it doubled in its first trading day.ZS data by YChartsZscaler is disrupting the firewall as we know it, billings accelerated last quarter, and it has visionary management, but the valuation is still high.I had been thinking of doing a piece on Zscaler for a while now but the legendary, Bert Hochfeld beat me to it last week. Still, I thought readers deserved a look at it.Zscaler, at its core, is a cybersecurity company, but it is difficult to wrap one’s head around the space in general. In the IT world, from an investor’s perspective, cybersecurity seems to be the most fragmented sub-sector. Players like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) offer comprehensive solutions whereas niche players like FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) offer specialty protection and then you have bigger companies like Symantec (SYMC) with Norton Anti-virus in its product portfolio. After a while, it becomes arduous to orient yourself in the cybersecurity landscape.Zscaler has set out to simplify cybersecurity. Traditionally, enterprises would implement the “castle-and-moat” method of setting up internet gateways with firewalls to establish a secure perimeter. Then, to cut costs, companies would employ a hub-and-spoke model.Instead of buying a ton of security appliances, companies would set up a few gateways and then route internet traffic through WANs (wide area networks) and VPNs (virtual private networks). However, this ends up increasing complexity and worsening user’s internet experience.Zscaler's solution is to route internet traffic through its security cloud, distributed across 100 data centers, so users can directly connect to any application regardless of location, network or device. Think of it this way: Picture the internet as a treasure chest. Your goal is to reach it. But along the way, there are bad-guys trying to stop you. Zscaler’s solution is to build you a bulletproof tunnel so you can simply walk right up to the treasure chest. In the old method, there were checkpoints where you had to stop and then fight off the bad-guys. This analogy is imperfect but hopefully it helps.The company offers two solutions; ZIA (Zscaler Internet Access) and ZPA (Zscaler Private Access). Both are similar to the tunnel analogy but ZPA is arguably more interesting as it connects users directly with an application, without the need for signing onto the network. Therefore, there is no trace for hackers to find. ZPA was created just a year ago and it accounts for about 5% of sales. But it is picking up steam, and in the last earnings call, management noted that ZPA recently received its first seven-figure deal.Speaking of the earnings call, management was pretty transparent, noting also that about 3/4th’s of Zscaler’s contracts are signed for three years or more. This reveals some sort of stickiness or valuable proof of concept. But one small quote really stuck out, the CFO stated,It seems like Zscaler has great business momentum, especially coming off of a strong IPO. The company is at the perfect intersection of the inevitable move to the cloud, mobile work-life and cybersecurity.As evidence that the market is coming to Zscaler, billings in the last quarter accelerated to 73% growth. Billings is just the change in deferred revenue added to sales. Revenue grew about 50% to $49 million but deferred revenue blossomed, leading to positive free cash flow margins, up 1300 bps from a year ago. Billings is a good indicator of demand because it is a more pure number than revenue since revenue recognition can get a little confusing for SaaS companies.In the wake of that impressive figure, gross margins didn’t subside in the meantime, but rather, increased from 79% to 81% year-over-year. Plus, the revenue expansion rate increased to 120% from 115% in 2017. This means the company is doing a good job of upselling to its transformation suite, which includes nearly every aspect of Zscaler’s internet access technology.The CEO and founder, Jay Chaudhry, has started four companies and sold each of them so he certainly knows what he is doing. He also owns about 25% of shares outstanding, worth about $1 billion today. His incentives are definitely aligned with investors.However, upon closer inspection, Ajay Mangal owns 28% of shares. If you read the footnotes, you realize that he is a trustee to the Chaudhry trust. So in essence, Mr. Chaudhry owns more than half of this company. Some investors may view this as a risk as it limits investor's voting power. However, I would rather have a CEO pour his life into a company rather than maintain my rights to vote on company issues. This line of thinking only holds for CEOs whom I trust though and Mr. Chaudhry's track record and the company's Glassdoor ratings provide enough evidence.On the earnings call, he was asked about bigger companies calling Zscaler out, Symantec even filing two patents lawsuits against them. Mr. Chaudhry response was awesome, saying,Earlier in the article, I spent a decent amount of time delving into the industry and Zscaler’s technology. This was intentional because, when you’re looking at a very richly valued name, understanding why it is so expensive can be difficult. Rarely does a company trade so expensively for no reason. The important thing as an investor is to understand the market the company is selling into and just how valuable the market could be.The company estimates that it is going after nearly $18 billion in addressable market, so Zscaler certainly has some room to run. But frankly, valuation still matters. Sure, you could hold a stock for 10 years and then reap the benefits but you also have to keep in mind opportunity cost.As stated earlier, revenue in the last quarter was $49 million. Guidance for the end of this fiscal year is around $185 million. The company’s market cap is $4.26 billion but proceeds from the IPO and other cash, bring the enterprise value down to about $3.9 billion. Therefore, the EV/sales ratio is 21x. In context, Shopify’s (NYSE:SHOP) forward EV/sales ratio comes out to about 17x so not a whole lot more expensive but Shopify is continually called out as one of the most overvalued names in tech.But valuation is not the only risk with ZScaler. The litigation from Symantec will most likely get resolved but there is always a possibility that the market gets spooked from it. Plus, the competition is fierce in cybersecurity so you have to keep an eye out. However, Zscaler seems to be dominating this niche versus incumbent technologies in the meantime.To be fully transparent, I bought a tiny starter position in my own portfolio after researching this one more in-depth. I’m not saying it is inexpensive. It’s not. But I certainly have more respect for the technology and its results in the real-world. You may think that I am contradicting myself by saying it is overvalued and buying a little bit. However, I see it differently. Valuation is tough and it is definitely not black-and-white but I have missed out too many times on so-called “expensive” stocks. Therefore, to remedy this, I buy a small position to learn more about it. Expensive usually is a sign of quality. It is our job to separate the wheat from the chaff though.Zscaler’s market, business momentum and visionary management have led to an expensive valuation. Either add this one to your watch-list or dip your toe in.Author’s Note: Hit the big, orange ""Follow"" button and toggle on the real-time updates box to get these articles before they hit the paywall.

4202273,104683,2018-08-27T12:15:42-04:00,"Zscaler is a very recent IPO, and the valuation could be deemed high by traditional metrics given its early stage.The company's billings accelerated from 49% last year to 73% this past quarter.Zscaler has a big TAM and can grow into its multiples.It is a leader in its category defining a new set of product offerings.","Zscaler (ZS) is a company in the leaders' quadrant with very few real competitors. It is rapidly growing in a market ripe for disruption. Zscaler enables the world's leading organizations to securely transform their networks and applications for a mobile and cloud-first world. I state what the company website highlight - ""Zscaler's flagship services the Zscaler Internet Access™ and Zscaler Private Access™, create fast and secure connections between users and applications, regardless of device, location, or network. Zscaler services are 100 percent cloud-delivered and offer the simplicity, enhanced security, and improved user experience that traditional appliances are unable to match"". Zscaler operates a multi-tenant distributed cloud security platform, protecting thousands of customers from cyber attacks and data loss in more than 185 countries.According to the company, Zscaler's award-winning web security solutions have been 100 percent cloud-based since the company's inception in 2008 and boasts the world's largest cloud-based security infrastructure built from the ground up, with innovations derived from more than 60 patents. Zscaler's security cloud processes over 35 billion transactions per day, for more than 5,000 organizations around the world. The Zscaler platform protects employees and data and users in 185 countries across 100 data centers with near-zero latency and no requirement of on-premises hardware or software.""Security has always been based on our control of devices and networks,"" says Michael Sutton, CISO at Zscaler. ""Zscaler has turned that upside down. We enable companies to secure users, no matter where they work, what network they use or what devices they're on.""Zscaler has been radically rethinking cloud security approaches for its clients and calls itself the World's largest pure-cloud security platform. It stands out in terms of design, performance, and scalability and provides a great ROI compared to traditional security approaches. It does not matter if an organization is small or big, they receive the same security with much lower investments. One of the main benefits ZS claims is protection ""all time from anywhere"" because the cloud is always up to date. In terms of management and visibility, there is a single panel where one can configure the policies for the entire organization worldwide, and ​after a proper implementation, the maintenance is very low.​ZS cloud platform eliminates the need for traditional on-prem security appliances that are difficult to maintain and require compromises between security, cost, and user experience. Zscaler platform offers two complementary services for enterprises who want to access applications on the public cloud without having to go through their data center:The ZIA product line has been their bread and butter for last few years, and in addition, ZPA, which was released last fiscal year, has been driving upsell activity for high-end transformation bundles, which includes the Cloud Firewall and Sandbox functionality.OpenDNS founder David Ulevitch runs Umbrella as a SVP for Cisco Security, and he called the current competition ""a race between"" Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Zscaler, and Symantec (SYMC). Ulevitch sees a multi-billion-dollar opportunity as more companies move to cloud-based security, explaining the difference between the newer and older approaches as the difference between closed-circuit cameras at a club and a bouncer at the door. Here is a comparison with Cisco and Blue Coat (NASDAQ:BLCT) (provided above) which was acquired by Symantec.The market for Secure Web Gateway (SWG) solutions is traditionally characterized by legacy on-premises appliances, but as businesses increasingly look to securely transform from the old world of IT to the new world of cloud and mobility, it becomes apparent that security needs to move to the cloud as well. According to Gartner, ""while SWG appliances still represent approximately 71% of the market share (as measured by revenue), the historical five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of cloud services is 32% (as compared to the five-year CAGR for appliances at 5%)"". Enterprises are implementing the cloud-based SWGs to provide security protection for remote offices that are connected directly to the internet.According to my analysis and validated by a few fellow contributors, the solutions from companies like Symantec, run via virtual appliances in a data center (DC) and as a result, every call has to go to the data center then back to the edge or access device. ZS has a wide moat letting SDNs to run on the internet without any redirects or VPNs and makes it unique in the market TODAY. This is possible because they have set up their server software across 100s of locations around the globe. It could be monopoly for a few years like ANET was in the last few years or NEWR looks like today. ANET has eaten Cisco's lunch in the last 5 years and no other company has been able to catch up with it because of its EOS software, and we can see their growth of 25%+ with 30% operating margins continues unhindered. NEWR is doing the same with their APM suite of products and their only competitor AppDynamics was taken over by Cisco last year. ZS is likely to have an unfettered path to success for a few years ahead.According to a pre-IPO report, Cisco offered a hefty price for a takeover and Symantec has a lawsuit against them. This leads me to believe that ZS has a highly disruptive take on the traditional perimeter defense security model and represents the future of cloud-based security that can easily deliver 30%+ growth for next 5-10 years.Revenues in the latest 3Q 2018 (the first one since going public) grew to $49.2 million, keeping pace with Zscaler's 49% y/y growth rate in prior quarters when the company was still private and surpassed estimates by a nine-point difference.Zscaler has a typical contract of 1-3 years; hence, new deals in any given quarter are typically not fully recognized as revenues upfront. Billings, which measure the quarter's revenues plus change in deferred revenues, are a better metric to assess longer-term revenue growth and the billings results were superb. Zscaler exceeded expectations with 73% y/y billings, surpassing revenues from both a growth rate and absolute dollar standpoint. This indicates that the company has added more revenues to the longer-term pipeline than it has recognized in the quarter, a strong signal for continued revenue growth. ZS will thus have a lot of deferred revenue with many of its multi-year contracts paid up front, and this gives them a great cushion to invest for the future and protect their moat.Remo Canessa, Zscaler's CFO, commented that the company enjoyed a strong mix of longer-term deals that were billed upfront. Canessa notes that Zscaler's billings would still have grown by 60% y/y, even when extracting for the contribution, of these longer-term billings.Gross margin in the quarter was 80.8% on a GAAP basis, up 200bps from 78.8% in 3Q of 2017. I believe it is too early for me to speak on cost efficiencies, and I would like to keep an eye on how it moves. I will delve into it after a couple more quarters once we see a pattern emerge.3Q operating expenses grew 9% sequentially and 38% year-over-year to $42.8 million, of which sales and marketing increased 9% sequentially and 43% year-over-year to $28.4 million. R&D increased 3% sequentially and 20% year-over-year to $8.9 million, as the company continues to invest to enhance product functionality and to offer new products.Consensus estimate is $246 million for 2018, and I assume they should achieve close to $300 million given the 60% billings growth. They have an amazing ARR of 120%, and I believe their new ZPA product line will increase that number substantially in the next few years.A lot of pros on Seeking Alpha have been speaking about ZS being overvalued, and I would agree with them, but only partially. As I wrote in one of my earlier blogs on how to value and invest in cloud-based businesses, the basic premise is once a company has spent the costs on infrastructure and building the product or services and the sales cost to acquire a customer, it's just a matter of expanding the client numbers to start seeing the effect of scale. And if it comes with little to no debt and high inside ownership, I would jump on that bandwagon without anchoring to a price, which will eventually fetch great returns.The IPO prospectus reads that an amount of $17.7 billion is annually spent on security applications, and as per Zsacler, this amount can be directly served by Zscaler's disruptive products. When a company has such a big TAM, I believe it will grow into its valuation, and companies like ISRG and NFLX have made that abundantly clear in the last decade.The big risk with any new technology is time needed to get it accepted and get to an inflection point, and if some new entrant comes during this gestation period, the sales multiples may come down. According to an eminent investment analyst and former Managing Director at World Quant LLC Ishpreet Pandher, this cloud-based architecture could be a business risk for ZS since switching costs would be lower for a company to move from Zscaler to another newer innovation as there is no embedded devices and stickiness in his model. Though that could happen, I believe that since ZS has so many locations with their servers up and running, it will take time for the new player to get to this breadth of the service infrastructure needed.One can definitely expect to see some volatility with the impending lock-in period expiring in Oct. 2018, and the regular ups and downs with high growth mid-cap stocks, post earnings releases.I would probably wait until the lock-in period expires before I get a truckload of this company stock just in case we get a head fake. In the meanwhile, I would also be accumulating it in small quantities when the market gives an opportunity to pick it up on a lower sales multiple of 10-12X.Disclaimer - The author does not own the stock, ZS, mentioned in this article and may initiate a buy after the 3-day period.I wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
4180548,25120,2018-06-10T05:39:50-04:00,"Zscaler has just delivered on strong third-quarter results, and continues to guide for further growth.I found the company appealing at the IPO price and valuation, yet expectations have increased a great deal.As the valuation has quadrupled compared to just a few months ago, I find it very easy to pass on Zscaler now, and am surprised by the run higher.","Zscaler (ZS) has been an IPO which has taken off in a big way. I looked at the prospects for this cloud security player in March when the company went public. At the time, I found the 50% year-on-year growth numbers reported by the business appealing, while losses were coming down on a relative basis.While I was very attracted to the valuation of the business at the offer price, the 80% run on the opening day has diminished that appeal, at least in my eyes, at the time. It appears that I have been too cautious again, as Zscaler has only continued its momentum following the release of the third-quarter results.Zscaler offers security and accessibility of and to corporate networks, as users connect to these networks from many different locations, through many different devices. Having spotted the emergence of this trend very early, Zscaler was founded in 2007 to bring real solutions in securing these diversified systems.The solution is a changed design and approach to network security, which is offered through the company's cloud platform, spread across more than a hundred data centers, located all over the world.By the end of 2017, the company has signed up some 2,800 customers, as the impressive growth of the business is driven by higher revenues per user/corporation and not necessarily increase in the customer count. That is a very reassuring sign, as it shows that clients are very happy with the services of the business. Another positive sign was and is the fact that CEO and founder Jay Chaudhry holds a big stake in the business, as he has been a successful entrepreneur before.Back in March, Zscaler originally aimed to sell 10 million shares at just $10-$12 per share. Pricing was raised ahead of the IPO, as shares were finally sold at $16 per share, only to double to levels in the low thirties in the first day/days of trading.With 117 million shares outstanding, the company was originally valued at $1.3 billion in the pre-IPO process (at a midpoint price of $11 per share), although the valuation has risen to $3.7 billion at $32 per share. If we include the post-IPO net cash position of $250 million, the jump in the valuation of the operating assets is even more pronounced.I found the business appealing at the time, because revenue growth was only accelerating, as revenues for the year of 2017 were up by 57% to $125.7 million. The company reported an operating loss (GAAP) of $35 million that year, which marks an increase in absolute levels, but relative losses were down 5% to 28% of sales.The company has a broken book year, as revenues for the first six months of this fiscal year were up by 51% to $84.8 million, combined with operating losses of $17.7 million. With revenues trending at a rate of $170 million a year, I noted that the 10 times sales multiple at the IPO price was high, but probably justifiable given the >50% growth rates and continued narrowing of operating losses.Unfortunately, shares did not trade long at this 10 times sales multiple (corresponding to the IPO price of $16), as shares essentially doubled on their opening day. Part of these gains dissipated a bit, as shares fell to $25 in May, in part because the COO left. In hindsight, this was the dip which should have been bought as shares have risen back to $40 by now on the back of some very strong results.Third-quarter momentum remained very strong, with revenues being up by 49% to $49.2 million, indicating that the annual run rate is already coming in at $200 million. While the growth rate came in just below the 50% mark, actual billings are up 73% to $54.7 million, adding to a growing deferred revenue balance which actually comes in at $125 million.Operating losses are close to stabilizing (on a GAAP basis), as they fell by 5 percentage points to 18% of sales in the third quarter. While momentum appears very strong, the guidance perhaps looks a bit soft at first sight, with fourth-quarter revenues seen at $50-$51 million, and non-GAAP losses seen at $6-$7 million, up from the $2.6 million adjusted loss posted in the third quarter. While sequential growth looks very modest, this might really be reflective of both a very strong third quarter and cautious guidance as well.After shares have essentially exploded to $40 in response to the numbers, the market value of the firm has jumped to $4.8 billion with some 120 million shares outstanding. After backing out cash holdings of $287 million, operating assets are valued at close to $4.5 billion.In comparison, ahead of the IPO, operating assets were valued at close to just a billion based on the pre-IPO valuation at $11 per share. Consequently, valuations have ballooned, with shares now trading at a sales multiple in excess of 20 times.Truth of the matter is that the operating performance of Zscaler is outright impressive. Looking back in time, there are always a few hot tech IPOs which have increased a factor of 10, 20 or even 100 times over a long period of time, but often many more which have saddled investors with big losses. As shares have essentially quadrupled in just a three-month period, and the valuation is already on the verge of breaking the $5 billion mark, I do find it very easy to not chase the momentum as shares are by no means cheap.At the time of the IPO, I could justify the 10 times sales multiple given the growth and fact that losses were coming down, as the valuation compared to peers was fairly similar. The problem is that even if I use the current annualised billings number of $220 million, I still end up with a 20 times multiple for operating assets, in comparison to 7.5 times at the IPO price of $16.Hence, I am not scaling into Zscaler, although I will keep the shares on my watchlist, as I look for continued growth and serious dips when the valuation comes in closer to 10 times sales, before dipping in."
4180597,103480,2018-06-10T13:17:04-04:00,"Zscaler, the ""security-as-a-service"" company that went public earlier this year, has easily been one of the best IPO performers to date.The company recently reported its first-earnings quarter since going public, topping analyst expectations on revenue, EPS, and guidance.Shares vaulted up nearly double digits, taking shares up to 2.5x their IPO price of $16.Despite its diminutive revenue scale and the fact that the company has yet to turn a profit, Zscaler is valued at nearly $5 billion.The company is trading at approximately 18x next year's revenues, one of the most absurdly rich valuations in the software sector.","Ever since Zscaler's (ZS) IPO earlier in March, the company has earned a wild reputation as an ultra-hot stock among both investors and Wall Street. Zscaler's first-day ""pop"" of 106% on its IPO date, which took shares from an opening price of $16 to $33 by the close, is one of the best one-day performances ever recorded for a recent IPO. By that point, most observers were betting that Zscaler had gotten ahead of itself and would soon correct - but uncannily enough, Zscaler has continued its rampant rally.The most recent catalyst, Zscaler's Q3 earnings report and its first earnings release since going public, has taken Zscaler up another 7% to above $40:ZS data by YChartsWhile there is no doubt that the first earnings report is a major milestone for any newly public company that can set the tone with both Wall Street and the investing public, neither a good Q1 nor Zscaler's overall narrative and business model can justify its absurdly rich valuation. Even when using the most bullish of growth forecasts for the following year, Zscaler looks incredibly overvalued.At its current post-earnings share price of $40.53, and using its most recent share count of 119.6 million as recorded in Zscaler's latest 10-Q filing, the company has a current market cap of $4.85 billion. For some context, that gives it a larger market cap than longtime SaaS stalwart Box (BOX), which has a market cap of just $3.73 billion despite being three times Zscaler's revenues. I'd argue as well that Box's progress in applied AI (as showcased in its Box Skills feature set, and highlighted at the Sohn Investment Conference by the founder of Social Capital) gives its intellectual property a much higher value than Zscaler's.If we net out Zscaler's $287 million of balance sheet cash (which includes its IPO proceeds), we arrive at an enterprise value of $4.56 billion for the company. Zscaler has also guided to revenues of $184-185 million (+47% y/y) for the rest of the fiscal FY18, which only has one quarter remaining. If we extrapolate its revenue growth forward and estimate 40% growth for FY19, we arrive at an estimated FY19 revenue base of $258.3 million. This puts the current valuation at 17.7x EV/FY19 revenues - hands down one of the richest valuation multiples in the SaaS sector. That's not to mention the fact that valuation multiples also vary widely in the cybersecurity space. Though Zscaler has the benefit of being primarily a recurring revenue subscription vendor, as well as a premium growth rate over most of its cybersecurity comps, there still is little justification to the fact that Zscaler trades at a valuation that's more than double its nearest comps:OKTA EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsIn my view, Zscaler has very little room to move upward from here. At this point, investing in Zscaler is like investing in a cryptocurrency - you're depending on hype and trading momentum to carry the day, not fundamentals. There's no denying that Zscaler is a strong, recurring revenue SaaS company with a defensible niche, but its valuation no longer has rhyme nor reason.Consider also the fact that its lockup expiration is drawing nearer, with the expiration date landing on September 16 according to NASDAQ. This means that the insiders who own the majority of the company's shares and have thus far been prohibited from trading Zscaler's stock will finally have the opportunity to unload their shares and cash in on more than 2x in paper gains. Investors would be foolish to think that this event won't cause any downward pressure on shares in the weeks surrounding the lockup expiration date. Stay far away from Zscaler until the stock stabilizes - when a stock rally like this one has no basis in fundamentals, it tends not to be long-lived.Here's a look at Zscaler's Q3 results:Figure 1. Zscaler Q3 earnings resultsSource: Zscaler 10-Q filingRevenues grew 49% y/y to $49.2 million, keeping up with Zscaler's robust revenue growth rate in prior unpublished quarters when the company was still private, and surpassing analyst estimates of $46.0 million (+40% y/y) by a wide nine-point spread.The billings results were even better. Because Zscaler has a typical contract length of 1-3 years, the new deals that the company signs in any given quarter are typically not fully recognized as revenues upfront. Billings, which measures the quarter's revenues plus the change in deferred revenues, is the better metric to assess longer-term revenue pipeline success. And in this regard, Zscaler greatly exceeded expectations with 73% y/y billings growth to $54.7 million, far surpassing revenues from both a growth rate and absolute dollar volume standpoint. This indicates that the company has added more revenues to the longer-term pipeline than it has recognized in the quarter, a strong signal for continued revenue growth.Remo Canessa, Zscaler's CFO, commented that the company enjoyed a strong mix of strong longer-term deals that were billed upfront. Even when extracting for the contribution of these longer-term billings, however, Canessa notes that Zscaler's billings would still have grown by 60% y/y.The company also made noticeable improvements in its already-strong gross margins. Gross margin in the quarter was 80.8% on a GAAP basis, up 200bps from 78.8% in 3Q17. Elsewhere on the cost front, Zscaler also managed to find efficiencies. Sales and marketing spending, in particular, which is Zscaler's largest expense category, shaved off 2% as a percentage of revenues to 61% versus 63% in the year-ago quarter.As a result of the gross margin improvements and opex efficiencies, GAAP operating losses in the quarter held roughly flat at -$9.0 million, but represented a slimmer -18.3% operating margin versus -22.9% in 1Q17. The company's pro forma EPS of -$0.02 also smashed estimates of -$0.08.It's not surprising that investors took well to Zscaler's Q3 results, sending shares up nearly double digits and extending a long rally dating back to Zscaler's IPO in March. If we discard Zscaler's valuation context for a moment, we can say that it definitely deserved a post-earnings rally, given its huge billings performance and strong gross margin improvements.Unfortunately, Zscaler's valuation is the largest elephant in the room when it comes to evaluating its investment potential. We can't simply forget that virtually no other SaaS or high-growth technology company trades at ~18x forward revenues, no matter how strong the name. Investors who buy at the top of the market now are likely to get burned - history has shown that very few companies can keep trading at elevated multiples for extended periods of time."
4180889,20521,2018-06-11T20:07:14-04:00,Zscaler reportedly spurned a $2 billion buyout bid from Cisco before its IPO.But the cyber security space is highly competitive and innovative as well.How will Zscaler navigate in its new public avatar? How will it take advantage of the unprecedented opportunity in SaaS?,"In March, Billion-Dollar Unicorn and enterprise cloud security firm Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) listed successfully on Nasdaq. Last week, its first earnings report as a public company blew past all analysts' projections, and the stock jumped by 38%, making it the best-performing U.S. tech IPO of the year.Zscaler's third quarter revenue grew 49% to $49.2 million driven by a 73% jump in calculated billings. GAAP net loss was $8.8 million or $0.14 per share, compared to $7.6 million or $0.34 per share a year ago. Pro forma non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.02, compared to $0.05 a year ago. Analysts expected a loss of $0.08 per share on revenue of $46 million.Cash and cash equivalents were $287.4 million as of April 30, 2018.For the fourth quarter, the company expects revenue of $50 to $51 million, non-GAAP loss of $6 to $7 million, and pro forma non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.05 to $0.06 using shares outstanding of about 120 million. Analysts forecast sales of $48.4 million on an adjusted loss of $0.09 per share.For fiscal year 2018, Zscaler expects revenue of $184 to $185 million, non-GAAP loss of $19 to $20 million, and pro forma non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.17 to $0.18.As per its S-1 filing, revenue in 2017 increased 57% to $125.7 million in 2017 with a net loss of $35.5 million. Its revenue increased 50% to $80.3 million in 2016 from $53.7 million in 2015. Net loss was $27.4 million in 2016 and $12.8 million in 2015.San Jose-based Zscaler was founded by serial entrepreneur Jay Chaudhury in 2008. After successfully flipping one of his many startups, Jay realized that his next challenge would be to create something that would have a lasting impact in the market. It was then that he came up with the idea of Zscaler. Jay wanted to offer Web security in the cloud that would be able to cater to the rapidly growing mobile world by integrating point products. You can read my interview with him on his entrepreneurial journey.Zscaler today has a highly scalable, multi-tenant, globally distributed cloud capable of providing inline inspection that offers a full range of enterprise network security services. It has designed a purpose-built three-tier architecture starting with its core operating system and adding layers of security and networking innovations over time. Its cloud platform is protected by more than 100 issued and pending patents.The company generates revenue primarily from sales of subscriptions to access its cloud platform, together with related support services. Its subscription pricing is calculated on a per-user basis. Subscription and support revenue is calculated ratably over the life of the contract, which is generally one to three years. It has more than 2,800 customers across the world in every major industry including government agencies and more than 200 of the Forbes Global 2000.Its competitors include independent IT security vendors such as Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Symantec Corporation (SYMC), which offer a broad mix of network and endpoint security products; large networking vendors, such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), which offer security appliances and incorporate security capabilities in their networking products; and companies such as FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), Forcepoint (previously Websense), F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV), and Pulse Secure with point solutions that compete with some of the features of Zscaler cloud platform, such as proxy, firewall, sandboxing and advanced threat protection, data loss prevention, encryption, load balancing, and VPN.Zscaler went public on March 16 with a list price of $16 per share. By the first day of trading, it shot up by 106% to $33. It raised $192 million in the IPO.Two months later, its COO and Head of Sales Bill Welch announced that he will be quitting to take on a more senior role at another tech company. The stock fell about 9% following the news. But the dip has been more than overcome by the recent surge.The stock is trading at $37.79 with a market cap of $4.5 billion. Its 52-week low is $34.85 and 52-week high is $42.16. Analysts have increased their outlook on the company and the average price target rose to $32 from $29 a week ago, per Bloomberg.Zscaler reportedly spurned a $2 billion buyout bid from Cisco before its IPO. But the cyber security space is highly competitive and innovative as well. How will Zscaler navigate in its new public avatar? How will it take advantage of the unprecedented opportunity in SaaS?"
4180507,21815,2018-06-09T09:21:39-04:00,"It seems to be a terrific solution commanding an equally terrific valuation.However, there is a lot to be said for the shares as there is already operational leverage and positive free cash flow despite management prioritizing growth.Still, we would wait until the dust settles a bit as the shares have gone parabolic.","Zscaler (ZS) is a company freshly off its IPO (a raving success by all means), offering a unique solution to company security problems in the age of the cloud and dispersed access.The company apparently does this so well that they really have little or no competition, at least not for their integral approach (the so-called 'transformation bundle', its most comprehensive solution), and this resulted in runaway revenue growth of 49% in Q3 and a net retention rate of 120% in Q3.There are secular trends in the company's favor and there is also a good deal of leverage in its business model. The company has just published its first quarter with positive free cash flow, and it enjoys rising prices.In short, this is a company that is firing from most, if not all, cylinders, but are the shares a good buy here? Well, valuation metrics tend to give less firm answers for these kinds of companies which are still in the first innings of their development, so this is basically up to individual investors to decide.Our view is that while present valuation is absurd (the shares go at 27x sales), the company is likely to grow into its valuation, and at some stage in the future, management has the opportunity to let the leverage kick in.It certainly looks like investors are aware of that, which is why the shares have gone wild twice. First, directly after the IPO (priced at just $16 a share), and more recently after good Q3 figures:This is after the shares had already doubled on their listing debut in March this year. We suspect that the strong price performance also has something to do with the scarcity of the shares, with just 13.8M issued including the green shoe at its March IPO.We're not sure where the 54.6M shares in the float on FinViz come from, Yahoo has a float of 12.6M.Here is a brief description of what their offerings are about (Q3CC):For those wanting more detail, the company has a handy ebook (Pdf) from which the following graphic explanations originates:The company offers three packages of cloud security solutions and two complementary services:ZPA is still a tiny fraction of sales (about 5%), but it's rapidly growing. The three packages are:Investors will appreciate the ample opportunities for up-sell from business to transformation, and the fact that this comes with a doubling of the price. It's the number one reason explaining the net dollar retention rate of 120%, and it also increases stickiness (Q3CC):Although additional sells of ZPA also start to contribute to the net dollar retention rate, demand for ZPA comes from two motives:In the latter, it does have competition of course. Not only from traditional VPN providers but also from newer solutions like Akemai and Cloudplayer and some newer ones. According to management:Be that as it may, its transformational package has no real substitute, and demand for ZPA is rising rapidly, so at this stage there don't seem to be too many worries about competition.Apart from the 49% revenue growth in Q3, calculated billing (the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus total revenue recognized in that quarter) growth was even considerably better at 73% (with the street expecting just 42% growth), benefiting from a surge in up-front billings of multi-year subscriptions.While management is prioritizing top-line growth, and rightly so, given the fact that the field still seems to be wide open to their solutions, margins are actually already expanding.That is very encouraging for investors, we have to say the company enjoys a really high 81% gross margin (up from 79% in Q3 2017), and here is why (Q3CC):But it's operating margin that already shows substantial leverage, improving by an impressive 9 percentage points to negative 6%. Despite still negative operating margin, the company produced positive free cash flow of $3.7M, although this is almost entirely the result of stock-based compensation ($3.3M).We see little reason why growth will not continue, management cited three tailwinds (Q3CC):The company also has quite a few levers:On the partner ecosystem, this does exist but its importance is difficult to assess:And then of course are the usual forces to get shareholders excited by providing more bang for every revenue buck:The company increased its guidance slightly after the blow-out Q3 figures:FY 2018:They also have ambitions for 2020 (Q3CC):One could read too much into this, but it could mean that the Q3 positive free cash flow might not be reproduced the coming quarters, as their ambition is for sustained positive free cash flows only by 2020.The main risks for shareholders are, in our view:Valuation concerns are obvious at 27x sales, even if this is a backward looking metric. Revenue is guided at $184M-$185M, and with a market cap of $4.2B and $287M in cash, that's still 21x 2018 sales.But since their fiscal year ends in July, we're already almost in fiscal 2019 so adding another 50% to revenue (ballpark) would take the EV/S multiple to 14.That's still steep by any means, but taking on board the rapidly rising revenue, the margin expansion and the cash flow which look like turning positive (they were in Q3, but it remains to be seen whether this is structural), it is already down from the stratosphere.The main risk seems competition. While management argues that their transformation package especially has no real equivalent in the market place, this stuff can change.We're looking at companies that have a worldwide network of servers like Zscaler has, companies like Akamai (AKAM) which already offer a host of cloud security solutions. Existing internet security players like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) will also have taken note of this new kid on the block.We're economists, so don't expect a wholesale internet market security analysis here, there are people much more qualified to embark on that. However, given the enormous demand for the company's services from people who do know and have a stake in the evaluation of competing offers, competition doesn't seem to be a prime worry at this juncture.The shares are going parabolic. As we wrap up this article, they've just closed above $40 on Friday. Undoubtedly the IPO of the year, given the fact that they went to the market at $16 less than three months ago.The enthusiasm of shareholders isn't surprising and it seems to mirror the enthusiasm of the company's customers, and then some. At 14x next year's sales while still loss making, an awful lot is already priced in.It's difficult to see what kind of barriers to entry competitors face if they want to replicate the company's security solution."
4157868,104326,2018-03-20T15:16:43-04:00,"Tech security company Zscaler had a terrific IPO which saw its share value quickly more than double in value.Zscaler is in a valuable and growing market, and reports good revenue which has grown at a consistently high rate.However, the company faces intense competition and is likely overvalued at its current share price.Zscaler could eventually be a solid value buy once the IPO hype wears off, but investors should wait for prices to drop significantly before investing.","After months of deprivation, the first tech IPO of the year raced out to a roaring success. As MarketWatch reported, “Zscaler shares surged 106% to close at $33 on volume of 16.8 million shares Friday.” Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) now has a market cap of nearly $4 billion, and this success undoubtedly has Spotify (NADAQ:SPOT) and Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) sitting in the wings, salivating and wondering whether they can do as well when they go public.While such success should be applauded, investors now need to ponder whether this company will remain a good investment at this higher price point. Zscaler has attracted this much buzz for a reason. Its specialization in cloud security will continue to grow more valuable as more businesses using online calculators look to protect themselves after multiple well-publicized hacks, and its reported financial numbers are acceptable.These factors were enough to make Zscaler a buy at its IPO price of $27.50, but $33 is a different matter. Zscaler does face certain challenges in its valuation and power to deal with competition, and is partially buoyed by IPO hype which will fade eventually. As a result, now is not a good time to go for this stock.As more businesses use the cloud, more information is placed on the cloud which is at risk. Businesses in the past have assumed that cloud security could be left to the cloud provider, but recent cloud hacking incidents affecting major companies have shown that businesses must protect themselves in a way which acknowledges the differences between network and cloud security.This is where Zscaler steps in. Instead of attempting to shut out company networks from outside forces, it provides a firewall and monitors data to remove anything unwanted. Zscaler states in its SEC report that it has more than 2,800 customers and daily blocks 100 million threats and performs more than 120,000 unique security updates.By offering a solid product, Zscaler has seen its revenue climb from $53 million in the 12 months ending July 31, 2015, to $80 million and $125 million in the subsequent two years. These numbers are obviously good, especially as Zscaler can show that the rate of revenue growth has remained at about 50 percent for the past two years.The downside in the numbers is that Zscaler’s net losses have increased from $12 million in 2015 to $35 million in 2017, and Zscaler has the standard line of how they “may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.” However, I would argue that this is not a serious concern. Zscaler reports positive gross profits, has no debt, and thus can continue to focus on expanding its business in a lucrative field. These are likely some of the major factors why it stormed off to such an impressive start.But that same impressive start is why investors should stay away from Zscaler for now as it faces certain serious issues. Because cloud security is such a critical field, Zscaler faces tough competition from larger companies like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC). In fact, Symantec launched a lawsuit in 2016 alleging several patent violations. No ruling has been made yet, and Zscaler notes in its SEC report that the litigation is in “early stages” and that they are vigorously defending themselves. Nevertheless, the lawsuit is one tripping point which could derail Zscaler’s plans.But the simplest reason why investors should be concerned is that Zscaler is overvalued. MarketWatch states that at $33 a share, Zscaler has a market cap of $3.87 billion. A price-to-sales ratio using revenue over the 12 months ending July 31, 2017, comes out to 31. If we decide to estimate revenue over the next 12 months while assuming that Zscaler can keep its 50 percent revenue growth rate (this is being generous), the ratio goes down to about 21. By comparison, Symantec and Cisco both have a five-year price-to-sales ratio of less than 5.Price to sales ratio has flaws, but it is just one example of how Zscaler at its current rate is heavily overvalued despite its upsides and should be expected to go down.While there's a lot to like about Zscaler, its impressive debut was likely due as much to investors wanting to jump on the first tech unicorn as it was due to Zscaler’s own merits. Once other tech IPOs debut and the inevitable hype fades away, investors will likely back off and we could see Zscaler’s value fall. If you were lucky enough to take advantage of the recent boost, I would strongly recommend selling now.But this does not mean that investors should disregard Zscaler entirely. The company has long-term potential due to the importance of its specialization and has good financial numbers. It is merely overvalued at the present time. If the company loses value and falls below $20, then Zscaler could be a good buy. And there's no doubt that Zscaler’s success will persuade other tech companies to go public, and investors should keep an eye on that. Just do not purchase Zscaler now."
4157297,103480,2018-03-17T06:02:23-04:00,"Zscaler launched a very successful IPO, with shares up 106% on their first day of trading.The IPO priced at $16, above an initial range of $13-15. Shares opened for public trading at $27.50, however, leaving ordinary investors little chance to swoop in for gains.The offering raised $192 million and now values Zscaler's market cap at just under $4 billion.Shares look extremely rich, valuing Zscaler at about 20x forward revenues.","Well, Zscaler's (NASDAQ:ZS) IPO has just proven that the IPO markets are alive and well in 2018. Zscaler, a ""security-as-a-service"" company that provides secure connections and firewalls for enterprises using third-party cloud applications, is the first major technology company and the first ""unicorn"" to go public this year. Its March 16 offering came a week before the highly anticipated IPO of Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), which recently released its intended valuation of $7-7.9 billion in its offering.Nevertheless, the success of Zscaler's IPO shows that there's plenty of love to go around. Zscaler turned out to be one of those IPOs where the pricing range kept going up and up. In its initial filings, Zscaler had called for an initial pricing range of $10-12, which would have valued the company at slightly over $1 billion - hardly enough for it to keep its ""unicorn"" status. A week later, Zscaler upped its range to $13-15. The company finally settled on $16 for the deal, which at 12 million shares sold implies a $192 million IPO.Still, though, Zscaler seems to have left some money on the table. Demand for the offering was evidently so strong that shares opened on the NASDAQ at $27.50 (so in theory, the company could have raised at least $100 million more), already more than double the company's first pass at valuation. And despite the elevated opening price, buying activity throughout the day was frantic, with shares closing at $33 - more than double the IPO price of $16 and 20% above the opening price.ZS Price data by YChartsI wrote in a prior article that I believe Zscaler to be a fantastic company on both qualitative and quantitative fronts. The widespread migration toward cloud applications certainly does warrant specialized security measures to safeguard against increasingly common data breaches. Zscaler also has a massive base of 2,800 enterprise customers, robust >50% growth alongside a huge gross margin, and relative slim margins that clearly point toward a path to profitability.However, I'm not an enthusiastic buyer of Zscaler shares at $33. The company doesn't have exclusive domain over its space. While it may have technological advantages in being cloud-focused, it's up against some heavyweights of its own, including Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW). Palo Alto Networks and plenty of other cybersecurity companies also trade at much cheaper valuation multiples, leaving Zscaler's stock at risk of being compared to much more modest comps.To some extent I believe Zscaler's run-up was due to the lack of deals in the technology space as of late. IPOs have been largely dry since November, and investors still bear plenty of love for high-growth tech stocks and have plenty of capital to invest. This is a hugely positive indicator for Dropbox next week, which may be able to bring up its ""down round"" valuation of $7-7.9 billion up in response to such a strong showing from Zscaler.But as for Zscaler itself - don't let hype cloud a rational analysis of the company's valuation. The stock probably won't take long to come back down to earth.Here's how the chips fell in the Zscaler IPO:Here's a look as well at the company's post-IPO cap table:Source: S-1A filingNote especially that Jay Chaudhry, the company's 59-year-old founder and CEO, owns about 23% of outstanding shares - a higher percentage than is typical for most tech IPOs. Compounded with the fact that Chaudhry takes only a nominal cash salary ($23,660, according to the filing), we can at least say that his interests will be aligned with his shareholders'.The valuation story for Zscaler, however, isn't too compelling for a long investor. As noted above, when using Zscaler's fully-diluted share count of 135.2 million shares, the company carries a huge $4.47 billion market cap (the undiluted market cap, for reference, is $3.87 billion).We note that Zscaler has $71.6 million of cash on its balance sheet as well as an estimated $178.6 million in gross proceeds from the offering. Netting out this $321.8 million of cash from Zscaler's market cap, we arrive at a fully diluted enterprise value of $4.15 billion.I noted in a prior article that Zscaler has $154.3 million in trailing twelve months revenue. Based on the company's most recent quarterly growth rate of 53% y/y, we can bake in some deceleration and estimate ~40% growth in the coming year - implying a forward twelve months revenue forecast of $214.5 million.This means that Zscaler, at its $33 closing price, trades at an EV/FTM revenue multiple of 19.3x, rivaling just about any other public tech company trading in the markets right now.Even Snap (SNAP), whose ridiculously hyped IPO once had it trading above 20x forward revenues, has since come down to 14x forward revenues, as shown in the chart below. An even better comp is Palo Alto Networks, a firewall security company that more or less competes directly against Zscaler, is still showing robust double-digit growth, and produces huge free cash flow margins (like Dropbox - which, by the way, is currently pricing its IPO at under 5x forward revenues).SNAP EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsBased on existing comps, it doesn't seem likely that Zscaler's massive valuation can hold for very long - let alone see another spike.Starting next week, all eyes will turn toward the Dropbox IPO, potentially deflating some of the air in Zscaler's balloon. While I do maintain the fact that Zscaler is a terrific business with huge potential, its valuation essentially exceeds that of almost every other technology company in the market. Its financial profile - 50% growth, negative margins and cash flow but approaching breakeven - is strong, but certainly nothing that merits a 20x multiple.As long as Zscaler is trading in the $30s (or even the high $20s), I'm on the sidelines. I'd look to 10x forward revenues as a fair multiple for Zscaler's stock, implying a price target of $18. The fact that the company itself priced the IPO at just $16 even after having a chance to price higher indicates that even Zscaler might be surprised at the valuation that Mr. Market gave it."
4184749,98236,2018-06-29T12:59:00-04:00,"Zscaler is a relatively new IPO in the cyber-security space.Its valuation looks extreme - until one considers the disruptive nature of its technology.The company has developed a proprietary paradigm, protected by 100 patents and applications, that can replace the traditional network security architecture of firewalls and VPNs.The company is seeing rapid adoption of its technology with bookings growth of 73% last quarter, a rather substantial growth acceleration.The company is seeing significant adoption of what it calls ""transformation bundles"" that do away with the use of firewall technology.","It has become quite the fashion to call the shares of some companies absurdly valued. Everyone seems to have a favorite in that regard. I tend to avoid those kinds of loaded characterizations because the issues involved are usually far more complex. Some weeks ago I wrote that the purchase by Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) of Mulesoft at what appeared to be an elevated valuation could readily be justified using standard financial metrics. Yes, looking at consensus numbers, the shares of Zscaler appear very expensive. But I think readers and investors have to consider the nature of the opportunity. Simply put, what Zscaler has developed has the potential to obsolete 25 years or so of investment in both firewalls and VPNs and that is a huge opportunity that is simply not yet reflected in consensus valuation computations.As I write this article, the world of IT stocks is in one of its corrective phases, although the correction seems to be waning. Zscaler shares have resisted the gravitational pull to a greater or lesser extent, and the balance of this article is focused on showing what investors are finding special in this company. I don’t want to get involved in this article in making some over-arching macro call about the state of the market. I think it is evident that the torrid pace of share price appreciation seen in much of this year amongst hyper-growth IT vendors is unsustainable. On the other hand, their growth prospects are still under assessed, and their potential profits, as the value of a SaaS model becomes increasingly apparent, is not yet quite recognized by many readers and investors. So, yes, Zscaler shares, along with the shares of many other high-growth tech companies, seem ""expensive."" And they almost certainly will not achieve the percentage share price appreciation in 2H as has been the case in the year to date. But when I see the potential inherent in this business, I think that investors can rationally think of establishing a starter position with the thought of... well scaling into a full holding over time.This is not an article that seeks to find gold amongst dross. While Zscaler is not on the lips of every investor, it is quite well known in the IT world, both as a company bringing a set of disruptive technologies to market, but then too, as a “shooting star” stock. The company’s shares went public a bit more than three months ago, and the shares doubled that day. Since then shares have been as much as 20% higher after a strong quarterly earnings release, and have since retreated about 10%-plus since valuations of tech names have come under some pressure. The company grew its top line by 49% by last quarter with some level of cost leverage, both year on year, and sequentially. The published First Call consensus, presumably not to be taken too seriously by any professional investor, suggests that percentage revenue growth will decline to 43% this fiscal year compared to the 54% growth in the first nine months of the fiscal year, and to 32% in fiscal year 2020. No one buying or owning the shares thinks that the company will not exceed those kind of results materially, and neither does this writer. In fact, the rather noticeable acceleration in billings growth, which reached 73% last quarter (including both short and long term deferred revenues) might suggest a similar future acceleration in percentage revenue growth.As this is written, tech shares have been in the midst of a corrective phase. Again, it is not my purpose to opine on things like trade wars or investment restrictions. This is an article on Zscaler. At this point, much of that correction seems to have bypassed the shares of Z-Scaler for reasons that this article will try to explain. And the fact is that the shares of this company do not appear to be cheap - currently based on 120 million outstanding shares that the company uses in its forecast it has an enterprise value of about $4 billion and an EV/S ratio on a forward 12 month basis of about 16X. Of course, if that valuation were to be taken seriously, the shares would not be eliciting many recommendations, and I would not be writing this article.But the fact is that last quarter billings rose by 73% (or 60% when adjusted for billings of multi-year deals), and mainly because of the strong growth in billings, and the concomitant growth in deferred revenues, operating cash flow flipped from negative to positive in the quarter and for the year to date. Management, in its guidance, is attempting to keep a tight rein on investor expectations, a difficult undertaking given the opportunities it also has spelled out. Management, while not guiding billings for this current quarter, has talked about tough compares because of large transactions in prior years. Still, this current quarter is a fiscal Q4, and the company, disruptive as its technology is, still uses old-fashioned commission plans that include quotas and accelerators. The company is likely to achieve significantly greater sequential growth than it has forecast, and in turn that will set a higher base for growth to be forecast for FY 2019. Obviously, it would be mistaken to extrapolate some relationship between guidance and reality after the results of a single quarter - but no one buying the shares is thinking about an EV/S of 16X as anything other than a polite fiction. Investors are simply performing a rational calculation, some of which I explore below, that the opportunity set being addressed by the company, and bookings growth, are better ways of looking at valuation than using what appears to be an artificially conservative forecast provided by management on its initial quarterly earnings conference call.Let’s take it as a given that the investors in Zscaler are neither stupid or ignorant. Almost certainly, most of them are professionals with many years of investing in technology shares. As the saying goes, this is not their first rodeo. When a new paradigm comes to town, the forecasts of its size rarely encompass the extent of its potential. Gartner, for example is notorious in that regard as its work is based almost completely on user surveys - and users often are unaware of the alternatives being offered. Just as a confession, the first time around when I saw the Salesforce app I didn't think it was much more than a glorified spread sheet. Healthy skepticism can often help with understanding a paradigm shift. A bit of a sententious statement, I suppose, but not necessarily wrong for all of that.For many years, the cyber-security business has been about building firewalls and establishing end-point security. Some relatively large companies have been built on that foundation. For some years now, Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW) has been considered to be the clear leader in the space and has achieved stunning results, with alternatives such as Checkpoint (NASDAQ:CHKP), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Hewlett-Packard (HPE) and even IBM (IBM) and Symantec (SYMC) achieving decent scale. In addition, there are literally scores of smaller vendors who offer specific cyber-security capabilities for particular use cases. I don’t propose to recapitulate the history of the firewall space - one can easily enough read through Wiki and other sources to detail its evolution. But firewalls of some kind or another been around for 30 years or so by now, and while there have been many technology improvements, the basic concept of a firewall, even when it is called “next generation” is still more or less the same as it was when the first appliances were designed and deployed.Along the way, several things have happened. One considerable change relates to data types. Much of the data that has to be protected these days is delivered from or read to mobile devices. In addition, much data is now crossing the web, to and from data centers. This shift in the data transport paradigm requires new kinds of protection. That is the specific problem which  Zscaler's technology is aimed at.But of equal and perhaps more importance is the replacement of a firewall paradigm with something else. For those readers who haven’t had to deal with cyber security or haven’t completely understood how it works (and I confess that my software knowledge is far more focused on enterprise apps than on security, given my erstwhile career) cyber security has been based on establishing a protected castle with a variety of gateways that must cross over moats that surround a typical data center. One of the problems is that the approach was never supposed to have all of the gateways it now has across the moats, and in turn this has meant the necessity that users have to buy new, specific-purpose appliances to protect the all of the additional gateways. This can play havoc with network performance similar to the way that toll barriers used to slowdown traffic before the advent of cashless tolling.Another approach has been that of what is called a hub and spoke configuration, somewhat similar to the way airlines run their networks. This is facilitated by what are called virtual private networks (VPNs) which provide “as needed” connections. This, in turn, usually leads to massive sprawl and complexity, an environment which is fertile soil for hackers.Along the way, Microsoft Office 365 has come to replace previous on-premise ways of creating and using data in most large enterprises. I think many readers are familiar with just how much data now crosses the Internet through Exchange and SharePoint and this kind of traffic can overwhelm legacy data protection strategies. And finally, lots of work is now done on a mobile basis. Needless to say, it has proven more than a little difficult to protect data that crosses the Internet to and from mobile devices, and yet that is the data type whose use is growing the most rapidly.Zscaler set out to create a different paradigm to improve the user experience and improve data security. The Zscaler Internet Access solution or ZIA securely connects users to externally managed applications - that is to say modern SaaS applications. This solution bundle is today by far the principle offering of the company. Zscaler also offers ZPA which allows users specific access to specific applications without the “untidiness” of the current VPN offerings. Being able to retire VPN's is a major benefit for many users.There are a variety of benefits from the Zscaler approach. One benefit, which I suppose is so self evident that it has to be unquestioned, is that because of the architecture of ZIA, the data has a much shorter path to its destination, and this improves response time. Again, self evidently having large purpose built data centers (Zscaler has over 100 at the moment) is almost certainly going to be more efficient in terms of minimizing processing overhead, further reducing latency.ZS says, and it is most likely something that can be readily validated, that its approach eliminates certain network security costs. In addition, and something validated at the company's most recent user group, Zia has proven much simpler than what most large users have today, and this has resulted in improving the productivity of network administrators and security personnel.Over time, many companies are going to build networks based on receiving data from the IoT. As traffic from IoT applications balloons, some appropriate means needs to be deployed to secure that traffic - the opportunities for mischief within the IoT dwarf what we have seen to date. Does anyone want to come home to either an ice-cold home or an overdone roast, or be held to ransom by someone who captures that access?The company’s approach offers user benefits and it is also quite unique, bolstered as it is by 100 issued and pending patents. These most notably include a proprietary TCP/IP stack, as well as the company’s multi-tenant distributed cloud security platform. OK, I have only a moderate understanding of the picto-graph that represents this architecture including a Central Authority, enforcement nodes and Nanolog servers shown in the company's S-1. I am not sure that readers really need to have a complete grounding in network security to understand that this approach is new, more efficient, provides a better user experience most of the time and seems to be proprietary. The approach incorporates some components of security solutions that people have historically bought from Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and from companies that offer single user sign-on technology such as Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA).I think what readers might best focus on is the successful use cases that the company describes both in its prospectus and Web site - these are pretty straightforward and provide the best evidence available with regards to user benefits. The customers that are described are well known and the use cases are typical of the issues that have to be remediated in order for end-users to get maximum benefits out of their inevitable transitions to the web.I am sure some readers will dismiss some claims that Zscaler has made as hype or impossible to achieve or capable of replication through other paradigms. In some ways, the service offered by Zscaler seems quite far removed from what has been considered the standard approach to network security in the past. In its latest quarter, the company has a dollar based net retention rate of 120% on a trailing twelve-month basis, up noticeably from a year earlier, and comparable to the rate reported for the prior quarter. Net retention rates will move around for many companies, including this one, based on the mix between sales to new users and sales to existing clients. That said, 120% is a reasonable metric especially when considering the very strong performance of bookings last quarter. While there are companies with higher dollar-based net retention rates, the combination of Zscaler's net retention rate, and the massive growth in bookings, suggest that users believe that it's delivering on its performance claims and it establishing a large reference base.At this point, Zscaler is not focused on replacing firewalls as a specific sales strategy, although that does happen when it sells what it describes as “transformation bundles” that include a Cloud Firewall as well as a Cloud Sandbox. Most of what Zscaler sells are greenfield opportunities, where a new network is being designed and deployed and that will probably remain its leading sales target into the future, although the CEO mentioned on the conference call that some retail applications have resulted in a ""fair amount of replacement of firewalls in some local branches.""The theme that's marketed by Zscaler these days is “transformation” in which firewalls as they have been known and deployed for 25 years are no longer present. Much of the new paradigm includes what is called a proxy architecture and is based on virtualized technology. The security solutions that are offered by ZS are designed to be incorporated into SDNs. This appears to be the world into which essentially all larger enterprises are moving. Earlier in this article I called out what this company has named ZPA, or Zscaler Private Access, as one of the company's important offerings. ZPA, and the architecture it supports, is really the future direction of this company, although it is still less than 5% of revenues. Last quarter was the strongest quarter for ZPA in terms of new business and upsell in the company’s history. The quarter saw the first seven-figure annual recurring revenue contract for ZPA, which came less than two years after the release of that product. Without pushing the point, there are self-evidently synergies between some of the technologies offered by this company and those offered by VMware and also Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX).That said, however, the opportunities both for the replacement of firewalls and web security gateways is obviously enormous. I haven’t specifically called out a TAM in this article and that is deliberate. At the least, the TAM is some part of the $18 billion that IDC/ZS believes is being spent on traditional firewall solutions that can be replaced with current Zscaler technology. That is enormous, of course, for a company just passing a $200 million annual sales rate, but still is not the entire opportunity.One of the ways that analysts, and presumably investors, have chosen to value this name is based on some recognition that the replacement of firewalls, whether it is the company’s sales tactic or not, is going to happen, and that this company is likely to get a noticeable share of that pie. The value of the installed base of firewalls is enormous. As use cases expand where the objective of the project is achieved by supplanting firewalls with this technology, and as cloud security becomes more of a focus on the part of users, it seems more or less inevitable that the security paradigm will shift in the direction that is being sold by ZS. That doesn’t mean that all firewalls and data security appliances will soon be regarded as junk although articles such as the one linked here abound suggesting that such an evolution is likely. It does, however, partially provide investors with a basis for the justification they might need to justify owning these shares.From my perspective, which is more financial and sales than technology, the fact that so much of this company’s business is based on long-term commitments is telling. At this point, more than 75% of the deals Zscaler is signing are for three years or more. That's a pretty substantial commitment, and one that isn’t engendered by any special incentives or terms to users, although sales people are incented for bringing in longer-term deals.It would be mistaken to imagine that Zscaler’s progress and potential has gone unnoticed by competitors. At the very least, Palo Alto has been run by executives who focus on market share, and on growth, to the exclusion of much else. I personally believe that Palo Alto sees Zscaler as a significant threat and has appointed a new CEO who can help that company find competitive offerings through acquisitions. Zscaler has a very experienced and well recognized CEO in Jay Chaudry who has shepherded a bunch of cyber security start-ups to a favorable end from the point of view of investors. Mr. Chaudry, when asked about competition, said that it is spotty. At this point, it seems that Zscaler may be having a substantial impact on Blue Coat, a part of Symantec. Certainly Symantec's latest results and guidance might lead some observers to imagine that something has upended its growth expectations. Industry gossip, and Symantec operating results, suggest that its Blue Coat operation has run into difficulties - most likely of a competitive nature. Symantec has patent litigation pending against this company with regard to its ZPA technology. I assume part of the litigation is because of the competitive inroads that ZS has made vis-a-vis Symantec. Litigation expense is not insubstantial given this company's scale, and it ran at a $15 million annual rate last quarter. I have no way of forecasting the specific outcome of this matter, and yet I imagine, that like many other IP lawsuits in this business, it will ultimately be settled without material consequence to the defendant.There are companies such as Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) which have introduced an application access solution as well as a product it calls CloudPlayer. Zscaler does sell VPN replacement solutions using ZPA. The company does see incumbent vendors in those situations, and so far has had a strong win rate. But to some extent, a technology such as ZPA is really in a different place than traditional VPNs which have a long history.At this point, it appears that no one vendor is offering a comparable architecture to that which is sold by this company. During the conference call, the CEO called out a large ZS win at a Fortune 500 medical device company that was won without any competitive bake-offs or best and final submissions. I find this to be a very telling win, in that it suggests both the capacity of what Zscaler sells, and that fact that at the moment, competition for the particular architecture that is offered is not present. As reported by the CEO, the CIO of the client had determined that he was ""done with appliances and a hybrid approach"" and in turn that led to the ZS procurement. I doubt that happens often currently, or will happen often in the future. But I can well imagine that CIOs who have to manage complex networks with spaghetti-like connections have some degree of unease with a strategy that requires procuring and managing multiple appliances, often from different vendors and of different kinds and protocols to guard each gateway. As mentioned earlier, the company emphasizes its transformational bundles as its most important offering, and transformation as this company defines, is becoming an increasing component of the business of this company. These transformational bundles are increasing ASPs and are a factor in the company's path to profitability. Last quarter's results, that were reported earlier this month, were the first the company has made as a public entity. Gross margins increased about 200 basis points year on year to around 81% on a GAAP basis. The company is growing product revenues faster than services by a significant factor, and this should allow gross margins to rise some more. Management indicated that it would be increasing the level of disclosure with regards to its revenue mix when it releases annual results sometime in September.The company’s largest operating expense is sales and marketing. Sales and marketing fell to 61% of revenues last quarter, down from 63% of revenues the prior year, again on a GAAP basis. Overall, the company’s GAAP loss from operations was 18%, down from 23% the prior year. The company does use some noticeable level of stock based comp, although that figure was constrained last quarter. That's probably more a function of the relatively small sequential increase in research and development spend because of some conscious policy regarding that metric. Overall, stock based comp was 6% of revenues last quarter compared to 5% of revenues in the same quarter the preceding year.The company has projected a relatively slow cadence in its increase in expenses - perhaps too slow in terms of maximizing growth. Management has said that it is indeed focused on maximizing top-line performance and I would not be surprised to see the company ramp spending for both research and development and sales and marketing spend a bit faster going forward than has been the case in the recent past. No one buying these shares at this point is doing so because of their expectation of any near-term EPS. Cash flow will probably rise at an accelerated pace going forward because of the strong level of multi-year bookings, but there is still plenty of space between a noticeable rate of free cash flow returns, and the company’s current operating cash flow performance.In writing for this site, I try to identify names that I think will be category leaders for years to come. Not all category leaders are going to be great trades, or not great trades all of the time. And markets are not always willing to pay premium valuations for hyper growth. Further, I would observe that the guidance provided by the company is not at levels that support its valuation. I would not be recommending these shares if I had any belief that growth compression would be starting at this level of revenues, or that sequential growth this quarter would be marginal as was implied by the company's forecast. Perhaps tellingly, no analyst chose to ask the company about the lack of sequential growth, from which I infer that no one actually thinks it will happen that way. And yes, I'm really hoping for a noticeable pullback, any pullback of substance as an entry point.Many readers will find the valuation hurdle just too great for them to handle in terms of acquiring the shares at current valuations. But that will probably be true in three months, or six months, as the company’s growth most likely accelerates and doesn’t compress. Many analysts who cover the name, mainly from the underwriting group, rate the shares a hold at this point with an average price target reported to First Call of a bit less than $37/share. I have established a starter position in my portfolio, and I will be planning to scale into this name opportunistically.At this point, my belief is that Zscaler has the opportunity to dramatically disrupt the cyber-security space as it has been, and to become one of the leading vendors of cyber-security solutions. That kind of expectation can indeed support a premium valuation, although I understand that there will be bumps in the road based both on market conditions and on news events, primarily those related both to reports of price competition and to strategic products introduced by competitors. Zscaler shares will not be for all readers, but if readers are investors with a decent time horizon, this is an opportunity for an investment producing lots of positive alpha and not an investment with an absurd valuation."
4157343,25120,2018-03-18T01:34:19-04:00,"Zscaler offers cloud security and is growing its sales at an impressive and stable clip for quite a while now.Losses are coming down quickly (on a relative basis), as forward billing multiples look very reasonable.I like the potential of the company and the reasonable forward billings multiples in a growing market at the IPO price, yet see no value at the post-IPO levels.","Zscaler (ZS) is an interesting IPO in the cloud security space, demonstrating on 50% year-on-year growth for quite a few years already, with operating losses coming down on a relative basis.Given the growth rates posted, narrowing operating losses (on a relative basis) and forward sales multiples being reasonable (if we include the changes in deferred revenues), I see why investors like Zscaler at the offer price. That being said, any potential relative value has completely been wiped out following an 80% run on the opening day.Zscaler promises to offer security and accessibility in a world which is rapidly moving towards mobility. Instead of accessing the corporate networks from the office, users are now using data on the road, at work and at home, often through various devices.The company has been founded back in 2007 as it looked to bring solutions for this emerging problem. The company has therefore come up with a changed architectural design and approach to network security. The company offers its security from its cloud platform which architecture is spread out over 100 data centers across the globe.Since being founded a decade ago the company has signed up 2,800 customers across various industries, which is quite an impressive performance. These customers are very happy with the services of Zscaler. Between the fiscal year of 2016 and 2017, the user count was up more than 14%, indicating that revenues per user are up significantly as revenues grew by more than 50% year on year last year.Another big plus, CEO and founder Jay Chaudhry holds a big stake in the business, even after the offering. This vote of confidence has brought comfort to investors buying into the offering which comes on top of his strong track record as a serial entrepreneur.Zscaler originally aimed to sell 10 million shares at $10-$12 per share, but later upwards revised the offering to 12 million shares in a $13-$15 range. In the end, the company ended up setting a price of $16 per share, thereby raising $192 million in gross proceeds, money needed to fund current operating losses.Following the deal, there are 117.3 million shares outstanding, valuing this business at $1.88 billion. As the company operates with $72 million in net cash ahead of the IPO, the company will operate with roughly $250 million in net cash if we include the offering proceeds, valuing operating assets at little over $1.6 billion.The company has a fiscal year which ends in July. The company reported revenues of nearly $53.7 million for its fiscal year of 2015 on which it lost more than $12.4 million. Revenues were up 50% to 2016 and hit $80.3 million, yet operating losses more than doubled to $26.8 million.Growth continued in 2017 and even accelerated. Total revenues were up nearly 57% to $125.7 million as operating losses rose further to $35.1 million. The only positive thing is that relative losses were narrowing towards 27.9% of sales, a more than 5-point improvement from the year before.The company has seen continued momentum in the first half of its fiscal year of 2018 as revenues were up 51% to $84.8 million. While operating losses rose from $14.5 million to $17.7 million, operating losses narrowed towards the -20% margin level. The current loss rate of $35 million is, however, relatively modest given the strong net cash position.With revenues trending at a rate in excess of $170 million, operating assets are valued at roughly 10 times sales, which is high, but justifiable given the opportunity and current +50% growth rate. Key to sustaining the valuation is continued growth as well as margin improvements being delivered upon.The risks for the business are plentiful despite growth and a large market opportunity. Financial losses are a concern, but these concerns are alleviated through strong growth, narrowing losses and sizeable cash balances. More worrying is judging how the industry will evolve as the company competes against large and financially resourceful competitors such as Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), Symantec (SYMC), F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV) and many others. While stiff competition is a big worry, these players are willing to make deals as well at premiums if they recognise the value in the technology.The 10 times sales multiple is rich but could be justifiable given the pace at which the business is growing, as current industry leaders found themselves in a similar valuation place a few years ago. Furthermore, note that revenue multiples are somewhat understated as many contracts are recognised over time.Adjusted for that, you end up with ""calculated billings"" being the sum of recorded revenues + changes in deferred revenues. These ""billings"" already hit $215 million per year at this point in time, reducing multiples to 7.5 times annualised calculated billings. There is just one problem. On top of the hiked IPO price, shares trade with gains of roughly 80% on their opening day to levels at $29 at the moment of writing. This values operating assets at little over $3 billion, equivalent to nearly 15 times the annual billings, being a far too steep multiple for me."
4155415,103653,2018-03-11T18:18:09-04:00,"We will use a comparable multiples method to get an intrinsic valuation of Zscaler.We believe that the IPO is being sold at a very expensive price, as competitors are trading at a cheaper market valuation.The growth has been very impressive, but the company will not be able to do the same forever.","From now on, we will be assessing the fastest-growing companies in the US and the new IPOs. We commenced doing so, since, in our view, there is a lot to review in this space.Today, we will provide an analysis of Zscaler, Inc (ZS), which is right now preparing for its IPO. In Marc 2018, the shares are expected to commence trading at $10-$12. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are working on the sale of 10 million shares.What will you find in this piece? We will review the activities of the company, its competitors, the total outstanding shares including the convertible securities, and the price to be paid by new shareholders. Our main thesis is that the shares are being sold at somewhat overhyped price.Zscaler was founded in 2007. The company was an early adopter, which was able to predict that the internet would be the new corporate network thanks to new cloud technologies.The company noted in its prospectus that it was pioneer in the design of a ""security cloud that represents a fundamental shift in the architectural design and approach to network security."" The company seems like an interesting opportunity, as it is capitalizing on the new way the businesses operate:What's the company offering?Zscaler enables secure migration of corporate applications from the client's data center to the cloud. Two services are offered:How big is the market?The prospectus reads that an amount of $17.7 billion annually is expended on security applications, which would not be necessary with the platform provided by Zscaler.The next question is whether the company will be able to get a piece of the cake. To be honest, the company has already done a terrific work and has exhibited significant growth. Undoubtedly, after the results of the last year, it is the perfect time to do an IPO.As mentioned, the most recent results have been astonishing. The revenue has gone from $53.7 million in 2015 to $125.7 million in 2017. It is more than 50% CAGR, which is quite impressive. Have a look at the following image:SourceHowever, from this image, we are able to see the first issue. The most significant expense in the P&L is the sales and marketing expenses. The company is paying approximately 63% of its revenues in sales expenditure. Additionally, it has been growing these expenses also at a high rate; 39% to 76% increase in the last three years.What is our take?As the company has been operating since 2007, we believe that it had already time to show its products to many companies. In our view, this fact and the fact that the company is heavily expending in sales to sell its software mean that it did not design a game changer platform. It is a great solution, but requires quite a bit of investment in sales expense.As a result, we believe that if the company decreases the amount of sales, the revenues will not grow as much. It may be easy to go from $32 million invested in sales expenditure to $56 million. The growth obtained was impressive. However, now that the company spends $79 million in sales, it will be more difficult to expend 75% more in 2018, because the company will have no cash. As of January 31, 2018, the company showed $71 million in cash holding in the balance sheet.In conclusion, we will not be expecting the same marketing expenses in the future, so the sales figure may not grow at the same pace. In line with this rationale, in our view, it does not make any sense to believe that revenue growth will stay at 50% CAGR. While many people out there are noting this detail to promote the IPO, the investors need to be aware.We opted to revise the EV/Revenues ratio of other competitors to calculate what should be the intrinsic value of the shares. Many of them have somewhat different capital structure and are larger, thus readers may say that they cannot be compared. Fair enough; however, we believe that it would give an approximate metric to assess the value of this business.Have a look at the EV/Revenue of each of them:Given the size of Zscaler, the most suitable peer could be FTNT. In addition, PANW and SYMC could be ignored, as they hold debt while Zscaler does not.Let's turn the page and see the expected EV that Zscaler should have. The revenue in 2017 was $125 million. Thus, using an EV/EBITDA range of 5x-8x, the EV should be between $625 million and $1,000 million.Let's go now to the market capitalization. The company has no debt, but holds $87 million in cash. As a result, the market cap should be approximately equal to $721-$1,087 million. Other people may get other figures using the balance sheet for the period ended in January 2018. However, the figures don't change a lot.Now, let's take into account the total shares outstanding. The company is selling 10 million shares, but there is approximately 108 million convertible preferred stock that can be converted into one common stock. Additionally, there is common stock issued before the IPO.As a result, the estimated value of each share should be between $4.56 and $6.87 ($721-$1,087 million/157,998,166 shares). We can imagine that market participants using a DCF model may be getting a higher number, since the company is growing at a high pace. We did not use this technique, because the FCF and the EBITDA reported by the company are negative.In this piece, we used a comparable multiples method to assess the valuation of Zscaler shares. In our view, the shares are sold at $10 while the valuation of peers gives a much lower intrinsic valuation. DCF models may provide a higher figure, since the growth is very significant on this name. However, investors need to be careful; as the sales expenditures decrease, we will be expecting the company to lose momentum, which may make the share price decline in the market."

The research firm expects the healthcare vertical to command the highest share of the market. Growth in the industry will continue to be driven by the increasing adoption of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) among organizations and the need for organizations to shift from traditional security to advanced security to protect the critical assets from potential threats. San Jose-based Zscaler (SCALE) is looking to make its mark in this high growth market.Zscaler's FinancialsSerial entrepreneur Jay Chaudhry set up Zscaler with the idea of creating a cloud security company that featured a network of check-posts within data centers so that traffic could get directed to the nearest data center for inspection and security. Zscaler launched its Security-as-a-Service platform to deploy security into the Internet backbone. Today, it has more than 15 million users across 5,000 organizations globally with its customer list including names like GE (NYSE:GE), Nestlé (OTCPK:NSRGY), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Schneider Electric (OTCPK:SBGSY), the U.S. Marines, NATO and the National Health Service in the UK.Zscaler keeps its financials confidential. It follows a subscription-based model for revenues. It charges its customers an annual fee based on the level of features used and the number of users protected. According to management, the revenue growth is strong. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, revenues grew 400% over the year. The company has been cash flow positive for the past three years. Refreshing! Zscaler, unlike others in the Unicorn age, does not believe in propagating a culture that makes it acceptable to report big losses.The company was initially bootstrapped and subsequently raised venture funding in 2012. It has raised $148 million in funding from investors including EMC, Google Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners and TPG Growth. In September 2015, the company raised $110 million at a valuation of over $1 billion.Zscaler's Growing PartnershipsUntil last year, Zscaler had been focused on going to market through network providers instead of distributors. Of late, that has been changing. The company is now increasing its focus on the development of channel sales and marketing. As organizations continue to allow employees to bring their own devices, there is a bigger need for cybersecurity and also a presence of inconsistent security across organizations. To manage this better, Zscaler also will be stepping up cyber awareness and threat detection knowledge among its partners.Zscaler has been expanding through multiple partnerships with vendors. The company is now growing its partnership ecosystem to include Cloud Application Security Brokers (CASBs) and has entered into agreements with CipherCloud, CloudLock and Skyhigh Networks. Through the partnerships, Zscaler's platform will continue to offer cloud-based security by delivering it as a pre-integrated solution to provide visibility, control and protection for cloud services.Analysts believe that Zscaler may be ready to go public soon, but the company has a different opinion. It is confident that it will go public when the timing is right. For now, it is enjoying the biggest advantage of remaining private - the ability to focus on a long-term vision and not have to worry about short-term quarterly reports. There also are a few in the market who believe Zscaler could be a potential target for the likes of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) which is looking to up its security services offering."
4150192,104186,2018-02-23T14:00:26-05:00,"Zscaler, a tech company aiming to offer cloud security solutions, has filed for an IPO worth $100 million.Cloud security is a growing field where Zscaler has been massively growing with its unique solutions.The company is under suit for patent infringement, with the more serious case coming from competitor Symantec.There is not enough information at present to reach a decision, but investors should like this company’s potential.","The 2018 IPO market has seen quite a few smaller companies aim to go public, and now we have another one. Tech company Zscaler Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) has filed for a $100 million offering, though this amount is almost certainly a placeholder used to calculate fees. TechCrunch reported last October that Zscaler had filed confidentially and had planned to go public by the end of 2017, and that Zscaler had raised capital at a $1 billion valuation in the past.Because this IPO was recently filed and details remain sparse, it is currently impossible to give a firm assessment of what investors should think of the offering. But by understanding this company’s growth potential, investors can prepare themselves better when more information is revealed and the company finally IPOs in March. This would make it the first Bay Area tech IPO since last November and is reason enough to whet your appetite.A look at Zscaler’s SEC report indicates that it was incorporated in 2007 as they understood that the then developing cloud network would need stronger security. Small and large businesses use the cloud, but widely publicized hacking incidents have made it clear that better security solutions are needed. According to Forrester, the public cloud services market will reach $236 billion by 2020, and cloud security spending will reach $3.5 billion by 2021. The result is a large, thriving market which is no longer sufficient for a traditional security approach where firewalls attempt to isolate a corporate network from the world.Zscaler works by offering their own security cloud which connects the right user to the right applications and creates a permanent inspection of internet traffic. And because cloud security systems is still new and developing, there is a general lack of large competitors who could out-muscle Zscaler.Though there is one competitor which has certainly tried. In what is probably the most concerning aspect of this IPO, Zscaler has been sued by rival security firm Symantec. CRN reported in December 2016 that Symantec (SYMC) alleged that Zscaler had violated seven of the patents in its portfolio relating to web security and access control among other measures.Zscaler alleged that this is a classic case of an established company looking crush a rising star with lawsuits. In the SEC report, it states that the litigation is still in an early stage but that it was vigorously defending itself. Zscaler is also defending itself in another patent lawsuit from tech security company Finjan.Like many tech IPOs, Zscaler boasts solid revenue growth but suffers from a lack of profitability. It reported a revenue of $53 million in the 2015 fiscal year, which eventually grew to $126 million in the 2017 fiscal year and $84 million in the six months ending January 31, 2018. Net losses grew from $13 million in 2015 to $35 million in 2017, largely due to increased expenses in marketing as well as research and development. Furthermore, Zscaler also reported owning $188 million in total assets compared to $149 million in total liabilities.While the increasing net losses are disappointing, it is not a serious concern as Zscaler does report positive gross profits. Zscaler’s revenue numbers are also good as the company has been growing at about the same rate from 2015 to 2018. This means that it is less likely to fall into the trap of being unprofitable while watching revenue shrink.Zscaler’s liabilities numbers also appear to be good as noted above, and the company states that it intends to use the raised proceedings for “general corporate purposes.” While the lack of detail is disappointing, Zscaler has plenty of time to elaborate on how what those purposes are. What is more important is that Zscaler clearly does not consider its current levels of debt a serious concern.Overall, Zscaler’s financials are perfectly fine for an emerging company in an important field, though more information is needed on its growth strategies.While there are some concerns such as the lawsuit with Symantec and Zscaler’s growing net losses, there are no serious warning signs indicating that Zscaler would be a terrible investment. As a growing company in a highly important market, investors have every reason to believe for now that Zscaler could be a solid investment.It is too soon to make a firm decision, and investors will have to wait for Zscaler to offer more detail during its roadshow and reveal how much it really intends to raise. Keep an ear on the ground for info, but be willing to give it the slight benefit of the doubt given the good information which has been revealed so far."

This IPO will be an interesting one to watch - coming off a strong first and second quarter for IPOs in 2017 with a slew of high-profile unicorn deals like Alteryx (NYSE: AYX), Cloudera (NASDAQ: CLDR), and Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA), the majority of which have done extremely well since their public launches, the IPO markets have settled and we haven't seen any new unicorn deals for a while. On that basis alone - the fact that investors are still flush with capital and hungry for new deals to invest in - Zscaler could be in for a soaring ride.More to come as Zscaler finalizes its pricing and releases the full details of the deal this week, but here's the information available so far:Zscaler's major tagline, ""security as a service,"" falls neatly in line with the rise of SaaS. Zscaler's primary value proposition is the fact that in the era of cloud applications, on-premise cybersecurity solutions have become ill-equipped to deal with Internet threats. This takes a direct jab at the likes of Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO), which has grown into a Fortune 50 company on legacy on-premise datacenter hardware and accompanying security modules.All the ""best-of-breed"" applications of the modern era exist in the cloud - SaaS applications hosted in either the vendor's data center or in a public cloud infrastructure. Popular heavyweights like Salesforce's (NYSE: CRM) Sales Cloud and Workday's (NASDAQ: WDAY) HR Platform are accessed through the Internet, not through the user's data center. According to Zscaler, this opens up an enterprise to significant risks that an on-premise security solution can't handle.Zscaler's flagship offering, the Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA), securely connects users to externally managed applications, sitting in-between the user and vendor as a middle layer. Zscaler's firewall capabilities help to protect against data leakage and manages traditional URL and DNS filtering. Here's a diagram showcasing the basic architecture:Figure 1. Zscaler Internet Access diagramSource: S-1A filingIn addition, Zscaler also offers Zscaler Private Access, which provides secure access to internally managed applications that aren't hosted in third-party clouds.The company has accumulated a base of 2,800 customers. With only 10% penetration into the Fortune 2,000, Zscaler still has a lot of growth left in front of it. Like other SaaS offerings, Zscaler is priced on a subscription basis and commands a high 122% retention rate (indicating a net upsell to existing clients), warranting the potentially high valuation in this deal.Zscaler does have a unique positioning and architecture, but it must be noted that it's not alone in the cloud security space. Longtime firewall leader Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) still dominates the arena with >$2 billion in annual revenues, and while different vendors can have different use cases, smaller cybersecurity startups typically have a harder time competing against large players in bake-offs compared to other less-critical areas of software (like HCM).For certain, however, Zscaler has shown massive growth to back its hype. The company ends its fiscal year in the summer, so its FY17 revenue figure of $125.7 million is a bit dated. Its half-year revenues through January 2018, however, show $84.8 million growing at 51% y/y, a huge growth rate comparable to other successful security IPOs like Okta. In the company's most recent quarter, its revenues of $44.9 million grew at an impressive 53% growth rate. See the company's financials below:Figure 2. Zscaler financialsSource: S-1A filingZscaler unfortunately hasn't given guidance for the following year - but if we take Zscaler's trailing twelve months revenue of $154.3 million and apply a 40% growth rate (baking in a reasonable amount of deceleration), we can estimate a forward revenue base of approximately $214.5 million, a useful starting point for valuation.Growth aside, Zscaler has also seen noticeable improvements in its profit margins. Though the company is still loss-bearing, its most recent quarterly GAAP operating margin of -14% is still markedly above the operating margin of peers like Okta (-45%), especially when considering its >50% growth. The company's common-size income statement offers a convenient view into its quarterly margin improvements over time:Figure 3. Zscaler common-size income statementSource: Zscaler S-1A filingGross margins in Zscaler's most recent quarter improved 300 bps to 81%, and over time as the company continues to scale, it has meaningfully ratcheted down its sales and marketing expenses to a smaller percentage of revenues (like most software companies, this is the largest expense category that fuels growth).Overall net losses at a -14% margin, as well as a free cash flow margin of -16% in the trailing six months, are relatively modest compared to other high-growth SaaS companies. Perhaps it's the fact that Zscaler is backed by TPG and rooted in the more conservative, private equity style of management - not by a typical VC which expounds the values of growth at all costs. SailPoint (NASDAQ: SAIL), an identity governance management platform that went public last year and is also backed by a PE firm (Thoma Bravo, an equally powerhouse name), has churned out a positive operating margin despite high growth and has soared since its IPO. Modeling Zscaler after SailPoint wouldn't yield so bad of an outcome.Zscaler has yet to finalize its pricing (usually finalized the evening before the IPO), but in its amended S-1 filing, it has pointed to an initial range of $10-$12 per share. With 10 million shares being offered and a post-IPO capitalization of 115.6 million shares, the company will tout a valuation of $1.27 billion at the $11 midpoint.Prior to going public, Zscaler has had a relatively limited funding history, at least compared to other software companies that have gone to fund Series F and G rounds. Zscaler, on the other hand, has only gone through two rounds and raised a modest total of $148 million, as seen in the Crunchbase report below:Source: CrunchbaseThe TPG round was reportedly done at a >$1 billion valuation - so if the $11 pricing holds, and excluding any post-IPO gains, TPG doesn't stand to make the 3-10x returns that VCs typically expect from IPOs, at least not yet.If we take Zscaler's implied $1.27 billion launching market cap and compare it against the $214.5 million in estimated forward revenues we calculated earlier, this implies a starting valuation of ~6x revenues. Netting out Zscaler's net cash of $71.6 million as well as its estimated $96.9 million of gross proceeds from the IPO (which ultimately depends on its final pricing), Zscaler's enterprise value goes down to $1.10 billion - or a 5.2x EV/FTM revenue multiple.This is a cheap multiple that will almost certainly either see a last-minute range revision before the IPO or a Day 1 spike that initiates trading way above the $10-$12 range (or both). I'd say Zscaler is a buy anywhere under 6.5x EV/FTM revenues, implying a price target of $13.50. More than likely, the IPO will run far away from that price.It's difficult to render a buy-sell decision without complete information on Zscaler's ultimate pricing, but it's useful to have a feel for the company's valuation so you don't buy blindly on the first day of trading. At first glance, however, Zscaler looks like a top-notch business that has amassed quite a substantial customer list and meaningful revenue scale, despite relatively intense competition in the cloud security space. Keep a close eye on this deal as it nears its expected IPO later this week."

Billion-Dollar Unicorn Zscaler (SCALE) has been named a leader in the Gartner Secure Web Gateway Magic Quadrant for the seventh consecutive year.San Jose-based Zscaler was founded by serial entrepreneur Jay Chaudhury in 2008. After successfully flipping one of his many startups, Jay realized that his next challenge would be to create something that would have a lasting impact in the market. It was then that he came up with the idea of ZScaler.Jay already had seen a lot of cloud-based companies and realized that security also could be offered through the cloud. He wanted to offer web security in the cloud that would be able to cater to the rapidly growing mobile world by integrating point products. He did not want to rely on the old-school security model of having physical proxy devices installed at corporate locations. Instead, he wanted to build a network of checkposts within data centers so that traffic could get directed to the nearest data center for inspection and security. With this idea in his mind, he hired his development team to build a scalable proxy.Soon, Zscaler had launched its Security-as-a-Service platform to deploy security into the Internet backbone. Today it delivers unified, carrier-grade internet security, next generation firewall, web security, sandboxing/advanced persistent threat (NYSEMKT:APT) protection, data loss prevention, SSL inspection, traffic shaping, policy management and threat intelligence to more than 15 million users across 5,000 organizations globally, including 50 of the Fortune 500. Its customer list includes names like United Airlines, NBC, GE, Nestlé, Schneider Electric, the United States Marines, NATO, and the National Health Services of the UK.Its competitors include Forcepoint, Blue Coat, as well as big players like Cisco, Symantec, and McAfee.Zscaler does not disclose details of its financials. It follows a subscription-based model for revenues. It charges its customers an annual fee based on the level of features used and the number of users protected. According to management, revenue growth is strong and for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, revenues grew 400% over the year. The company also claimed to be cash flow positive.Zscaler was initially bootstrapped and subsequently raised venture funding for $38 million in 2012. It has so far raised $148 million in funding from investors including EMC, Google Capital, Lightspeed Ventures Partners, and TPG Growth. In September 2015, Zscaler raised $110 million at a valuation of over $1 billion.In February, Zscaler hired a new CFO Remo Canessa, who had led the IPOs of Infoblox in 2012 and NetScreen Technologies in 2001. Around this time, former Cisco Systems executive Charles H. Giancarlo also joined its board. In June, it was reported to be interviewing underwriters for an IPO that could value it at $2 billion. Recent reports suggest that Zscaler has filed confidentially for an IPO."

At a first glance, this valuation looks incredibly high for a company which generated $64 million in sales in 2018 on which it reported an operating loss of $27 million.Growth slowed down to 50% in the first half of the year, with revenues running at run rate of $140 million a year, reducing sales multiples to 37 times annualized sales.The 46% revenue growth for the second quarter still looks compelling, yet this multiple is high, even as the company has effectively reached break-even levels.

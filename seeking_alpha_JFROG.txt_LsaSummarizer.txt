Judging by the trading action since the public offering, investors have held good believe in the prospects for the company, yet I am not too impressed with recent operating performance.The combination of the sales multiple, growth rate, and margin potential makes that I turned cautious, furthermore having the feeling that the solution is more of a nice to have rather than being the absolute crucial piece of software/service which companies need.After factoring in the net cash position, I peg operating asset valuations around $5.9 billion, which based on the annualised revenue multiple for the third quarter comes down to 38 times sales, all while growth has slowed down, thereby not creating a great set-up.

At a first glance, this valuation looks incredibly high for a company which generated $64 million in sales in 2018 on which it reported an operating loss of $27 million.Revenues rose 65% in 2019 to $105 million, with operating losses narrowing in a big way to $7 million, but nonetheless operating assets were valued at 51 times 2019 sales!The company reported adjusted operating earnings of $5.1 million in the third quarter, and this number is set to fall to a midpoint of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter, suggesting some real deleverage as well!
